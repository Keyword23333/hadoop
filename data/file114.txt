1140131 americans today spend almost as much on bandwidth the capacity to move information as we do on energy a family of four likely spends several hundred dollars a month on cellphones cable television and internet connections which is about what we spend on gas and heating oil
1140132 like energy bandwidth is an essential economic input you cant run an engine without gas or a cellphone without bandwidth both are also resources controlled by a tight group of producers whether oil companies and middle eastern nations or communications companies like at amp t comcast and vodafone thats why as with energy we need to develop alternative sources of bandwidth wired connections to the home cable and telephone lines are the major way that americans move information in the united states and in most of the world a monopoly or duopoly controls the pipes that supply homes with information these companies primarily phone and cable companies have a natural interest in controlling supply to maintain price levels and extract maximum profit from their investments similar to how opec sets production quotas to guarantee high prices

1140227 now you have gone almost full circle on this kind of stuff and i dont see it changing because what few standards are left are just diminishing and diminishing week by week it seems so how will it ever come back unless there is a total sea change in the way that publications begin to look at things thats certainly not going to happen for years and years now

1140232 we have very effective treatments for cancer in adolescents but they only work if the patient takes them
1140233 this study shows that a strategically designed video game can be a powerful new tool to enhance the impact of medical treatment by motivating healthy behavior in the patient
1140234 we now know that games can induce positive changes in the way individuals manage their health
1140235 the game not only motivates positive health behavior it also gives players a greater sense of power and control over their disease in fact that seems to be its key ingredient
1140236 the process to create and evaluate re mission was highly collaborative often challenging and an incredible learning experience

1140241 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1140242 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1140243 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1140244 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1140245 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1140246 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1140247 just ask for it its like buying a car a lot of people think the price is set but its not

1140251 kids younger than ten are motivated to choose foods in large part because theyre perceived as fun and they want a treat or reward
1140252 kids account for almost one third of all consumption of snack oriented convenience food products among those products fruit is the top choice consumed by kids but consumption frequency for fruit declines markedly as children age
1140253 were having a bunch of kids over today do we need to have something more kid friendly for them to eat

1140258 i wonder what sangria recipe lydia serves with her tapas
1140259 and then i did that and then i did this
1140260 tricia molloy the author and i met each other a few years ago and i was very impressed immediately with her as a person as well as an author
1140261 you know it wouldnt be so bad if i just died right now
1140262 ah that mark guy let me toss a lightning bolt at him
1140263 sorry kiddo you failed to win we gotta kill ya
1140264 like i said he was a boy quite small for his age which from his appearance i would judge to have been around six or seven
1140265 yes i suppose you could describe the iris as metallic and his pupils were vertical rather than horizontal and quite jelly like it was best not to look directly into his eyes
1140266 it would be first thing in the morning one moment and then the next my mother would be calling me for tea
1140267 i didnt say that i knew exactly where we had been while we were away
1140268 on visits it was fun we shared some good time for a short while
1140269 he got bored with me thats all i suppose i became less and less interesting to him as i grew older one day he left and never returned
1140270 not really i understood that it was the time when he would move on ive often thought about him over the years though i wonder where he is now
1140271 they thought it was a phase i was going through my mother would often ask if my friend required a place at the table and mickey would ask if she was one sandwich short of a picnic
1140272 he didnt think it was a laughing matter perhaps i reminded him of someone
1140273 well im not the first nutter weve had in the family
1140274 keep your hair on theres no need to panic no offence taken try and chill a little itll make it easier for the both of us now where were we
1140275 i should imagine so theres a whole closet full of what you might call eccentrics
1140276 can you explain a little more what you mean when you say the past
1140277 i might be able to explain it whether you will grasp it or not is another matter
1140278 hmm lets see what if i told you that its possible to seep into the past how can i put it imagine time as an onion each layer a year or a century whatever time period you want to settle for mickey taught me how to seep into those layers without ever actually leaving the place i was in flowing back through time purely from the prospective of the geographical location i was in at that moment does that make sense to you
1140279 yes well i think so i know i wasnt five so i must have been around four
1140280 trying to sleep i was in my bedroom tucked up in bed almost asleep i might have been sleeping im not sure perhaps they woke me
1140281 well not at first just a sound like something carried on the wind after a while i realised they were calling my name
1140282 they were outside but i could hear them through the window which was slightly open i think it must have been summer because it was a light evening
1140283 it sounded like many voices at first happy giggling giddy voices like whispering munchkins later i realised that there were only two of them
1140284 you compare the voices to munchkins had you recently watched the wizard of oz
1140285 dont be daft thats really funny that is there were no dvds or videos in those days and the only thing i ever watched on television was watch with mother it was later much later that i saw the film and the munchkins reminded me of the incident
1140286 so you heard the voices through the open window do you remember anything else
1140287 you actually saw something as well i had no idea tell me what you saw
1140288 well they kept on calling my name and then when they had my attention they asked me to go over to the window so i did
1140289 you got out of bed and walked over to the window is that when you saw something
1140290 not at first it took me a while to work out exactly where they were and then a little longer to work them out
1140291 quite light really but they were so small tiny i remember thinking that they must be elves
1140292 i had a book the elves and the shoemaker they looked a little like the illustrations of the elves in that book
1140293 just standing on the lawn under my window looking up at me
1140294 yes but i cant remember exactly what they said not word for word anyway i do know that they wanted me to join them they wanted me to leave my room leave the house and run away with them
1140295 to go with them but i knew that i shouldnt i remember feeling sad almost as if i had been cheated out of a great adventure
1140296 trust is important isnt it trust me for a moment then and describe the material to me
1140297 i will if you want me to its a paisley print do you want me to describe the colours also
1140298 no its quite alright do you see anything other than the paisley pattern look close
1140299 no just the paisley pattern is there something i am supposed to be looking for
1140300 what if i ask you to look closely at the bottom right hand section of the curtain on my right can you make out a peacock
1140301 now you come to mention it i can it does rather look like a peacock doesnt it its just the way the curtain folds
1140302 i saw the peacock first and then on closer inspection the paisley pattern
1140303 do you want to go back to the voices now
1140304 you know youre reading at night and hear a creak above you perhaps a tap on the window or even someone calling your name that sort of thing
1140305 do you always ignore such noises do you dismiss them make excuses for them or do you investigate what you have heard
1140306 theyre just the sounds a house makes at night a branch tapping on the window etc
1140307 how do you know you are correct if you dont get up to investigate
1140308 what about when you instinctively feel that someone is watching you that someone is stood behind you are they
1140309 tell me about the figures you see in the shadows
1140310 all sorts of things sometimes they ignore me and sometimes they simply fail to notice i am there at all
1140311 in particular the reward signal is not the place to impart to the agent prior knowledge about how to achieve what we want it to do for example a chess playing agent should be rewarded only for actually winning not for achieving subgoals such taking its opponents pieces or gaining control of the center of the board if achieving these sorts of subgoals were rewarded then the agent might find a way to achieve them without achieving the real goal for example it might find a way to take the opponents pieces even at the cost of losing the game the reward signal is your way of communicating to the robot what you want it to achieve not how you want it achieved
1140312 the three of us had a few months together before he passed away i was lucky he knew i was there and could see and hear me not everyone can see the delayed its a gift or curse of the few depending which way you look at it
1140313 like all children arthur never had any hesitation going into the light you see there is no such thing as a delayed child
1140314 i have no doubt that the living have heard or seen what they think are the ghosts of children or babies however experience has taught me that there is no such thing as a delayed youngster only those who wish you to believe that there are
1140315 the mother church of the parish is of great antiquity and stands on a commanding eminence the ascent to which is by a flight of 124 steps the church was erected in the 12th century and has undergone various changes alterations and renovations the local legend is that the site of the church was in point of fact the place chosen by spirits and fairies for the purpose on several occasions as the story relates the materials brought together for the erection of the church on an entirely different site were removed from the place originally selected to the hill or eminence on which st chads stands that this removal was the work of superhuman agency was the firm belief of our forefathers in those far distant days and we should be sorry to do or say anything which could in the remotest manner interfere with this time hallowed belief which has been handed down to us and which with vast numbers among us is received with the greatest deference and respect the site ultimately adopted under such supernatural pressure led of course to the formation of the celebrated church steps to ascend which is always considered a necessary piece of work to be performed by all visitors to our good old town to come to rochdale and not mount the steps is considered a breach of good manners as well as a serious deprivation of a very agreeable exercise the steps in fact are among our most cherished possessions and they form a most important thoroughfare with which it would be very unwise to intermeddle to the great prejudice of the inhabitants

1140324 my great grandfather big andy was a bare knuckle boxing champion i have republished the wbw post in the life section of the blog my grandfather boxed for his regiment they had a troop named the bantams during the first world war he also ran a boxing club for the unemployed during the 1920s depression and is reputedly the first person to have put the gloves on sam bamford who fought under the name jock mcavoy jock later kod the american world middleweight chamption ed baberisko that is a story in itself and would make an amazing film sir h also fought for his regiment who are as much known for their boxing and rugby skills as they are for their military ones
1140325 you were telling me about the voices and what you saw from the window
1140326 oh yes thats right i suppose thats all there is really as far as that episode is concerned
1140327 yes if that is what you want to call them
1140328 i told them that i wasnt coming out to play that i had to go back to bed and although they were disappointed they seemed to understand
1140329 did you tell anyone about what you had seen or heard
1140330 im not sure i may have done i cant remember any specific conversation about it though
1140331 and you didnt hear the voices again until you were much older
1140332 heavens no well that was the last time i saw and heard those little fellows as far as i can remember any way
1140333 yes the way you try to keep a straight face
1140334 hmm i suppose you would call him an invisible friend
1140335 oh i could both see and hear mickey only other people found it impossible to do so not everyone mind you our dog appeared to see and hear him but everyone said she was old and crackers after a while she just ignored him like all the other kids
1140336 neither i guess you could say i sensed him and then looked up to find him staring down at me
1140337 i see where were you when you first saw him
1140338 would you believe i was in the bath he scared the living daylights out of me sitting on the edge staring at me through his golden eyes as though i was something weird it was so funny i told him off for staring and he nearly fell on the floor i thought he was a bit simple at first yet he was far from it
1140339 exactly the same as other boys you knew at the time you mention he had golden eyes
1140340 its ok if you do not want to talk about him we can talk about something else if you prefer
1140341 what makes you think i dont want to talk about him
1140342 do you think the seller will accept my offer is my offer is good enough

1140359 im sorry but im engaged and im in love with her
1140360 we cannot treat our way out of this epidemic that is clear we still need a vaccine
1140361 the community is ready to do its part it is the scientists who have failed we have not figured out the right product and we still dont know what we want the product to do
1140362 the best hope of combating the hiv aids epidemic is biomedical preventive technology and the best among these would still be a vaccine
1140363 we are in an interesting and some would say difficult period
1140364 there has been a sense that every vaccine trial is do or die
1140365 most people dont understand that the product development process is rife with failures the assumption is most candidates wont work we are just looking for any signal of hope
1140366 we have to take chances you cant just stay and watch people die
1140367 we are depending on arvs but arvs dont stop hiv they just give you a longer life we have to take the chance on a vaccine because hiv is not ending it is only increasing

1140372 and yet they find time to waste an afternoon on an impeachment vote against the vice president this is why americans shake their head in wonder about the priorities of this congress
1140373 in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of vice president
1140374 purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive the citizens and congress of the united states by fabricating a threat of iraqi weapons of mass destruction to justify the use of the u s armed forces against the nation of iraq in a manner damaging to our national security interests
1140375 openly threatened aggression against the republic of iran absent any real threat to the united states
1140376 the idea of iran having a nuclear weapon is dangerous and therefore now is the time for us to work together to diplomatically solve this problem
1140377 its strengths in overt conflict are more defensive than offensive but iran has already shown it has great capability to resist outside pressure and any form of invasion and done so under far more adverse and divisive conditions than exist in iran today
1140378 this constant drumbeat of conflict is what strikes me which is not helpful and not useful
1140379 its a song in case youre being stalked by anyone and you just want them to go away and go away doesnt really work there was a comedian that once said fuck off and i would use something different if something meant the same because go away certain to hell doesnt mean the same so this is a fuck off song

1140386 poverty is the deprivation of essential assets and opportunities in which every human is entitled
1140387 a pro poor tourism policy implies a change in direction from objectives concerned with increasing overall tourism numbers and revenues to one that stresses forms of tourism that are of benefit to the poor these forms of tourism can be labor intensive include support for a role for the informal sector in tourism development should be based on tourism assets that are available to the poor and direct tourism development to areas where the poorest people live this form of tourism should also be concerned with ensuring that tourism development does not exacerbate the problems of the poor by increasing pollution making land more expensive and decreasing access to natural and cultural opportunities

1140399 shubah has related the tradition from maymum abu adbullah who related it on the authority of zayd bin arqam radiyallahu anhu and he has related it from the holy prophet sallallahu alaihi wa aalihi wassalaam
1140400 tirmidh and nas narrated the tradition and it is supported by numerous chains of transmission
1140401 this hadith is saheeh according to the chains of narrators and no one has said anything contrary to its narrators
1140402 this tradition is saheeh with the criteria of the two shuyukh al bukhari and muslim
1140403 well done ibn abi talib today you became the mawla of all believing men and women
1140404 get to know no honour reaches the position of excellence without the acceptance of ali as the wali
1140405 the holy prophet sallallahu alaihi wassalaam said that on the day of judgement allah almighty will say stop them for now they will be questioned about wilayaah of ali
1140406 ali is from me and i am from ali and after me he is the wali of every true believer
1140407 there is no doubt that allah has made a promise to me with regards to ali i asked my lord what is it allah said listen to which i replied i am listening
1140408 ali is the flag of guidence imam of the saint and the light of truth for those that follow me and is that kalima that has been made compulsory upon the believers whoever loves him loves me whoever angers ali angers me o muhammad convey these good news to ali
1140409 should they intend to decieve thee verily god sufficeth thee he it is that hath strengthened with his aid nusrat and with the company of the believers
1140410 there is no god but i alone there is no equal or partner to me muhammad is my servant and my messenger whom i supported by means of ali
1140411 when i went on miraj i saw on the pillars of arsh an inscription which i read and understood as there is no god but i alone muhammad is my servant and messenger whom i have supported by means of ali
1140412 when the chief of prophets sallallahu alaihi wa aalihi wassalaam led the prayers and the other prophets alaihimus salaam prayed behind him an angel descended and said o beloved of allah ask these apostles of allah on what condition they were granted prophethood the holy prophet sallallahu alaihi wa aalihi wassalaam posed the question and he recieved the following reply that we accept the wilayaah of you and ali

1140416 in seniors flu vaccine was not linked to a reduced risk of pneumonia
1140417 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza
1140418 however earlier studies have overestimated how well the vaccine works in reducing complications of influenza so the vaccine may not reduce the risk of complications as much as previously thought
1140419 when you look at the total population of seniors which includes people over 75 and people that have chronic health diseases lung disease heart disease diabetes and things like that we dont know if the vaccine is effective in the seniors
1140420 people with these chronic diseases are more susceptible to getting the flu and they are more likely to develop pneumonia if they do get influenza
1140421 we know that elderly people do not form sufficient antibodies to certain vaccines the flu vaccine included
1140422 in addition people in their 70s and 80s and 90s are more prone to pneumonia with or without influenza a number of these pneumonias may be secondary to other causes aside from influenza
1140423 having many people vaccinated builds up a herd immunity to disease and you create barriers to transmission
1140424 we give the flu shot primarily to prevent elderly deaths
1140425 in the best years the flu vaccine is really only 40 to 60 percent effective
1140426 there are plenty of flu related complications that are life threatening besides pneumonia
1140427 this study is a reminder that flu vaccines are not a panacea but they are valuable because they cut down on the incidence of influenza
1140428 flu shots definitely cut down on the number of flu related deaths
1140429 pues el componente sobrenatural es soso y trivial las conspiraciones son sencillamente inexistentes y la relaci n entre mulder y scully parece resuelta desde hace mucho tiempo
1140430 yo no conozco en efecto bien mayor para un hombre en cuanto alcanza la juventud que encontrar un buen amante como para un buen amante un buen amado
1140431 el amor es un sentimiento para compartir no correspondido es una tortura que se lleva nuestros mejores a os y desperdicia nuestros mejores gestos

1140433 the results of this trial show that telemedicine is efficacious for making acute medical decisions stroke telemedicine is widely implemented and discussed but despite its dissemination its efficacy has not previously been shown our results support the use of telemedicine to make urgent treatment decisions such as whether to use thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke
1140434 this is the clearest picture weve ever had of new hiv infections occurring in the united states
1140435 we have to do more as individuals communities and a nation to make sure were doing everything we can to stop the further spread of hiv
1140436 the magnitude of new infections is larger than previously thought but we have the same picture of whos at risk
1140437 these new cdc numbers lend credence to what public health officials have long been saying that hiv is alive and well and thriving in certain communities in the u s
1140438 using these advanced methods to paint a more accurate picture of the numbers of new hiv infections is important for working out where our prevention messages have worked and where there is a need for improvement its time to take a precision strike approach towards hiv prevention in this country
1140439 i wish i had friends like you do when i was your age dont take these for granted
1140440 even if investors came in saying i am totally into giving away the profits two years later they might change their mind
1140441 these companies are stewards of the whole not just stewards of maximizing shareholder wealth
1140442 there was a lack of basic infrastructure preventing this marketplace from developing more quickly
1140443 there was a lack of standards and of knowing what we mean by responsible sustainable green business there was a lack of legal structures reflecting the values of these new enterprises and there was a lack of a unifying voice for this market
1140444 the biggest fear of any company like ours is that if we merge with a strategic partner will they try to strip our values away just to save on the cost of goods
1140445 having this as a part of our operating agreement carries a lot of weight it means that whoever our strategic partner is they will be committed to our values from day one
1140446 it would give a future ben cohen of ben amp jerrys an additional ability to weigh factors in addition to the financial ones
1140447 they could say we dont have to only consider the financial offer here
1140448 this helps consumers tell which companies see sustainability as a business imperative rather than a trend
1140449 until now there have been no standards that distinguish a good company from good marketing
1140450 how do you create a brand that has meaning and makes corporations want to participate in it but isnt self serving to the member companies you want as many people to become b corporations as possible but you dont want to water down the standards
1140451 we are witnessing the birth of a new sector of the economy between the private sector and the nonprofit sector
1140452 our grandchildren will be talking about this new sector the way we talk about the nonprofit sector eventually it will be 5 7 10 percent of gdp and unlike nonprofits it will have the ability to scale up from there because it can attract capital there will be a social stock exchange lower capital gains taxes for investing in these companies and government procurement preferences all of that is going to happen but for it to happen we need to create some standards
1140453 candidates pick up steam in run up to presidential primaries
1140454 breast cancer shows up on a mammogram or imaging in two different ways a mass lesion or a spot
1140455 we feel the breast ct was superior to traditional mammography for mass lesions but mammography remains superior over breast ct for microcalcifications
1140456 one of the things that is appealing is comfort on the part of the patient
1140457 it has to be just as accurate in finding breast cancer as mammography and should not generate a higher rate of false positives
1140458 had to walk to the rocks to see the mountain view
1140459 as we now have developed treatments that are easier to take in terms of number of pills number of doses in the day and potential adverse effects and we now know there seem to be additional benefits with starting earlier the pendulum is swinging back to starting treatment earlier
1140460 also importantly is the recognition of comorbidities that should prompt you to start treatment earlier including hepatitis b or c cardiovascular risk and hiv associated necropathy
1140461 the take home message is prevention is always better than treatment which seems to be possible through the utilization of the latest diagnostic techniques
1140462 this discussion of homosexuality we are having in the church is not so significant because of what it says about homosexuality but of what it says about god
1140463 when someone stands up and says homosexuality is an abomination does that make you want to get to know god
1140464 when someone tells you that god does not care if youre a practicing homosexual or not does that make you want to get to know god
1140465 i think god wants us to be bold i think god wants us to take risks i dont think god wants us to be afraid
1140466 her priests have violated my law and profaned my holy things they have not distinguished between the holy and unholy nor have they made known the difference between the unclean and the clean and they have hidden their eyes from my sabbaths so that i am profaned among them

1140471 if he were interested in you he would call or text or drop by he does not do any of these things to him its over he doesnt need closure so find it on your own he does not want you why spend time on somone who doesnt want to give you what you want to give him respect yourself and move on

1140477 so before we even get to the stage of measuring market shares we know that we are concerned with conduct thats fundamentally necessary for the product to exist

1140523 this is not the right time to do interviews diplomats said indias unmovable stance was grounded in washingtons trade deficit with new delhi a miniscule 697 million against a us deficit with china of over 21 billion
1140524 it has been very quiet in the discussions but dont think they havent been listening its their tactic they speak up when they need to
1140525 all their invocations of development during the past years ring hollow when these major players threaten the development benefits already on the table that are absolutely vital to the vast majority of the membership said the us deputy head at the geneva mission to the wto david shark
1140526 they showed that they knew exactly what they were talking about they used facts to turn the tables on the us said an african diplomat

1140533 were going back almost 10 million years before any previously described asian anthropoid
1140534 the new fossils from india are exciting because they show that the anthropoid lineage is much more ancient than we realized
1140535 most of the fossil record of ancient primates is made up of teeth because teeth are easy to preserve and hard
1140536 occasionally we get lucky enough to have a skull to work with but in this case a few teeth is all we have
1140537 from the tooth size and structure we can say something about the animals body weight and diet because teeth have crests that are differentially developed depending on whether they ate primarily insects leaves or fruit
1140538 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1140539 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1140540 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1140541 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect
1140542 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
1140543 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
1140544 although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience
1140545 the research also has important long term application to robotics and assistive technologies capitalising on natures design is a good way of building artificial visual systems for robots as humans get visual judgments right a lot more often than the best current robot systems further knowing the situations in which humans get it wrong is a useful starting point for the design of assistive devices to help correct those errors before they have serious consequences

1140590 america faces a crisis of self government unless the american public makes its outrage about judicial supremacists loud and clear the supreme court may believe it can continue to ignore the public the american people must demand that congress use its full constitutional powers to protect america from judicial usurpation this goal should take priority over everything else because the federal courts pose the number one threat to our democratic process as long as we allow judges to legislate we do not have republican self government the current situation is intolerable the supremacists have replaced our three equal branches of the federal government with the imperial judiciary nobody called upon nine life tenured unelected unaccountable justices to solve the fundamental issues confronting us and to dictate our future history we call on congress to use its constitutional authority to restore the balance of power among the three branches

1140616 bacardi store i am very excited to lead the charge of the revitalization of the bay street business and tourist districts with such a high end offering with the clout of the bacardi store a truly unique retail destination we create a visitor experience that showcases the rich history heritage and passion of the bacardi spirits portfolio for both visitors and those who call nassau home
1140617 nassau and bay street have something very special as this themed retail outlet is the only branded retail outlet in the world designed solely for the sale of
1140618 bacardi would establish a retail store of this quality in nassau speaks volumes of their faith in the destination as a premier tourist attraction with the ability to produce solid business we value our partnership with bristol and for our part we are pulling out all the stops to revitalize our product to provide a high quality visitor experience overall
1140619 martin and i shared a commitment to help those in need of assistance throughout the world and im pleased to say that implementation of this agreement will make a truly meaningful difference to those who deserve it most

1140626 beginning oct 1 2008 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms will no longer reimburse hospitals for costs related to three infections acquired during a hospital stay catheter associated urinary tract infections utis catheter associated bloodstream infections and mediastinitis a deep infection following coronary artery bypass surgery on july 31 cms announced that surgical site infections following certain orthopedic procedures and bariatric surgery for obesity will also be added to the list of conditions for non payment we are pleased that cms took the comments of infection preventionists into consideration when drafting the new regulations apics 12 000 infection preventionists work daily to educate healthcare workers and lead performance improvement initiatives that save both lives and scarce healthcare dollars we appreciate that the agency based their decision to add new conditions on whether they could be considered reasonably preventable through application of evidence based guidelines
1140627 apic supports tying payment to conditions that have a high prevention rate and associated actionable evidence based prevention guidelines we stand ready to assist cms with a value based purchasing approach that recognizes not only the preventability of the condition but also the institutions track record in improving outcomes we favor a balanced approach for payment that recognizes institutions that are making progress in reducing infections rather than an all or nothing system based solely on non payment for infections deemed preventable and welcome continued discussions on this topic apic applauds cms for bringing much needed attention to the critical issue of hais the new regulations which will limit payment for preventable hospital acquired conditions have catapulted the issue of infection prevention into the limelight we hope that this increased attention will drive compliance with evidence based interventions to reduce these infections while not all infections are preventable working toward zero should be the goal apics targeting zero initiative encourages all healthcare institutions to set the goal of elimination of hais we look forward to continuing our partnerships with healthcare professionals policy makers insurers and patient advocacy groups to provide support and education in this important endeavor

1140660 wanneer bezoek je een mobiele nieuwssite bijvoorbeeld op het moment dat je in de trein zit en het nieuws wil checken dan wil je kort de meest actuele headlines of laatste updates met eventueel relevante afbeeldingen en videos zien en als je ergens meer over wil weten wil je ook direct duiding
1140661 zorg voor voldoende alineas en tussenkopjes zodat een tekst makkelijk te scannen is daarnaast geven kleine afbeeldingen tussen de tekst wat verstrooiing qua hyperlinks en verwijzingen naar andere media moet je opletten dat je niet naar iedere website kunt linken veel websites zijn namelijk minder of niet geschikt voor mobiele telefoons
1140662 de regels omtrent mobiele content gelden voor nu maar zullen met de ontwikkeling van de telefoons en data abonnementen ook mee moeten veranderen
1140663 we hebben nu erg vaak luchtig nieuws in die drie artikelen staan niet dat er helemaal geen luchtig nieuws op de mobiele website mag maar de eerste artikelen op de mobiele site mogen wat relevanter zijn dan op onze gewone site waar we ruimte hebben voor meer artikelen
1140664 voor de korte nieuwsberichten gebruiken we als basis teletekst voor de langere artikelen gebruiken we teksten van onze website de videoreportages zijn losse items uit het journaal die we hergebruiken of en hoe we uiteindelijk artikelen en reportages speciaal voor mobiel gaan bewerken of maken weet ik nog niet eerst willen we een groot onderzoek onder de gebruikers houden om te kijken wat aanslaat en wat niet
1140665 ik heb de wijsheid niet in pacht om te weten wat je op een mobiel wel en niet kunt doen ik denk dat niemand dat cht weet omdat er nog te weinig ervaring is opgedaan
1140666 een schaatswedstrijd is bijvoorbeeld goed te volgen maar wielrennen veel minder het scherm is bijvoorbeeld te klein voor een totaal shot je kunt de wielrenners dan slecht onderscheiden van gebruikers hoor ik ook dat ze de live stream die wij van de tour de france aanboden op hun mobiele telefoon vaak vooral gebruiken om het commentaar te horen
1140667 vergelijk het met het anp daar schrijven ze eerst een kop en versturen die die kop kun je zo smsen aissati naar ajax bijvoorbeeld daarna volgen teksten die steeds langer zijn en meer informatie bevatten n van de eerste en kortere takes zou je dan voor mobiel internet kunnen gebruiken de volgende voor de website en de langste bijvoorbeeld in de krant

1140670 dwight had gone on pilgrimages as a pastor and it was during his last three trips that he caught on that this is happening
1140671 while we were there we mostly listened to stories because that is what we felt we had to do
1140672 as a christian we have to be hopeful hopefully weve made progress in terms of solidarity and hopefully we can get americans to understand the situation
1140673 he told me he had immigrated to america when he was 4 years old and during a special report to the class he talked about what his life was like
1140674 in what he reported it clicked to me that i need to go see with my own eyes what was happening
1140675 its basically a prison in the west bank area we lived in you cant leave the area unless you have special privileges youre imprisoned in an environment with three cities with a wall surrounding it
1140676 if you want to go there to see with your own eyes whats happening you really arent in any danger doing that as an american
1140677 now is the time to go once you go there you will question everything you read and hear about the conflict in the mainstream media
1140678 they are people just like you and me who want freedom and peace

1140680 despite the origin of the funds these actions are completely illegal and violate every agreement signed between israel and palestine to date
1140681 the orphanages are located in area a palestinian territory under full jurisdiction of the palestinian authority into which the israeli government may not interfere
1140682 if i was born in america and my last name was jackson do you think they would do this to me
1140683 emphasizing the precarious and dangerous situation in the gaza strip u s citizens should avoid all travel to the area

1140685 why do you say hes irresponsible hes raised two daughter and hes had a happy marriage isnt he more mature in his lifestyle than you are
1140686 youre an ascetic guy you go to movie night and maybe have dinner with some pals i like you personally but you havent exactly grown up and had family and raised them and seen them off to college hes had a happy marriage isnt that a sign maturity that you havent demonstrated
1140687 probably because she is single her parents are no longer living shes an only child you need a very supportive family and supportive friends to have this job

1140689 the iphone has repositioned at amp t as the premier wireless brand in the world
1140690 were all about wireless were not betting on handsets were betting on jobs
1140691 because of technology challenges in the u s the only other carrier the iphone is compatible with is t mobile
1140692 the wireless technology is so radically different that apple would have to come up with an entirely new phone in order to have a product that would work on
1140693 you wouldnt even be getting the full 3g experience with t mobile
1140694 they needed someone high profile with engineering talent and certainly this guy fits the bill
1140695 the only downside is that he doesnt necessarily have any consumer products expertise
1140696 in terms of actual products hitting the street youre not going to see jhas impact before 2010
1140697 probably his biggest impact will be the level and type of engineering talent he will attract to the company over time
1140698 motorola will only be successful if this new team creates a complete solution that includes hardware software and services similar to apple
1140699 while the iphone is a great phone its real value comes from its software applications and services
1140700 although creating slick phones is one part of the success equation apples success will force even traditional handset makers to think harder about the software and services angle if they are to really compete with apple head on

1140716 in adult movies r rated movies monsters can signify many different things

1140725 its kittens and puppies as well all because we dont have the necessary laws and practices in place to impose a degree of responsible pet ownership

1140810 never marry but for love but see that thou lovest what is lovely he that minds a body and not a soul has not the better part of that relationship and will consequently lack the noblest comfort of a married life between a man and his wife nothing ought to rule but love as love ought to bring them together so it is the best way to keep them well together a husband and wife that love one another show their children that they should do so too others visibly lose their authority in their families by their contempt of one another and teach their children to be unnatural by their own examples let not enjoyment lessen but augment affection it being the basest of passions to like when we have not what we slight when we possess here it is we ought to search out our pleasure where the field is large and full of variety and of an enduring nature sickness poverty or disgrace being not able to shake it because it is not under the moving influences of worldly contingencies nothing can be more entire and without reserve nothing more zealous affectionate and sincere nothing more contented than such a couple nor greater temporal felicity than to be one of them

1140814 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small
1140815 and on the other side the risks are large and dramatic
1140816 we felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75
1140817 there is this idea that more is always better and if a test is available we should use it

1140839 we carefully reviewed the available evidence to measure the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer and could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease

1141035 wenn es ein schriftsteller im 20 jahrhundert vermochte ver nderungen in der gesellschaft oder in der ausrichtung von politik zu bewirken dann war es alexander solschenizyn
1141036 die isolation des autors unter der sowjetischen diktatur hatte wirkung gezeigt und selbst unter oppositionellen im lande blieb sein einfluss weitgehend auf die gemeinsame opfererfahrung begrenzt sicher setzte er mit dem dreib ndigen dokumentarroman archipel gulag stalins opfern ein literarisches denkmal aber die ersch tterung unter den westlichen intellektuellen und in den westeurop ischen kommunistischen parteien die das monumentale werk ausl ste machte der massenhaften kritiklosen begeisterung f r die kommunistische idee ein ende
1141037 dass solschenizyn w hrend seines exils das politische system des westens nicht als ideal pries hat nichts mit zunehmendem altersstarrsinn zu tun sondern mit seinen berzeugungen er lie sich von keinem system vereinnahmen
1141038 standhaft verfolgte er seine maxime nicht nach der l ge leben mit dieser aufrichtigkeit pr gte er das 20 jahrhundert als einer der ein leben nach der l ge schonungslos offen legte hier wie dort
1141039 das beispiel solschenizyns zeigt wie gro die macht des schriftstellers sein kann wenn er der bisher unterdr ckten der unbequemen wahrheit zum ausdruck verhilft
1141040 das eine vom anderen zu trennen bleibt die aufgabe des lesers der politisch wirkende schriftsteller im positiven sinne nimmt dem leser das denken nicht ab sondern regt es an die linie zwischen gut und b se verl uft nicht zwischen staaten klassen und parteien sondern quer durch jedes menschenherz mit diesem satz hat solschenizyn selbst den ma stab benannt er bleibt

1141061 oi my good heavens man what are you thinking loyola in the patriot league in all sports including a football team
1141062 were just trying to look at team designs financial considerations and see what problems other schools encountered in starting their programs
1141063 the patriot league is committed to being the ideal home for outstanding student athletes
1141064 these recommendations provide a higher level of consistency and clarity that strengthens not only the league but also the programs of every one of our member institutions
1141065 coaches always say that there are many people across the nation that are athletes but its hard to find kids that get it done in the classroom and also have leadership skills and work in the community to make it better
1141066 they really talk to me about that a lot the way i help in the community
1141067 were looking at the least number of buses we can provide to get all of our athletics where they need to go
1141068 we have great organizations who are doing great work and there are others we dont know about that are doing great work that will have to do greater work
1141069 we know we cant lock everybody up but we can prevent crime with proper resources and proper strategies
1141070 nowadays you dont see positive things going on about the youth you see all negative with the grant you can get more money and more kids doing positive things
1141071 when the mindset of the market has changed you kind of need more to support the trend
1141072 theres more room for the market to go down further evidence of easing demand and recovered supply from producers would trigger the downdraft
1141073 cra did not get us into this mess what got us into this mess is just bad bankers
1141074 there are a lot of banks out there with very good cra ratings that are very profitable because of good underwriting cra does not cause banks to fail its bad bankers who cause banks to fail

1141078 and while the mccain team is busy amusing themselves the fact is that the idea theyre attacking is supported by among others top mccain surrogate joe lieberman conference call host mike rogers governors charlie crist and arnold schwarzenegger the department of energy and nascar all of whom have urged americans to help save energy by minding tire pressure
1141079 but hey who ever let the facts or supporters positions get in the way of a political attack aboard the low road express thats no problem at all
1141080 last year yahoos board of directors and management took steps to thoroughly reexamine the companys direction and to improve the companys performance
1141081 since then yahoo has made significant strides in executing on its strategy performing particularly well in light of the challenging circumstances of the past six months
1141082 we are at a unique point in our history where we have the eyes of the world focused on our company and tracking our performance
1141083 this lookout point represents an investment of over 15 million dollars

1141087 i started out thinking that people might be interested in what a real estate professional has to say about buying and selling homes
1141088 now it seems that the audience is composed of people who want to tell real estate professionals what they know about buying and selling homes
1141089 after doing a bit of window shopping i thought that something seemed seriously out of whack with the local housing market so i started doing some research
1141090 as i found more and more information i figured i may as well put all this research online for other people with similar interests to find
1141091 im not speaking from the perspective of someone who has something to sell but rather just a guy that is taking in a ton of information and trying to process it all to make it easier for other people to get beyond the sales pitches and find out whats really going on
1141092 real estate agents never advise their clients to wait a few months to see what direction the market is going its not in the realtors economic interest to talk any buyer out of buying a house today
1141093 i think most real estate agents are about as sleazy as used car salesmen
1141094 the industry is always trying to paint the rosiest picture possible
1141095 i noticed that journalists writing about real estate were often writing as outsiders beyond perhaps owning their own home most had no direct experience in the field
1141096 as blogs became more popular it was troubling that many of the major real estate writers and bloggers werent actively employed in the business some of them didnt even own any real estate but seemed to have plenty of opinions on whether or not others should own it
1141097 i dont know what makes someone write about real estate when theyre not getting paid for it
1141098 i never thought that anyone would waste a second of their day to champion falling house values and celebrate when new and converted condos go unsold
1141099 if someone has a different viewpoint it often results in a healthy debate which results in more opinions and information for readers
1141100 a different dimension more depth and a balance to real estate blogging
1141101 the p i soundoff forums obviously have lots of name calling unproven information flat out lies speculation you name it im sure ive engaged in some of that behavior myself
1141102 as a whole the opportunity to respond directly to a news story and share opinions with the rest of the community is a great asset

1141113 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making

1141158 we cant completely insulate ourselves from events happening across the country but we can continue the fiscal responsibility and the targeted investments that have made us one of the healthiest states in the nation as we head toward 2009

1141160 even though were headed into what looks like less than calm revenue waters we are determined to go forward
1141161 they had cut state troopers and rolled back health care choices for our citizens they had refused to enact a rainy day fund to save for our future and they had spent every penny they had
1141162 we turned the ship of oregon around last session we funded education we doubled the money for oregon opportunity grants for higher education we added 139 state troopers we helped schools and small businesses by allowing them to pool together to buy health care we passed legislation to improve health care options for oregonians on many levels now we are ready to continue moving oregon toward a better future

1141224 any number i gave you now in fact would be wrong by the time i got back to the office
1141225 it appears the press conference was designed to suggest that all is well and that everything is ready and at this point the sheriffs office doesnt share that view
1141226 i think chief harrington has underestimated the ability of the anarchists to cause mayhem thats why the sheriffs office has been pushing for a target of 4 000 since last march but its also clear that even the 3 500 goal has not yet been reached

1141253 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1141254 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1141255 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the some straight talk
1141256 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1141350 either john mccain or barack obama will become the next president of the united states
1141351 as presumptive presidential nominees they already have tremendous power to influence the international community to do more to help end the genocide in darfur we are asking both candidates to act now to help bring peace to darfur since waiting until january 2009 will be too late for countless victims of this humanitarian crisis
1141352 the international community has failed darfur for over five years
1141353 on the eve of the summer olympics both john mccain and barack obama have an important opportunity by publicly supporting the senate resolution to use their influence to urge world leaders to embrace the olympic dream of world peace and help protect innocent darfurians
1141354 china is a permanent member of the u n security council and was acting president when the security council approved the unamid peacekeeping mission as such china has a special responsibility to ensure the full and rapid deployment of a fully equipped peacekeeping force in darfur moreover as current custodian of the universal values of peace and fraternity represented by the olympics china has a special duty to ensure that its actions are consistent with those values
1141355 with the world watching we must take advantage of the opportunity provided by the olympic games to recommit ourselves to ending the conflict in darfur and the wider region china in particular as the games host can make a strong statement by joining this call and showing support for the hundreds of thousands of innocent people still at risk in sudan and the region
1141356 the olympic truce like the games themselves is a sage legacy of our forbearers which raises humanity above hostility just as the ancient greek states sought safe passage for their athletes during the olympics the countries of the modern world must seek to protect the life and dignity of the people of darfur as we gather in beijing
1141357 this resolution is an important step towards achieving peace in darfur the olympics are a time when athletes come together in peace and solidarity and the olympic truce period is a time when the international community can come together in peace and solidarity with the u s behind the olympic truce we hope that more countries will join in the efforts to give the people of darfur a chance at lasting peace

1141382 it may have been a cult film but it did not really change the way women were portrayed in hindi cinema rather a film like zakhmi aurat where a woman was shown revenging herself can be considered to be a cult film he says
1141383 although aishwarya wants to go back to her lover her mangalsutra forces her to stay with her husband
1141384 for the first time a woman who is wronged decides to be on her own those lines still haunt me when pooja asks her husband if he would have accepted her if she had done the same and
1141385 there was a phase in the cinema of the 80s and 90s where a lot of the action and romantic films portrayed the woman as little more than the love interest of the hero but once multiplexes came in it gave us a chance to experiment even in my first film parineeta the heroine openly declares that she is married and is ready to live alone for me it was her inner strength that made her take that decision

1141459 i think no one believes me but i really feel like that would be a favor to the fans better to have wow that was great and what a satisfying ending rather than literally jumping sharks and bringing in raven simone to play the cute little adopted orphan and weddings in hawaii i feel buffy did it pretty well you know it ended and that was a great final episode never say never i guess but at this point jensen jared and my contracts are all up at year five and id rather just go out bold so thats my plan
1141460 beginnings are easy because youre launching everything endings are easy the middles kinda shitty and hard to write
1141461 i have mixed feelings about season three i think we had some great episodes but i feel it was probably my least favorite season i think thats because its the middle and its that weird transition point now pieces are falling back and momentum is starting to build again towards something so i think its actually been a real magnifying focus on our energy
1141462 i think weve got a exciting season in store were doing what we want to do and were doing it without compromise im excited for the fans they might say kripkes gone total bat shit and its terrible but im entertained by it its something i like and so well see if everyone else likes it and if not well go watch greys
1141463 chris you and tara both continue to inspire by your bravery strength and trust in openness
1141464 what a life world it is to be announcing a breakup so publicly with such an emotional impact on such a broad network that cares about you
1141465 she was french he was english they had just moved to london from paris when he found out about her affair she begged for a reconciliation he was more ruthless the same afternoon he filed for divorce in france one of the stingiest jurisdictions in europe for the non earning spouse and where adultery affects the courts ruling had she filed first in england her conduct would have been irrelevant and she would have had a good chance of a large share of the marital assets and even maintenance for life international divorce is full of such dramas and anomalies so the natural response of policymakers is to try to make things simpler and more predictable but the biggest attempt in recent years to do just that in a european agreement called rome iii has just been shelved instead several eu countries are now pressing ahead with their own harmonisation deal many wonder if it will work any better

1141475 afterwards the doctors and nurses didnt know if she would make a full recovery but shes just turned 2 and shes a normal happy baby now
1141476 it saved my daughters life and other babies should have the same chance
1141477 this machine is only being used on the tiniest earliest babies where there is nothing else that can be done
1141478 but if we had a machine that we could use much more freely then we would be able to deal with many more babies and have a much greater chance of saving lives

1141481 ive seen enormous improvements in the city and to the quality of life i think theres been dramatic improvements in all of the things that have been talked about in recent weeks i think the people of beijing deserve a great event
1141482 an absolutely extraordinary achievement the venues the scope the roads the transportation the drive in from the airport its all beautiful

1141484 for us the end of the games in beijing is the signal that were on the straightaway and the training time is almost over theres no doubt were going to be coming back home with a considerable new level of scrutiny and weight
1141485 it could be anything youre never quite sure how things will happen until people actually show up despite all the care and attention theres always a long list of things that come up every day
1141486 we want to see how they deal with those things on the spot
1141487 its a very complex operation so we want to observe that for sure
1141488 i think what were looking at this largest undertaking in human history in peacetime
1141489 just the amount of people that have to be moved the size of the venues just the scope of the undertaking
1141490 one of the things about attending an event like this is that it gives you a sense of whats possible and the kinds of things people are able to overcome a sense of what can be achieved i think that can be inspiring for us
1141491 typically we make an up to date report on all our infrastructure plans and now that something like this has occurred i will probably report on it in a little more detail

1141500 if a detainee were transferred to canada any decisions regarding the applicable legal proceedings that may be available in respect of the detainees conduct outside of canada would be dependent upon the nature of the evidence available and admissible in a canadian proceeding to determine if their sic was a reasonable prospect of conviction as well as an assessment as to the public interest in proceeding with a prosecution

1141514 it is not a secret that the west is creating a buffer zone around russia involving countries in central europe the caucasus the baltic states and ukraine
1141515 in response we may expand our military presence abroad including in cuba
1141516 in the absence of a clear positive response from iran we have no choice but to pursue other measures against iran
1141517 the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and the u n security council will only grow
1141518 there is one way for the iranians to make clear that they have found common ground its to come and say we accept the proposal this is a good basis for the beginnings for pre negotiations within a six week period and then we can suspend our enrichment and reprocessing and we can begin real negotiations and the united states will be at the table
1141519 while the peripheral canal is neither a finalized position recommendation by the delta vision blue ribbon task force nor a funded project governor schwarzenegger called for an environmental impact report earlier this year necessitating the land surveys
1141520 a little rebellion now and then is a good thing
1141521 how much fresh water is needed to restore and sustain the delta
1141522 one design suggestion for that canal would be a structure six football fields wide
1141523 because of the routes the peripheral canal would traverse well be negotiating easements
1141524 this despicable backroom deal undercuts one of the few remaining protections for water quality and fisheries in the delta
1141525 its a clear message that the state cares more about sending water to grow cotton in the desert than it cares about protecting delta agriculture and endangered species
1141526 the state board cant make up its mind whether or not it wants to enforce the law
1141527 but mr baggett clearly doesnt have the authority to waive the law by himself
1141528 aids is a very big dragon the mythological dragon was slain by saint george the original knight in shining armour but this dragon must be slain by millions and millions of foot soldiers

1141533 the location of the new studio is tbd but it will be in la to tap the enormous potential of designers
1141534 i want to bring an incredible sense of design to the market
1141535 we wanted everything to speak the language of gear to really get the product semantics

1141537 i have been very fortunate to have the opportunity to play basketball as a student athlete at ut martin and spend 35 years as a coach at ut knoxville
1141538 i appreciate every opportunity both schools have given me and hope this gift will afford other young women the same opportunities
1141539 pat is an amazing asset for the university of tennessee

1141548 even though you can cant be objective all the time there arent enough people trying to be
1141549 the next phase of internet content is someone standing up for objectivity
1141550 the more the tidal wave of opinion threatens to engulf us the more valuable it will be to have reporters and editors who just follow the facts where they might be
1141551 id hate to see a world where everything is an op ed page
1141552 people have opinions they have perspective one of the things that create expertise is your perspective
1141553 theres a distinction between total subjectivity and context that you can provide because you have experience and you speak with authority because of that experience i think journalists shy away from speaking with authority and that they ought to speak with it
1141554 sometimes journalism is objectified by other people correcting mistakes and errors

1141674 once upon a time in a faraway corner of the universe poured out and glistening in infinite solar systems there was a constellation on which clever animals invented knowledge it was the most arrogant and devious minute of world history but still only a minute after just a few breaths that nature took the constellation froze and the clever animals had to die someone could invent a fable of that sort and still not illustrate adequately how wretched how shadowy and volatile how purposeless and random human intellect appears within nature

1142047 the secretary of state said on friday the edf deal would have been a good fit
1142048 that remains our view and the parties are still in discussions

1142050 level of interest in nuclear new build in the uk from edf and from other operators remains high

1142053 we have discussed things with his agents and we are going to try and complete the move

1142055 im obviously disappointed to learn of this through the media reports
1142056 its not a setback hes over there and getting ready so its obviously all part of the plan
1142057 theres no doubt in my view hes still one year into a five year deal and i think that needs to be banged home pretty strongly
1142058 id like to think when the times are a little tough the sponsors are going to stick with us

1142081 it is important for industry to work in tandem with academia to unleash the immense power of parallel computing

1142083 to to kick start an industry wide effort to create and optimize software for the dozens hundreds and thousands of cores expected to power future computers
1142084 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china
1142085 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
1142086 some of the changes are easy to see the birds nest the main stadium and the water cube the swimming complex are already architectural landmarks
1142087 long after the games end these and other olympic venues will encourage the youth of china to participate in sport spectators will be inspired to become athletes and athletes will be inspired to achieve their best in world class venues
1142088 the venues are just a small part of the construction legacy that will benefit china after the games
1142089 new airport terminals new roads and highways new parks and a host of other projects that were initiated or accelerated because of the games will improve the quality of life and contribute to chinas economic development over the long term
1142090 many of the infrastructure investments and other steps taken as a result of the olympics will help china deal with environmental challenges
1142091 chinas role as our olympic host has opened a window to the worlds most populous nation
1142092 we have already seen the courage and determination of the chinese people in another context
1142093 the world mourned the staggering loss of life from the earthquake in sichuan province and marveled at the courageous response by the chinese people
1142094 starting this weekend and over the next 16 days the world will have another reason to come together to share common emotions
1142095 all of us in the olympic family hope that the beijing games will help the healing process in china and deepen the worlds knowledge of this remarkable country
1142096 i said at the outset that i believe these games will be historic
1142097 they are already a landmark event for the olympic movement
1142098 the mere fact that the olympic games are coming to china home to nearly 20 percent of the worlds population is significant
1142099 a billion television viewers are expected to watch live coverage of the opening ceremony on friday
1142100 the beijing games will significantly advance our goals of universality and fair play in several ways
1142101 we will see a record number of participating national teams 205 and a record number of women athletes about 45 percent of all the competitors
1142102 an unprecedented effort against doping with more stringent testing then ever before and new steps to combat irregular betting including closer co operation with law enforcement
1142103 the changes that are occurring in china are a microcosm of the changes in the rest of the world
1142104 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1142105 its not just a new face we need its new faces
1142106 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season
1142107 its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle etc
1142108 im hoping we will have some in before the start of the season
1142109 working with ian mcgeechan and shaun edwards and all of the coaching staff at wasps has been a fantastic experience for me
1142110 when ian spoke to me about the captaincy my first thought went to lawrence dallaglio
1142111 he is a great leader and an absolute legend of this game nobody will ever replace him and for me it has been a great honour to play both alongside him at wasps and against him in the international arena
1142112 raf has been an immense captain for france throughout his international career and one of the great players among the wasps squad throughout the last three seasons
1142113 the decision to appoint him as club captain was an easy one
1142114 this is where we prefer to compete to win on the water rather than in court

1142118 there is a difference between being broke and being poor to be broke is an economic condition and to be poor is a disabling frame of mind and a depressed condition of your spirit and we must vow never to be poor again

1142198 since todays press conference the collingwood football club has established that alan didak was in fact a passenger in heath shaws car on sunday night
1142199 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1142200 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held today
1142201 simply put alan has been put on notice as of today
1142202 that without pre empting the outcome it is very likely they a breach would have an immediate and ultimate outcome on the termination of alans contract alan is very clear from this meeting that it will be a turning point in his career in either direction clear lines have been drawn in the sand
1142203 right now the way im feeling is that if we played a game right now against st kilda and the st kilda boys roughed him up and were into him at the first bounce im not too sure if id be over there to support him to tell you the truth youve done it you cop it
1142204 i know once i get to saturday night were definitely all in it together
1142205 how should collingwood handle alan didak in light of the heath shaw affair
1142206 this crime was the action of one man who clearly must have lost the battle with his personal demons
1142207 when i was asked if the shooter would go to hell i replied that he must have been living in his own private hell for years
1142208 all the candidates on our side for various reasons are uninspiring or worse
1142209 i understand that its time for me to make my mark on defense

1142332 and the messenger muhammad will say o my lord verily my people deserted this quraan neither listened to it nor acted on its laws and orders
1142333 nobody sits with the quraan and leaves mutual he will either win or he will loose
1142334 and we send down from the quraan that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe in islamic monotheism and act on it and it increases the zaalimoon polytheists and wrong doers nothing but loss
1142335 the quraan is an intercessor whose intercession will be accepted and a disputant and credible adversary so whoever places it the quraan as its leader it will lead him to paradise and whoever places it behind his back it will lead him to the fire of hell
1142336 verily this quraan is either a reward for you or a burden upon you thus follow the quraan and not let the quraan follow you whoever follows the quraan it will make him to light upon the gardens of paradise and whosoever the quraan follows it will push or thrust him from behind until it casts him into the fire of hell
1142337 nobody enjoys it the quraan and benefits from it except the one who believes in it
1142338 nobody will enjoy the quraan its recitation and its understanding except the one who testifies that it is the words of allaah that he really spoke and revealed to his messenger sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam

1142341 whites stunning second crime novel to feature ex cop and ex pi jackson donne fulfills the promise of his debut
1142342 intricate plotting and nonstop action make this a nail biting read from start to finish white is a writer to watch
1142343 scenes of donnes mothers decline however are knowing and movingly written and the gritty new jersey locale seems an ideal setting for portraying the evil that men do
1142344 white has learned early the art of the hard boiled
1142345 white has created an appealing character in donne and the plot flies between the events in the 1940s and explosions kidnappings and murders in the present
1142346 an engrossing evocative debut novel that will grab most readers from its opening sentences fans of hard hitting uncompromising private investigators will hope that donne ditches his college dreams and continues to pound the pavement
1142347 white manages the neat trick of respecting the genres traditions while daring to nudge it toward something new and unexpected
1142348 a unique and artful blend of the pi novel and the police procedural with a story as deceptively simple as your first love and as fatal as your last car wreck a terrific novel
1142349 its the great american private eye novel reborn for the 21st century with a fast moving spare style that punches you in the gut at the same time it squeezes your heart

1142355 im not a happy person when im not running well
1142356 you try to look forward at things and hopefully you can say that 13 is reasonable
1142357 it was pretty cool growing up and watching him and those times when he was able to run well and get those marks and think of the unbelievable seasons that he was having watching him when i was a kid
1142358 if theres a shot for it that would be pretty cool
1142359 when the chase starts theres going to be a different race going on
1142360 theres not going to be the race of going out for wins and doing pit strategy things and stuff like that which will take your chance out of a good top 10 or a good top five you just have to be consistent and stay up there in order to get those finishes

1142377 take tadaaqah from them in order to purify them and sanctify them with it
1142378 and had it not been for the grace of allaah and his mercy on you not one of you would ever have been pure from sins
1142379 and if you are asked to go back then go back for it is purer for you
1142380 tell the believing men to lower their gaze and protect their private parts
1142381 indeed whoever purifies himself shall achieve success and remembers the name of his lord and prays
1142382 indeed he succeeds who purifies himself and indeed he fails who corrupts his self
1142383 but what could tell you that perchance he might become pure
1142384 and say to him i e firaun would you purify yourself and that i guide you to your lord so you should fear him
1142385 and woe to the polytheists those who do not give the zakah and are disbelievers in the hereafter
1142386 have you not seen those who claim purity for themselves nay but allaah purifies yuzakki whom he pleases
1142387 but it really looks like its a story that holds together
1142388 there are a number of possible explanations clinical trials may not detect all of the side effects that occur people enrolled in clinical trials may be less likely than those treated in the general community to experience serious side effects of chemotherapy clinical trials may not have enough power to detect rare side effects or our study could have overestimated the likelihood of experiencing serious side effects of chemotherapy because we used hospital bills rather than medical records to identify these events
1142389 hopefully women with breast cancer who hear about this study will understand that deciding whether or not to have chemotherapy must be made on an individual basis
1142390 women should talk with their doctors about both the benefits and risks of chemotherapy for women with small cancers the benefits may not outweigh the risks

1142452 just because you may be happy with your existing parking provider doesnt mean that youre getting the best possible rates keep in mind there may be more than one rate available such as individual rates or bulk rates for individuals bulk rates can be very difficult to obtain with our combined volume however we are able to pull together to get outstanding rates that benefit everyone
1142453 weve been building seo optimizing and marketing our domains as mini sites for a couple of years now i hate parking and most of you know this when we build a site we put custom written content on it and then do link building on the domain so that google and the other major search engines will feel it is relevant the end result is that the names get listed in the search engines and have rankings that continue to improve
1142454 what weve put together is a simple formula and an
1142455 i had researched rss mashups but just couldnt get on board with the idea of mixing all kinds of great content together an rss mashup would have buried the scope continuity and tone of the content contributors and valuable interesting content would get bumped off the list when new mashed content is updated i decided on rss feed aggregation a method by which targeted feeds are parsed pulling out the bits i need like the title the most recent ten posts and the first 200 characters and the root web address for the header

1142457 there are a number of possible explanations clinical trials may not detect all of the side effects that occur people enrolled in clinical trials may be less likely than those treated in the general community to experience serious side effects of chemotherapy clinical trials may not have enough power to detect rare side effects or our study could have overestimated the likelihood of experiencing serious side effects of chemotherapy because we used hospital bills rather than medical records to identify these events
1142458 hopefully women with breast cancer who hear about this study will understand that deciding whether or not to have chemotherapy must be made on an individual basis
1142459 women should talk with their doctors about both the benefits and risks of chemotherapy for women with small cancers the benefits may not outweigh the risks

1142464 he got his name on a lot of these publications because he was providing the spores
1142465 that is one of the reasons he was on so many publications so many of the studies were conducted with his spores
1142466 he was not a lone wolf kind of guy he liked to work with other people and solve technical problems
1142467 really critical in identifying better methods of spore production and in refining the qualities of these spore lots so they had consistent characteristics in terms of concentration and viability

1142575 usually our business peaks in the winter but today was another beast which we had never seen before shockingly 8 out of 10 customers were men and all of them asked if they could have a top shelf lit i told them we didnt serve alcohol and all hell broke loose i told them they could bring alcohol in if they would like but they kept telling me do me a favor dont do me any favors

1142596 it was the late 70s or early 80s when i first read solzhenitsyn and for the first time in my life i realized something was wrong about our life our country there were many people like me for whom he was sort of a guide
1142597 he was one of the first who raised his voice against the system against stalins regime and in defense of people who had fallen victims to it
1142598 his books one day in the life of ivan denisovich and gulag archipelago have helped people to see what this regime really was
1142599 the death of this great man and one of the 20th centurys major thinkers writers and humanists
1142600 is an irreparable loss for russia and for the world as a whole
1142601 entire thorny path of the writers life will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
1142602 his intransigence his ideal and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a hero from a novel an heir to dostoyevsky
1142603 he belongs to the pantheon of world history i pay homage to his memory
1142604 he just became ill in the evening when he had already gone to bed he wanted to die at home and he has died at home he lived a difficult but happy life

1142620 the browser of choice for most mac users apples safari has no phishing protection
1142621 mac users think that they dont need to worry about viruses and spyware
1142622 but e mail is the weak vector on the mac
1142623 this is the one area where the mac doesnt have an advantage in security
1142624 significantly fewer mac users were using anti phishing technologies but they were pretty much identical to windows users about giving personal information
1142625 windows user are used to being paranoid about not clicking
1142626 mac users arent even though they say anti virus software who needs it
1142627 it could be because theres less of it out there or more people could be using security software or better software
1142628 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1142629 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1142630 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1142631 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1142632 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains

1142637 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1142638 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1142639 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1142640 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1142641 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
1142642 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
1142643 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
1142644 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
1142645 weve got to have more troops on the ground and certainly we need to place more emphasis on afghanistan
1142646 at shows kids will approach me to my face and ask how ruck is doing i just respond with hes chillen

1142655 group of 10 yesterday outlined a possible 84 billion compromise bill including new
1142656 an a for effort but their proposal is unsatisfactory and needs many improvements
1142657 though there is not a lot of time maybe well see some vote on those bills or some version thereof
1142658 its a very difficult climate right now on capitol hill
1142659 you certainly cant say that there hasnt been an effort to move this thing
1142660 but there seems to be always something more important to fight about
1142661 this is my flagship issue energy independence and reducing our dependence on foreign oil
1142662 meus seios ficaram enormes n o estou conseguindo nem respirar direito

1142665 commissioner roger goodell today informed the green bay packers and minnesota vikings that he had completed his review of tampering charges filed by the packers against the vikings and found no violations of league policy
1142666 in his letter to the packers and vikings commissioner goodell said that while those involved acknowledged conversations between brett favre and vikings coaches none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1142667 we respect the commissioners decision and the thoroughness of the process we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1142668 bob hagan the teams public relations director showed me that article last night at 11 o clock i was in a personnel meeting with rick spielman and george paton until 11 o clock with the coaches so i have a pretty good idea how that went down you know you can shape the environment however you want one way or the other we havent had any contact with them
1142669 my comment would be i think thats the same journalist that wrote that there was a cell phone involved that the packers gave favre
1142670 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1142671 there are a few highway patrolmen around phoenix who know me pretty well
1142672 we knew we shouldnt expect to see something like that
1142673 the really cool thing is that all the details are still there
1142674 the existence of wet based glaciers proglacial lakes tundra vegetation and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the western olympus range was warmer and wetter that that of today
1142675 as it cools it crosses thresholds this is one when antarctica became permanently frozen and locked up
1142676 because if human beings are unfortunate enough to push climate over one of these thresholds it could be a total catastrophe
1142677 we knew we shouldnt expect to see something like that
1142678 the really cool thing is that all the details are still there
1142679 the existence of wet based glaciers proglacial lakes tundra vegetation and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the western olympus range was warmer and wetter that that of today
1142680 as it cools it crosses thresholds this is one when antarctica became permanently frozen and locked up
1142681 because if human beings are unfortunate enough to push climate over one of these thresholds it could be a total catastrophe
1142682 the realignment of cifas functions and resources into dia strengthens the close historical and operational relationship between counterintelligence and humint
1142683 integration under one organization will result in greater collaboration in operational and support areas where both disciplines overlap
1142684 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent
1142685 over time the percentage of people who have these conflicts will diminish
1142686 a lot of it will have to do with how much energy the fda is willing to expend to find people who dont have a conflict of interest
1142687 the fda has consistently used a very low standard for granting waivers and there is no evidence that this will change
1142688 by making the standard for waivers more stringent and improving the voting system the fda is moving closer toward ensuring the only interest taken into account during these advisory panels is that of the american people
1142689 simultaneous voting avoids voting momentum in which some voters may be influenced even subconsciously by the votes of those who precede them
1142690 the fact that sheen and petersen both happen to be on cbs is coincidental
1142691 theyre at the very top of their game and are the best at what they do youd expect them to be at the top of the scale
1142692 katie courics contract with cbs is legendary youd expect to see her there on the list
1142693 the goal of having no meca team members present was to prevent them from being asked any questions that could reveal information before nasa is ready to make an announcement sources say
1142694 the bush administrations presidential science advisors office however has been briefed on the new information that nasa hopes to release as early as mid august
1142695 not true meca results have not been discussed at the white house
1142696 there is no one who knows either on the phoenix project in tucson or at nasa hq who knows where this information came from
1142697 they had nothing new to report the story was about water ice
1142698 note the aviation week story said very very clearly three times or so no life on mars detected and phoenix can not detect life in the first place
1142699 we are attempting to assess the chemicals and minerals that make up the soil composition
1142700 we are now about half way through the process and there are several conflicting points of view this is not a good time to go public with half the story
1142701 i think what i do is really an advanced kind of literature
1142702 i create plots i invent characters but rather than keeping them trapped in a book i give them life launching them out into reality
1142703 that would be you i presume a friend of mine gave me your card
1142704 but do tell me my dear man who are your clients
1142705 ive had many names but i mean to forget them all id rather you were the one to baptize me
1142706 youre right im a photojournalist i collect images of wars of hunger and its ghosts of natural disasters and terrible misfortunes you can think of me as a witness
1142707 i dont do things like that i invent dreams for people im not a forger and besides if youll pardon my bluntness wouldnt it be a bit difficult to invent a completely african genealogy for you
1142708 no no im black pure black im a native cant you tell that im black
1142709 its a gecko yes but a very rare species see these stripes its a tiger gecko a shy creature we still know very little about them they were first discovered half a dozen years ago in namibia we think they can live for twenty years even longer perhaps they have this amazing laugh doesnt it sound like a human laugh
1142710 i soon learned that war is sometimes not a choice between good and bad but the choosing of the lesser of two evils
1142711 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent
1142712 over time the percentage of people who have these conflicts will diminish
1142713 a lot of it will have to do with how much energy the fda is willing to expend to find people who dont have a conflict of interest

1142716 simultaneous voting avoids voting momentum in which some voters may be influenced even subconsciously by the votes of those who precede them
1142717 would be outraged to know she was not given that right of first refusal
1142718 she is the only woman in history who has ever garnered this much support
1142719 she is the only woman in history who was able to raise the kind of money one would need to run a presidential campaign
1142720 is now seen as the reigning dean of the womens movement its sort of moses gets all the way to the mountain and doesnt get to the promised land and i think there would be people really angry about that
1142721 aids is a very big dragon the mythological dragon was slain by saint george the original knight in shining armour but this dragon must be slain by millions and millions of foot soldiers
1142722 we know there is so much yet to be done to expand prevention treatment and care to strengthen undeveloped health systems
1142723 we had a full house of course and on that particular day we had a large crowd i had expected a crowd because that young preacher was famous he was well known and people flocked to hear him as well as to see him

1142730 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1142731 the agenda for the language tends to be dominated by a small group of confident and very fluent welsh speakers who are untypical of the body of speakers as a whole their views are important but we must also ensure that we listen to those at the heart of the community those who use the language every day on the street
1142732 im not suggesting that the present thrust of government policy on the language is wrong far from it but we need to look more deeply at the situation of the language in the working class communities of wales those communities would see little benefit from the lco because most people wouldnt use a service in welsh they have little use for a daily newspaper in welsh because most of them wont read it
1142733 the first test of a vice president is whether he or she is qualified to serve in the top job should the occasion arise richardson clearly leads all other democratic contenders by that standard

1142758 twitters missed an opportunity any time a feature or count is turned off or degraded tell people youre removing clutter in their lives

1142769 will be a lot of stupidity over the nyer cover this week mostly based on remnick seeing it as art and critics treating it as journalism

1142775 in the last 15 minutes schwartzenegger has killed over 30 guys and there hasnt been a single line of dialogue
1142776 actually guys i think we need to revise the script a bit this whole bit where bennet for once second entertains he could last a second in the fight with the giant bodybuilder seems a bit off now we cast a fat short guy who seems to be making the whole villain relationship a bit more homoerotic than intended

1142784 the pullback in oil helped but when you strip away the backdrop were still faced with an anemic economy and tepid profits and im not sure theres a real compelling story to jump on the equity bandwagon
1142785 the credit crunch continues to bite and even for some of the more successful financial institutions it continues to take its toll
1142786 the bond market is taking its cue partly from what is happening in equities and also there is just a general realization that this downturn in economic growth has spread to other countries
1142787 could save up to 700 billion annually in health care spending by identifying treatments that do not produce the best medical outcomes
1142788 the boards 18 members would include representatives from three of the following entities private payers pharmaceutical device and technology companies patients and health care consumers physicians and agencies administering public health programs
1142789 answer the most pressing questions about what works in health care
1142790 we will work to move the bill this year but obviously time is very limited
1142791 it is important to start serious discussion on an issue important to consider in the context of health reform
1142792 we very much support this notion of a public private independent organization
1142793 a down payment on the agenda of most stakeholders which is to get all americans covered
1142794 promoting comparative effectiveness research we can improve quality value and expand coverage for all
1142795 a research agenda that targets the most costly types of treatments and produces findings that shrinks demand for those treatments may not sit well with individual drug device and medical professionals affected
1142796 supports the development and use of high quality evidence for health care decision making
1142797 and avoid denying or delaying patients access to beneficial care

1142810 when people increased their calorie intake after weight loss the bone remodeling markers did not respond and remained above what they were before weight loss
1142811 however unlike the weight loss phase it appeared that bone breakdown and bone formation were balanced rapid rates of bone remodeling regardless of the balance of breakdown and formation can increase bone fragility
1142812 from this study alone it is impossible to determine the consequences of accelerated bone remodeling during weight maintenance
1142813 because bone strength adapts to match skeletal load body weight is one of the strongest predictors of bone mass people planning on losing a significant amount of weight should consider incorporating high impact weight bearing physical activity into their exercise routine and consuming adequate calcium to improve bone health
1142814 a four year cycle is a bit of a surprise on the mechanism because it doesnt really have an astronomical function it has a cultural function

1142833 this is information from people working on the ground conducting detailed surveys
1142834 if it is indeed its own genus then it becomes even more important that we save it
1142835 what we decided to do was a little bit more time consuming actually try and count every individual
1142836 this exercise is part of an ongoing effort to train law enforcement and emergency medical personnel test equipment and enhance cooperation among agencies essential to ensuring public safety and protecting the campus community in the event of an emergency
1142837 it has to persist for six months or more in a way that interferes with your daily functioning

1142839 when the women came out of the scanner the complicated grief group rated themselves as feeling more negative than the others

1142841 i couldnt stand the pain nothing felt pleasurable to me i couldnt even listen to music
1142842 one got arrested for being on his porch because he was going to defy police and not go in the house and he felt he had the right to be on his porch my next door neighbor felt he had the right to be on his property with a drink and was told he couldnt be out front with a drink
1142843 and i had a few issues with complaints i was making and almost got charged with disorderly conduct because i was upset with some of the things going on like footballs hitting cars and people on my property who threw beers cans on my landscape
1142844 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1142845 a lot of people come just to get out of the heat
1142846 we are asking citizens and our visitors to pay attention to the weather and use their own judgment as to whether to ride out the storm on the island knowing there will be power outages during the night or tomorrow

1142853 la conducta y pol tica del shin bet ha convertido la vulnerabilidad de los pacientes en un medio primario para la obtenci n de informaci n
1142854 los largos tiempos de espera y los interrogatorios sobre la vida personal del paciente y sus conocidos contribuyen a una atm sfera dura en la que el paciente es consciente de que si se niega a responder podr an impedirle la salida de gaza para someterse a tratamientos necesarios
1142855 una vez que el shin bet controla al paciente la colaboraci n se convierte en condici n expl cita o impl cita para la concesi n del permiso para el tratamiento m dico

1142866 why arent there hordes of economists studying meaningful alternatives to market capitalism
1142867 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
1142868 mr trott claimed that mrs trott had slapped him across the face several times and threw a frozen lasagna at him that struck him at the top of his head
1142869 in my opinion it hurts very much and will cause welts its like throwing a block of ice and its very heavy
1142870 later during the investigation they discovered that mr trott had a violation of injunction he was also arrested
1142871 i dont know what is going on sales have gone mad
1142872 in the past two months we have gone from selling 300 pairs of tights a month to men in the u k to selling more than 1 000
1142873 german men have been wearing them for years more than 50 percent of german men wear tights including famous german football players i cant imagine many footballers here doing that
1142874 the failure of the plutonium fuel experiment is another major setback for the mox program and will further increase the already considerable cost overruns delays and risks
1142875 congress needs to pull the plug before even more taxpayer money is wasted
1142876 dizzywoods tree planting is a great example of how an adventurous storyline can cleverly weave a strong educational component into play
1142877 be an active and valuable member of that social networking community and dont smell like youre trying to sell something
1142878 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1142879 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1142880 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1142881 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1142882 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
1142883 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
1142884 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
1142885 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
1142886 when i stood there and looked at that packbot i realized that if that robot hadnt been there it would have been some kid

1142929 weve been able to take a wide range of material and weave it into a virtual tour that allows people to explore at their own pace
1142930 it represents a new communications medium for us and we have been fortunate to get the support of a lot of people that has enabled us to include some recognizable historic figures as part of this interactive commemoration
1142931 while we are only beginning to collect long term empirical data for the bladder there are early indications that the surgery is at least as good as open surgery at removing cancer

1142935 molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of human cognitive abilities
1142936 our new research suggests schizophrenia is a by product of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution our brains are unique among all species in their enormous metabolic demand if we can explain how our brains sustain such a tremendous metabolic flow we will have a much better chance to understand how the brain works and why it sometimes breaks
1142937 were seeing that abortion not only ends the life of a child it also endangers the life of that childs future siblings
1142938 infant mortality statistics from the 2005 period linked birth infant death data set
1142939 american life league will continue to work to make women aware of abortions ripple effect
1142940 not only does abortion hurt women preborn babies and their families but it could also risk the life of future children abortion leads to death not only for the preborn child killed by abortion but also for the many children susceptible to preterm birth and infant death
1142941 that does make the plant more attractive and more efficient yes
1142942 what id like to do is be able to say that inbev has pledged to keep the benefits keep the employees and go right ahead with it if they dont well cross that bridge when we come to it i think thats the best way i could put it right now
1142943 i dont think that that would be in their best interest
1142944 there are an awful lot of budweiser drinkers a lot of teamsters out there that also drink budweiser i think that that would be a big mistake for them
1142945 the fact that there are 16 000 people a year more each year who are infected than we had been previously been told is disturbing
1142946 we know there are a significant number of people here in the community who are at high risk through substance use sharing of intravenous drug equipment and risky sexual behavior who may be infected and dont know their status
1142947 you could go to a couple of different places and be tested and no one would know that as those numbers are reported they represent duplications
1142948 new york state continues to be the state in the united states with the highest incidents of hiv with the highest numbers of hiv infection with the most people living with hiv with the most people living with aids

1142951 as a close knit group here you know today we can lean on each other probably more than what we normally do but we just have a great group of people here
1142952 i think the north side has more violence the south side is gun happy
1142953 i think when it comes to the north side the numbers are a little bit higher on the north side then some of the other neighborhoods
1142954 no i wouldnt feel safe walking the streets at night on the north side not at all not anymore anyway
1142955 the north side does not have at least were not experiencing now the shots fired that the south side has
1142956 so i believe that its people calling in thats bringing those numbers up a little bit
1142957 communities across the state face increasingly tough economic times and binghamton is no different
1142958 i called in my department heads and i sent every budget page back to them i told them to cut spending 5 percent across the board this will be a difficult task but it is necessary to minimize tax increases i am also putting a hold on all hiring effective immediately

1142962 it wasnt so long ago that global warmists were acting as if their alarming forecasts had already come true even likening skeptics to holocaust deniers now they are reduced to saying we really dont know if global warmism is true or not but since the consequences are so dire if it is wed better just assume that it is and act accordingly
1142963 its true that scientists dont know exactly how much world temperatures will rise if we persist with business as usual but that uncertainty is actually what makes action so urgent while theres a chance that well act against global warming only to find that the danger was overstated theres also a chance that well fail to act only to find that the results of inaction were catastrophic which risk would you rather run
1142964 by raising the specter of catastrophic consequences he evades the question of just how probable those results are
1142965 one difference between pascals wager and krugmans is that whereas pascal was making a case for individuals to embrace faith krugman is arguing for collective action which is to say he wishes to use the power of government to impose his beliefs on others
1142966 by imploring political leaders to make a bet on speculative predictions of catastrophe krugman has made an important concession that current scientific knowledge is insufficient to justify the
1142967 most recently he was named the 2007 emerging executive of the year by the utah technology council at age 24 he was recognized by utah business magazine as one of the top 40 under 40 business professionals in utah in addition he joined an elite group of venture entrepreneurs when his peers selected him to vspring capitals v100 list

1142978 sometimes when a speaker has the audience on the edge of their seats theyre trying to muster up the nerve to get up and go home
1142979 we can only treat badly those things or people whose souls we disregard
1142980 mr obama awoke in st petersburg fla ready to talk about an ailing economy and saw this newspaper headline it s a recession the mojo should feel good
1142981 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks and planting doubts about people
1142982 the other person is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks and planting doubts about me
1142983 at which point he offers a coda more wish as analysis
1142984 the gop tries to paint me as some laugable combination of paris hilton and moses because they have nothing factual to attack with and nothing realistic in support of them
1142985 and what was being talked about was paris and britney
1142986 i will also never vote for a black man who acts as if anyone who disagrees with him is a racist am i the only white person in this country who is sick of this crap
1142987 am i the only white person in this country who is sick of this crap
1142988 hes arrogant good looking enjoys a good workout and doesnt prefer junk food
1142989 the obama campaign is simply a minstrel show with former clinton backers now clinton haters behind the mask obama is revealing that he is nothing more than a dark face painted on a white socialist agenda
1142990 the republicans were good at attacks and distractions what they are not so good at is governing
1142991 even as recently as this morning when bill clinton was interviewed on his african trip by kate snow the clintons still have the knives out when asked by kate about sen obama s ability to be president he danced around the issue in true bill fashion never really answering the question another old man who is jealous and envious of not only youth but superior judgement
1142992 if your answer is yes the repugs have a candidate for you c student angry boring out of touch old and liable to get sick at any time
1142993 only one question that the news media needs to ask is the usa ready to elect a black man president of the united states posted by fred d
1142994 republicans would define mr obama much as they did senator john kerry in 2004 an elitist out of touch with ordinary americans
1142995 obama is egotistical obama is a coward obama is white in black face
1142996 bam obama has created shallow sensationalism he is shallow sensationalism
1142997 im shocked shocked that there is gambling going on in here
1142998 two slightly hallucinogenic attack commercials by senator john mccain had caught the popular eye
1142999 did you think g w bush was qualified and ready to be president in the fall of 2000 i dont think anyone can see him answering this question honestly
1143000 i am not going to be scared guilted educated or influenced in any other way to change my vote between now and then
1143001 i m tired of hearing bush mccain that s a load of bull and it s an insult to my intelligence for obama mccaskill amp co to keep repeating it
1143002 yes the surge has helped reduce violence in iraq but our continued occupation costs the us 150 billion per year or 500 per person how many americans would vote to have their taxes raised 500 per person per person not per family to help improve the situation in iraq
1143003 obama is just another politician re packaged for a youth market he actually makes mccain look better simply because mccain s not trying to put himself out there as a messiah and therefore ironically comes across to many americans as more truthful
1143004 clobbering mccain among working class voters those earning under 30 000 a year by 58 28 i wouldnt take much comfort from this if i were an obama supporter given that the 2004 democratic candidate for president john kerry won a similar demograph by 63 37 and still lost the election
1143005 two slightly hallucinogenic attack commercials by senator john mccain had caught the popular eye
1143006 y all it is a little early to be calling the race don t you think two vp picks two conventions and a whole series of debates to go people i m not really surprised that mccain s running these ads it s his heritage but he almost brought them out too soon can t continue to make front page news with ads like this if you re running them every week
1143007 well i have a year to give them a gift
1143008 the energy on stage the energy in the audience everything was 10 plus the fans walked away hopefully feeling they got a truly entertaining show that was worth waiting for

1143010 and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
1143011 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish i had said things i wish i hadnt said
1143012 but i am not a racist i never made a racist comment and i didnt attack barack obama personally
1143013 i think everybodys got a right to run for president to qualify as under the constitution and i would be the last person to ever begrudge anybody their ambition
1143014 when the mindset of the market has changed you kind of need more to support the trend
1143015 theres more room for the market to go down further evidence of easing demand and recovered supply from producers would trigger the downdraft
1143016 listen up everyone tom yorke just earfucked the shit out of me
1143017 connected gated communities and office parks are key markets offering great growth potential which forms an integral part of the overall growth strategy of vodacom south africa internet solutions exited isgs but the founding members will still stay involved in the new company
1143018 gated communities is an important niche market and we will continue to provide data and voice services to end users through our extensive partner channel
1143019 at this stage it makes more sense to continue investing in our core network where we have seen increased demand for our vois and broadband services
1143020 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1143021 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1143022 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed

1143029 an officer responded and spoke to loss prevention and then issued a citation for theft under 500
1143030 i put it in the top and then hook it and it would be possible that i could put something into it without knowing like that
1143031 i think a thief is a thief if youre going to steal something it dont matter who you are its wrong

1143033 there wasnt much threat to the buildings around here they just wanted to shut down the street as a precaution and did evacuate a nearby daycare as a precaution but because the leak is low volume they didnt expect it to cause much of a threat

1143158 hundreds perhaps even thousands of scholars commentators lawyers and politicians who have analyzed european unions problem
1143159 a regime can be defined as democratic if the people as a collectivity have the formal power and a number of sufficiently means through which to authorize the basic process of legislation
1143160 transnational actors can play a leading role in agenda setting at all levels of domestic transgovernmental and european politics and policy making
1143161 rely on them for the vision thing because transnational non state actors
1143162 detached from the demands of day today politics do not depend on electoral support are not under constant media scrutiny and can often invest more resources into thinking about future
1143163 they are a source of support of its role in drafting legislation they are a means of testing out proposals among stakeholders and the ways these are likely to be received in different national settings ahead of the council of ministers they seek out points of view about them and for the commissions role as guardian of the treaties they collate information about the implementation of measures and their impact
1143164 the professions are the most weakly organised actors at the eu level
1143165 both sub national regional and local interest representation at the european level
1143166 the provision of the single european act and the treaty on european union
1143167 different actors mobilize in different ways in response to different policy initiatives or predicaments
1143168 as a strategy for tackling the democratic deficit attention is increasingly shifting towards the europeanization of civil society
1143169 civil societys return to the center of political discourse has been viewed by liberal political theorist as the means to elaborate a legitimate state structure by limiting its scope and by encouraging or facilitating political engagement by and mutual solidarity between otherwise alienated individuals
1143170 traditional neo functionalist explanations which place the relationship between supranational institutions and organized interests at the center of the european union
1143171 involvement of such actors would be a key catalyst in deepening and expanding the unions powers
1143172 could affect public policy and thereby gain a stake in the preservation of both the outputs and system of the union
1143173 civil society acts as a mediator between the citizen and the state
1143174 act as a filter for various national interests in certain sectors
1143175 monitor and assess the performance of political and economic players and respond to their action or inaction
1143176 contribution to the legitimacy of the union has thus largely been through helping to produce more broadly acceptable policy outcomes
1143177 schools for democracy that socialize citizens as political beings and contribute to the formation of a general will out of the specific concerns of groups
1143178 ngos often claim to work in alternative ways which socialize and empowers those they serve
1143179 purpose policies and actions of the european union global policy forum 2001
1143180 that a wider range of political activists is aware of eu issues and is attempting to raise broader societal concerns at the eu level than in the past
1143181 promoted the idea of a civil dialogue in parallel with the social dialogue which was at that time beginning to produce its first tangible results
1143182 a part of the solution to the notorious democratic deficit
1143183 has seen the civil society as both the defeat of big government and a means of bringing the citizens back
1143184 the weakness of political parties at eu level has created an advocacy void that ngos are well situated to fill warleigh 2006 p
1143185 their influence depends on how well they succeed in making a privileged framework for discussion and a center for networking
1143186 makes them credible advocates of engagement with the european union
1143187 channels to popular opinion and or concern which they prioritize more highly than representation from industry
1143188 the natural ally of social actors not necessarily because they favour their demands but because their interests match
1143189 meps and interest groups share an interest in building up their strength and therefore in giving each other support as numerous case studies about consumer protection environmental policies and animal protection illustrate
1143190 act as agents of political socialisation with particular reference to eu decision making and policy
1143191 must be substantively rather than formally democratic that is they must not only have structures which allow supporters to participate in their decision making but their supporters should actively play such a role
1143192 some members of social policy interest groups fear that the support given by eu institutions is little more than a convenient way for eu to give a human face to the single market
1143193 sees an emerging civil society from the development of the eu public interest agenda
1143194 an elite isolated segment whose self contained dialogue with the commission does little to enable it to reach out civil society while the last
1143195 their supporters to play a role in the formation of ngo policy on issues to be tackled in the eu level
1143196 ngos must be able to call their own tune rather than answer to the priorities of their funders
1143197 the socialization will be stillborn with insufficient outlets for the newly raised levels of awareness
1143198 twin strategy in which ngos can reform and play a part
1143199 the partnership principle must be exported in all areas of eu activity
1143200 the broad attempt to engage the public and initiate further institutional reform based on sustained public dialogue

1143206 collaborate with light green interests groups if there is an agreement of interests
1143207 sit on the general advisory forum on the environment and sustainable development
1143208 establishment of a structured dialogue between organised civil society and the different levels of government
1143209 achieved an ep amendment about pesticide limits which the commission accepted despite the opinions of its own scientific adviser warleigh 2002 cited by greenwood 2003 p
1143210 helped to shape not only the thinking of policy actors such as the commission and producer groups but also member states preferences towards environmental protection policies
1143211 democracy in the european union should not only concern government by the people but also government of the people or government with the people through contact interaction with organized interests
1143212 reform must be started now so that people see changes before further modification of the eu treaties

1143301 ik verwacht niet dat de zorg daardoor duurder wordt ziekenhuizen moeten onderling concurreren om de gunst van de pati nt dus zullen ze effici nter en meer klantgericht moeten gaan werken
1143302 die trend van meer specialisatie zal zich uitbreiden door te specialiseren onderscheiden ziekenhuizen zich van de concurrentie

1143345 the new zealand team that we have now is the best weve had in a long time
1143346 were very attacking minded now and we look to go forward
1143347 we are still a young team but were a passionate team as well and we want to play well this the games is probably bigger for us than the world cup at the moment
1143348 the canadians are all fulltime professionals so that result would be like a new zealand mens team drawing with a team like italy or france
1143349 it shows the belief in this team we dont need any other motivation like proving people wrong
1143350 im confident we could replace ali the strength of this team is the cohesiveness
1143351 theyre a relaxed group of sisters on the pitch who would die for each other you cant single out any player theyve all got gifts but the thing weve asked for at this event is to push some personal bests out
1143352 we ask cambodia to move their soldiers who are near the ta muen thom temple
1143353 we are very pleased with how fast our costa rican operation came on line and the increased flexibility it offers all of our clients
1143354 we have seen a paradigm shift in marketing this year with business development and how our reputation has preceded us in a dynamic way changing the way we approach potential clients and how they reach out to us
1143355 i was very psyched about that i was showing someone that today and bragging to them endlessly
1143356 we were just looking at old photos of it he pretty much looks the same
1143357 maybe has a little bit more of a beard but i think he probably could have grown a full beard when he was about fifteen so he is pretty much the same both mentality and physically just a great guy and sexy as hell
1143358 i thought he was amazing when i first went to the table read and like saw him do his deal on it
1143359 i was just so surprised that james had that in him it was amazing he was so watchable its just so funny i can watch him watch 227 for years
1143360 originally seth was going to play the more stoned character but we switched so he can play the slightly less stoned character there isnt that big a difference anyway
1143361 i did not go with a burning desire to be at the olympics again
1143362 it was a good excuse to go back to england again and see old friends it was a journey on all sorts of levels
1143363 but at the end of the day this was all right because at least nobody can say i had special treatment
1143364 i was relieved that everything went so well when i set a plan i want to get there i am quite competitive
1143365 saumur was like being at the olympics already i thought what if i jump the wrong fence ride outside the flags all sorts of things

1143369 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
1143370 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
1143371 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
1143372 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin

1143377 you have the feeling of belonging to a wider family which is pretty bloody supportive
1143378 the need to give people taps on the shoulder i dont think its going to happen people have such respect for the support thats there in the team that you wouldnt do that to your other team mates
1143379 he would speak fondly about the news production process how the team used to work day and night putting in the hard work to get the correct information out to the public
1143380 it is very useful for information officers to know what the public wants or feels
1143381 you have more media to oversee especially about controversial issues like price hikes erp charges
1143382 reflects the increasing importance the government places on information management
1143383 the voice of the government in helping to quell rumours dispel fears rally the people and maintain confidence and trust
1143384 this is especially important in todays new media landscape which has changed the way we communicate with our various audiences

1143402 while most militaries are not specifically equipped or trained to deal with non traditional threats militaries are often the only organisations able to respond to them rapidly and on the scale that is required
1143403 these know no borders and respect no boundaries they affect us all and they can be addressed cooperatively by us all
1143404 in our increasingly interconnected world threats can come from 360 degrees from unexpected sources and directions
1143405 the us acknowledges chinas place in the world thats not denying the competitive aspects to the relationship but it is a broader template which coincides with the building of the new embassy

1143407 because if you are not raising a lot of money do you need to be put through such a rigorous process a lot of small charities face a very big burden
1143408 you dont want make setting up a charity so expensive and add to the burden of entering the sector
1143409 if you dont have money for an audit then you will need to accept a trade off in the degree of governance
1143410 its a whole gamut of regulations such as the charity code other checks and balances that will add to more transparency
1143411 but by reporting a little more you also protect the charity and yourself
1143412 we do believe this was the last stronghold in gaza
1143413 when a man stands between two choices to be killed by his people or to be arrested by his enemy and he reaches a conclusion that it is better to be arrested by his enemy it shows you how cruel the situation is in gaza

1143446 its not about overcharging im an ignorant lawyer im a family lawyer who rarely did conveyancing deals
1143447 this court takes a serious view of overcharging lawyers should take care of their clients fairly
1143448 the blogs were a bit out of control were very mindful of the media coverage and blogs in controlling misinformation all i can say is were going to continue to stay on top of it the misinformation that came out over the weekend fed a lot of depositors fears
1143449 i think its going to be months that were working our way through this period clearly months but again its a safe banking system a sound banking system our regulators are on top of it this is a very manageable situation
1143450 access to capital and credit is essential to growth if that access is restrained or blocked the economic system takes a hit
1143451 the exact words were were saying no to almost everybody
1143452 this is why god made banks for this kind of transaction this is going to slow down the american economy
1143453 before they wouldnt verify income and they were loose on the valuations of collateral

1143457 god is smiling on this factory were at such an exciting inflection point and this is what a bank is supposed to do theres sand in the gears

1143462 bring the revolution in outsourcing and branding that he had been part of in the corporate world into the heart of the u s military
1143463 our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime
1143464 or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii and korea we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
1143465 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
1143466 the expansion of private i e mainly corporate power and the selective abdication of governmental responsibility for the well being of the citizenry
1143467 the privatization of public services and functions manifests the steady evolution of corporate power into a political form into an integral even dominant partner with the state it marks the transformation of american politics and its political culture from a system in which democratic practices and values were if not defining at least major contributory elements to one where the remaining democratic elements of the state and its populist programs are being systematically dismantled
1143468 in 2006 the cost of americas spying and surveillance activities outsourced to contractors reached 42 billion or about 70 percent of the estimated 60 billion the government spends each year on foreign and domestic intelligence the number of contract employees now exceeds the cias full time workforce of 17 500 contractors make up more than half the workforce of the cias national clandestine service formerly the directorate of operations which conducts covert operations and recruits spies abroad
1143469 the separate bookkeeping and accountability devised for blackwater dyncorp triple canopy and similar outfits was part of a careful displacement of oversight from congress to the vice president and the stewards of his policies in various departments and agencies to have much of the work parceled out to private companies who are unaccountable to army rules or military justice meant among its other advantages that the cost of the war could be concealed beyond all detection
1143470 bill clinton picked up the cudgel where the conservative ronald reagan left off and took it deep into services once considered inherently governmental including high risk military operations and intelligence functions once reserved only for government agencies by the end of clintons first term more than 100 000 pentagon jobs had been transferred to companies in the private sector among them thousands of jobs in intelligence by the end of his second term in 2001 the administration had cut 360 000 jobs from the federal payroll and the government was spending 44 percent more on contractors than it had in 1993
1143471 outsourcing as a virtual joint venture between house majority leader newt gingrich and clinton
1143472 boldest privatization agenda put forth by any president to date
1143473 a neoconservative drive to siphon u s spending on defense national security and social programs to large corporations friendly to the bush administration
1143474 every purchase you make with a credit card every magazine subscription you buy and medical prescription you fill every web site you visit and every e mail you send or receive every bank deposit you make every trip you book and every event you attend all these transactions and communications will go into what the defense department describes as a virtual centralized grand database

1143486 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
1143487 this is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time

1143491 enthusiastic about the asean 3 but when the eas came it was a little bit of a diversion
1143492 you cannot dismiss one but at the same time you also cannot repeat everything in the two organisations one kind of cooperation in two institutions that has really taken china particularly aback
1143493 my take on this is that it is unnecessary for us at this stage to choose between asean plus three and the east asia summit let the future decide whether the two will remain separate but intersecting circles or whether they would become united
1143494 each grouping has its own history and its own raison detre we should nurture both the asean 3 and east asia summit processes

1143718 get busy superds look at the fiasco the dnc is pushing on us choose the grown up already
1143719 ptima hasta diciembre cuando ganamos el mundial de clubes y anteriormente la supercopa de europa despu s hemos bajado mucho el rendimiento y tambi n el f sico demasiado
1143720 exacto y no debe volver a ocurrir nos concentraremos y lucharemos por el scudetto sta es nuestra prioridad
1143721 no exageremos hubiera sido mejor haber entrado en la champions pero felicitamos a la fiorentina por su buen trabajo y necesitamos volver a unirnos todos para iniciar otro ciclo ganador en estos a os hemos traido diversas copas a casa o acaso lo ha olvidado
1143722 son varios los factores que han influido sobre todo los equipos cerrados en san siro hemos encontrado diversos obst culos es por esto que debemos mejorar
1143723 uno de los cuatro todos son perfectos una primera punta con las caracter sticas para resolver nuestros problemas necesitamos delanteros que nos ayuden tambi n en la fase defensiva
1143724 es un grand simo campe n y el milan siempre est detr s de grandes campeones pero si finalmente llega no ser por una petici n m a
1143725 vamos a la uefa la ganamos y despu s llevamos a casa dos champions league seguidas
1143726 lo confirmo el objetivo es conquistar el scudetto para entrar en la champions y volver a levantar de nuevo ese trofeo
1143727 las energ as que us bamos en europa ahora estar n en italia
1143728 heridos no pero estamos decepcionados no creemos que la distancia refleje las diferencias entre los dos equipos y vamos a reducirlos o mejor dicho a superarlos
1143729 quien lo gana se lo merece siempre felicidades al inter
1143730 ha jugado realmente bien pero en la ltima jornada era complicado que las cosas hubieran cambiado pero a pesar de todo se merecen los aplausos de todos
1143731 ser as porque algunos dejar n de jugar y hace falta recambios pero no es una revoluci n la base es s lida y sobre ella construiremos el milan del futuro
1143732 seguiremos adelante con el nuestro basado en la posesi n del bal n pero buscaremos algunas variaciones pienso por ejemplo en el 4 4 2
1143733 pato es nuestro futuro en 5 meses donde ha tenido dos lesiones ha marcado 9 goles a partir de l se comienza
1143734 gran centrocampista donde es capaz de cubrir todos los puestos en la fase defensiva ha sido un fichaje realmente acertado
1143735 nostalgia pensando en las emociones de atenas 2007 hemos dado el m ximo pero contra el arsenal est bamos en fase de emergencia y no pod amos dar m s de s pero lo volveremos a intentar la champions es la casa del milan y lo conseguiremos
1143736 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
1143737 62 of chief academic officers believe that online learning is equal to or superior to classroom learning
1143738 dengan cara ini setiap orang hanya bisa melihat alamat e mailnya sendiri
1143739 its revolutionary in that it is different from conventional gpu graphics processing unit architectures but evolutionary in that it uses existing i e x86 technology
1143740 new approach to the software rendering 3 d pipeline a many core programming model and performance analysis for several applications
1143741 we have a lot of people trying to position different processing architectures youve got nvidia trying to position the gpu with cuda compute unified device architecture which is basically a programming structure to use it as an accelerator as a general purpose cpu central processing unit or whatever
1143742 basically what intel is doing is trying to leverage the x86 architecture in a way that it has not been leveraged before as really kind of a head end core to a high end processing element that can be used as a server accelerator as a graphics accelerator
1143743 any application that can use a simd single instruction multiple data processor 3d graphics scientific computing etc
1143744 it will be easier for people to program applications for larrabee thats the value of larrabee theyre going after the ultra high end stuff thats going to be doing scientific simulations and stuff like that theyre really cranking the power up to see what they can do and then theyll scale it back to see how it can fit into pcs
1143745 the blind can function adequately using credit cards or electronic scanners that identify different bills and by relying on help from others
1143746 the secretarys argument is analogous to contending that merely because the mobility impaired may be able either to rely on the assistance of strangers or to crawl on all fours in navigating architectural obstacles they are not denied meaningful access to public buildings
1143747 new orders from the major markets of the united states and europe declined but regional markets especially china and india provided the business volume for the overall orders index to hit above the 50 point threshold level
1143748 clearly theres a huge appetite for premier league football all over the world
1143749 weve got to concentrate on making sure our competition is as vibrant as possible in regard to any increase in international exposure of the league the clubs have charged the executive with examining all options
1143750 what im most grateful for is that im going to be walking into the olympics opening ceremony with my siblings
1143751 in 2000 and 2004 i told them about my experiences there but on friday ill walk through that experience along with them
1143752 its kind of like a corporate structure mums ondina the chairman dads julio the chief executive officer and im the manager
1143753 we have a huge advantage as we are a family of team mates
1143754 it seems almost unfair to our opponents as when they come up against one of us its actually the four of us against them
1143755 were one of the most competitive families i know of especially when we play soccer
1143756 were horrible at it but if you were watching us the intensity is like a world cup final
1143757 diana always wants to beat us in anything whether its video games or poker she beats me at poker occasionally and in volleyball and maybe thats why she loves the sport so much
1143758 ive been with the team for the past two years so its not something i think about all the time
1143759 its only when the media or others ask about what makes them so special that i stop to think about it and im actually taken aback by them
1143760 there could be some amazing genetics involved but they also work very hard at it
1143761 ian thorpe intends to pursue the legalproceedings for defamation that he has commenced in the court against french newspaper lequipe and a journalist from that newspaper damien ressiot
1143762 i tried to contact them everyday for a week through email and called them but the line was disconnected
1143763 when i couldnt get through i was alarmed and contacted the travel agent who checked and told me about the scam i checked the internet and found out about it as well
1143764 we were disappointed as its our dream to see our child compete at the olympics we didnt tell lynette about it as she doesnt need to know this
1143765 i did checks on the company and talked to them to ask how they got the tickets
1143766 they gave me this wonderful story about how they bought the tickets off sponsors and i just fell for it i feel like an idiot
1143767 the olympics are beautiful and this is the first time i can participate
1143768 i was shot at here by a sniper in this stadium and i wasnt killed because thank god i happened to be running
1143769 there were several assassination attempts on our way home car bombs and explosions
1143770 it was her insistence that pushed me to continue working with her
1143771 samsung has done it with lcd tvs so why cant we do it with mobile phones
1143772 we cannot be number one if we continue to stick to high end categories weve segmented the market into six groups to cover the whole population to introduce the right product for their needs and tastes
1143773 we would see a lot of opportunities come up in the next two three years opportunities we would have eschewed because theyre just too expensive
1143774 until now we did not receive any indication or any request for cancellations
1143775 people are panicking because of the korean shipyards it does not mean that there are cancellations at cosco
1143776 rising steel prices and labour costs are still a challenge
1143777 m1 is repositioning itself for the future as it develops new businesses anchored on our core competencies
1143778 the launch of m1 fixed broadband is an important step in our planned transformation from a single play mobile operator to a dynamic multi play operator with interests in the mobile and fixed sectors
1143779 the existing players like starhub and singtel have already cemented their own market share
1143780 the pricing is relatively similar so it would be hard to penetrate starhub market share
1143781 the proliferation of the internet and the increasing demand for internet bandwidth also make this an opportune entry into the fixed broadband market
1143782 our subscribers will be connected to m1s infrastructure via starhubs cable modem open access network
1143783 for now this is cheaper than laying their own infrastructure but i think they would move on to the next generation network that will be set up in a few years time
1143784 i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
1143785 finally im no 1 im very very happy to be no 1
1143786 its a present for a lot of work in the past
1143787 the common gripe of theatre technicians is that we put in twice the amount of work for half the amount of pay as compared to our colleagues in front of the curtain
1143788 youve got the actors directors and scriptwriters and then set lighting and sound designers and then theyll probably need one or two crew members that will do a lot of things for peanuts
1143789 in general singapore has become more expensive from salaries to transport and its not like we have a safe income in this industry
1143790 with the tightening of budgets the first to suffer would be the technical staff with the reduction of fees
1143791 its a good start but i dont see anything coming out of it initially there were a lot of courses but now its kind of quieted down
1143792 sound design for theatre used to be two dog barks and one door slam and the kind of interaction well have with the director is theyll say that the bark is too loud or the light too bright
1143793 the guy who comes in and turns on the sound
1143794 when i go to schools to do shows there are only a handful of students willing to learn and do hands on stuff
1143795 i almost broke down i was handling 20 actors like kumar and irene ang and had crazy schedules to coordinate im quite proud i pulled it off
1143796 theres always an adrenalin rush for us backstage people to get things done
1143797 but now our dignity has increased so that we can shake hands with all kinds of people

1143799 planejamos manter os dois pilotos e eu n o acho que exista qualquer d vida quanto a isso para ser honesto
1143800 o que mais a ferrari pode pedir a este piloto
1143801 ele parece uma p lida imita o do piloto do passado a ferrari n o precisa deste raikkonen ele precisa perguntar a si mesmo se ainda tem esse desejo
1143802 my teacher told me im suitable for the long jump because of my speed
1143803 in other countries the first step is to enjoy the sport and step by step you get better but here from the beginning they say you must do sports youre strong youre big
1143804 there are many disciplines of sport where its not possible to go from nothing to 100 in three or four years you need eight or 10 years
1143805 were engaging in bulk buying from large suppliers of raw materials to enjoy cost savings
1143806 another strategy is to diversify into other businesses such as economic bee hoon and yong tau foo stalls
1143807 we will supply them with our foodstuffs if they are along our distribution routes
1143808 as long as hawkers need our supply we will try to deliver transportation costs remain the same but sales have increased by about 20 per cent over the past two years
1143809 we will continue to improve the way of running the company through training and courses
1143810 if my kids are not interested we will find someone outside the family to keep the business going
1143811 we are expanding into the halal market as well as restaurants supermarkets and export services
1143812 fish oil is not a sustainable source of omega 3 dha and epa essential fats algae oil is an ethical organic fair trade sustainably grown alternative
1143813 the data access alone is a classic example of what id call privileged abuse
1143814 this gentleman had legitimate reasons to access this data but not on sunday and not to download 20 000 records at a time simple monitoring should have caught this
1143815 it would be a reasonable use entirely but at the very least there should be monitoring of the type of information that is being downloaded to external devices
1143816 weve been closely monitoring this exploit since its release and are now tracking several hundred occurrences in the wild found mostly in china
1143817 there is currently no patch available but microsoft has several workarounds listed in their advisory
1143818 it could be higher as things change and progress we cant unfortunately predict them and unfortunately its arriving at high tide
1143819 there could be considerable impact in the low lying areas so what were asking people to do is obviously pick up any belongings that may be in yards
1143820 when the national anthem is performed or sung every person present shall stand up as a mark of respect
1143821 food labels are there so that consumers can get the information they need to know before they buy this is important not just for health reasons but also for people who follow specific diets or have food allergies
1143822 in this case someone who was vegetarian unwittingly purchased a product that contained meat this falls well below the standards that consumers can expect and would not have happened if appropriate action had been taken by the supermarket following earlier complaints from other customers
1143823 any consumers who consider that food is mis described or mis labelled should inform trading standards by calling consumer direct on 08454 04 05 06
1143824 it is always an honor for our program and our players to be recognized by the coaches within the conference to be voted as the preseason number two team in the conference is great
1143825 we look forward to the upcoming season and trying to get back to the top of the conference and hopefully to get another chance at playing for the conference championship in november
1143826 i am happy for selena and ali they have both worked very hard the last few years to improve themselves individually and they have helped our program move in a positive direction the last couple of years
1143827 for the both of them to be selected as preseason all wac is a wonderful honor for them and our program

1143833 we cannot tolerate bigotry racism ethnicism or whatever it is but the jurors in the case that stood up against juror no 8 did the right thing and i am convinced that the verdict that was reached was the verdict of only those jurors
1143834 if only every jury in this country would react to racism the way this jury did we would have a better judicial system

1143840 outsourcing is basically a trade off the pursuit of lower unit costs will steadily dismantle the integrated engineering community from our perspective in the workplace community adds intangible value that is critical for our long term success if outsourcing decisions discount or minimize that value the predictable consequence will be the weakening of our ability to compete in the long term
1143841 if our outsourcing strategies prove disappointing as some other industries have found then our ability to retreat and recover will be limited
1143842 growth is expected to pick up in the december 2008 quarter owing to the combined effects of tax cuts on 1 october 2008 recovery from the drought high export prices the weakening new zealand dollar and more reductions in the official cash rate
1143843 my sole concern is the money was used for party purposes but getting a straight answer from new zealand first is a recipe for disappointment
1143844 if the money has not reached the party it constitutes theft if i receive another evasive reply then clearly it is a matter for the police
1143845 computational science now constitutes the third pillar of the scientific enterprise a peer alongside theory and physical experimentation this is especially important in a field such as climate change studies where the models are complex multidisciplinary and multivariate and one cannot conduct parametric experiments at planetary scale fortunately the same technology used to build desktop and laptop computers now enables us to evaluate these complex models

1143857 neo conservatives never cease to amaze me with their mind boggling egos and unparallelled access to what god wants and needs mccain fail
1143858 hehe hes not too different from the others he may still be useful for us
1143859 read his comment carefully he a slave to their system just as much our followers are to ours it wont matter if i loose this election i have more than enough resources to survive this new political climate they will become our bread and butter
1143860 hey i need a scape goat this election season so can get elected can you help me out

1143862 perhaps your reward will be in heaven not here on earth
1143863 he sees you when youre sleeping he knows when youre awake he knows when youve been bad or good so be good for goodness sake
1143864 repeatedly points out that has a funny name and then accuses mccain of using that against him at some point in the future
1143865 with a name like that he has to have some ties

1143868 obama traitor to american principles votes for fisa and telecom immunity
1143869 theres an interesting line building on obama that somehow success and intelligence are a handicap
1143870 be taken out to the woodshed for that utter stupidity
1143871 raising taxes to curtail our economy forcing americans to pay high prices at the pump instead of utilizing the rest of our petroleum reserves

1143933 to the breakdown of the moral fiber of the country
1143934 i thought we had freedoms and my distribution is so small i didnt think theyd mess with me
1143935 one christmas when i was eight my dad went to an auction and bought two huge bags of voodoo dolls that were handmade in haiti we had hundreds of them so we hung a bunch of them on the christmas tree as ornaments
1143936 when i was about 12 i had a pet hamster that was a male and my sister had a female hamster so one night our mom called me and my sister into her room and had us each bring our hamsters she said it was time to teach us about sex she laid the hamsters on her bed and made me and my sister watch them mate after the hamsters finished she told us that that was sex was

1143938 they said obscenity and they said they could arrest me right there for it and they asked me a lot of questions about it but i didnt answer any of them
1143939 i think it was just like the gainesville hysteria or something
1143940 they said they were trying to save my soul and that they were praying
1143941 i said no but its none of your business anyway then i asked her if she had ever been molested by a priest
1143942 my heart is opposed to what the guys doing it sounds repugnant but free speech if it means anything is the presentation of often repugnant material you cant say im for free speech except in this one area
1143943 i cant think of any right that an individual has that isnt limited in one way or another by the laws we have all decided to live by thats what we teach our children
1143944 if a publication can drive someone to acts of violence parts of the bible should have been cut out long ago

1144034 you put my brother in jail now its your turn to get punished
1144035 looks like calleighs not so tough after all little miss priss cant do much without her crime fighting kit huh
1144036 i im not calleigh im her cousin please leave me alone
1144037 yeah right ive never heard of identical cousins now shut up
1144038 theres been an incident the address from dispatch is yours ryan and natalia are on their way over to check it out right now
1144039 christina im here honey im so sorry this happened my partner eric is here with me hes going to check you out and see if the person who did this to you left anything on you that we can take as evidence ok youre gonna be okay i love you
1144040 cal if theres anything you need just let me know i am so sorry about your cousin well do everything we can to find whoever did this
1144041 my name is eric delko i work with your cousin calleigh i came with her yesterday to see you do you remember me
1144042 yesterday i scraped under your fingernails and took some other clues to find out who did this to you do you think you could tell me anything about what happened at your cousins house yesterday
1144043 i know this is difficult but please try for me and calleigh anything you can tell me will help us a lot
1144044 and then i heard a noise and then i got hit really hard and knocked down
1144045 the man thought i was calleigh he was mad because she had put him in jail he was after calleigh please find him i dont want anything to happen to her
1144046 he had brown hair and i think he had brown eyes he was really strong and he was tall
1144047 she told me she was getting out of the shower and someone attacked her she is afraid that you may be in danger she told me that whoever did this to her is after you because you put them in jail i think she may have meant to say that whoever did this did it because you put their friend or relative in jail if you put someone in jail theyd more than likely still be there can you think of any case that youve had recently where someone threatened you or something like that
1144048 there is one that i can think of do you remember the road rage case we worked we easily solved it but the man was adamant that he shot the other guy in self defense
1144049 wasnt he the one who kept staring at you h had to go with you to court because he feared for your safety we need to figure out if he had a brother
1144050 we found some hairs in calleighs house that obviously do not match calleigh or christina since we already have the one brothers dna in codis all we have to do is see if there are any alleles in common to the dna from this hair
1144051 if that doesnt work i have the scrapings from under christinas fingernails
1144052 whoa there you are not going by yourself im coming with you ive finished up what i need to do and h doesnt mind
1144053 ms duquesne i know your cousin is just visiting florida for a few days but she will need to stay a little while longer hopefully this will not be a problem when the swelling goes down on her arm she needs to come back here so i can put a shorter cast on her wrist the swelling will go down in 3 or 4 more days
1144054 calleigh and i are going to take you back to her house looks like your trip to miami is going to last a few days longer than you thought
1144055 your doctor wants you to stay a little longer so he can watch to see how your wrist is healing and put a shorter cast on it in a few days

1144063 the draft document reads more like a news article in many places than it does a scientific document and unlike a scientific document it has a number of what i would call

1144065 physical and mental health impacts due to extreme weather events are projected to increase
1144066 one month later and the excitement is just not there in the programming
1144067 wwe killed the increase in interest with the manner in which they screwed up their own momentum cm punk is being treated as champion the same was
1144068 now theres nothing wrong with that but the idea was giving someone new the opportunity to sink or swim at a top level thats interesting to watch watching punk only get to bide his time as champion not exciting oh yeah reys on raw too thought id remind you of that because wwe sure hasnt made a big deal about it have they
1144069 oh yeah i remember that and your name on there is cod zee right
1144070 i have to find 50 more for gas this month somehow
1144071 why am i 50 from the edge of the financial cliff every month
1144072 these young ladies have not expressed any desire to be with their mother or her family
1144073 it was an area of society that i had no awareness of
1144074 being in this flat after being in a corporate parenting environment where everything is more or less done for you it was an image of the solitude
1144075 theres a high incidence of some of these people going off the rails sometimes in terms of alcohol or drugs or crime or something like that it gave me something pungent to write about
1144076 i think the world sees these people as thugs when a lot of the time it isnt their fault the way that theyve turned out
1144077 people have to sympathise with these people that theyre in situations that they cant get out of
1144078 i talked to several care leaders several kids in care psychotherapists the whole gamut of the system
1144079 for a lot of these young people the reasons why theyre in care their biography is obscure to them
1144080 a lot of the people that are on stage a lot of the people were representing theyre not always the most communicative
1144081 in fact most of them are not at all im always fascinated about what people give away it might not be a wilful physical expression its moments when they give themselves away
1144082 that you come into a world for an hour and a half or whatever and your perceptions are changed slightly
1144083 everything i set out to write i want to take people in from a different entry point to see that subject matter from a different angle
1144084 i would hope people would come in and be slightly skewed by what they see
1144085 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways
1144086 the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1144087 my first job in all honesty is going to continue to be mom in chief
1144088 making sure that in this transition which will be even more of a transition for the girls that they are settled and that they know they will continue to be the center of our universe
1144089 tack on the fact that there is no sustained mental health support for these families as they are struggling with loved ones who are coming back dealing with emotional issues
1144090 youve got people in pain and we dont hear those voices a lot
1144091 i found it wasnt that barack wasnt interested in helping
1144092 its just that when the baby cried at 4 a m i got up faster than he did because i would hear the baby and i would be up
1144093 where are the musicians this time around how come theyre not protesting

1144095 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making

1144097 i want to be the next president of the united states
1144098 its not the turkish people we greeks dislike its their government
1144099 this isnt working time to start over lets start by having a tea party
1144100 i cant care about what our government does all over the world i have to trust that they know what theyre doing
1144101 the first overarching big problem is to make the good person we must have better human beings or else it is quite possible that we may all be wiped out and even if not wiped out certainly live in tension and anxiety as a a species
1144102 its not personal dammit stop planting deer food and they wont come
1144103 tim ill have to let you go weve got another deer emergency
1144104 shes not dead shes probably just resting and im fairly certain there is no fawn
1144105 i may not have been raised on a farm but im
1144106 that deer is as dead as you can get and her fawn is over there on the other side of our creek
1144107 well have to approach very quietly or we might scare it
1144108 listen if that doe died after giving birth she probably was too old or too sick to survive it that might mean she wasnt able to feed this little thing either and thats not good if animal services cant get any milk into her she wont make it
1144109 sadly the reason we cant do this as well inside our own species is because there are those who would as soon call you crazy as be touched by your experience
1144110 the ability to look at our enemy or what we think is our enemy and see ourselves people animals that just want what we do
1144111 i didnt know lavender was a greek flower good to know

1144114 the situational awareness capabilities afforded by jhmcs in the air to ground mission environment are necessities given todays battlespace and providing a dual seat capability is phenomenally important
1144115 getting our jhmcs on the strike eagle has been a key company goal since we started developing the system in 1996
1144116 vsi through its affiliated company elbit systems of america is working on a jhmcs derivative equipped with four image intensified tubes offering wide field of view night capability

1144137 politicians understand two things they understand votes and they understand money
1144138 so you receive some credibility when you are able to raise money
1144139 its probably good to have a group like this because apparently the politicians dont listen to the average citizens
1144140 not on an individual basis anyway they would listen to you if you were super wealthy so in that regard this is a good thing this will get their attention
1144141 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing

1144156 when was the last time you and you husband gave or received oral sex to each other and really relished it not just because you were horny but because you were doing it with the one person in the world who makes you feel that nothing could possibly be better than this
1144157 where would i find the graham crackers and the peanut butter
1144158 if you are a professional woman your position can be daunting to a man
1144159 where would i find the graham crackers and the peanut butter
1144160 arent looking for a husband but are looking for some lump of clay to form into the man they want
1144161 is she he really interested in me or is this just for fun

1144169 im strongly encouraged by senator obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk
1144170 when i started this campaign my goal was to make this the biggest issue in the coming election and the top priority to be addressed in the first hundred days of the next administration this issue is clearly moving up in the priority of political debate senator obamas statement is an indication that is what is indeed happening i will continue to push this as a priority for the rest of the year

1144172 the top title along with the prison break series have been ticked as first to last the top title should not be selected as first to last as it is the last of the series you have already seen and placed on your list if you could please remove the top title as first to last leave the prison break as they are and try to add more to your list because presently the system can not differentiate between the 4400 title and prison break and it is not checking the rest of your list correctly so basically after i had indicated i wanted to receive the 4400 dvds
1144173 mccain and cheney famously do not get along and with mccains focus being almost exclusively on attracting independents and women to the polls its not a surprise that engaging cheney isnt on the top of his list

1144192 we zijn daar te laat mee begonnen we hadden daar maanden eerder aan moeten gaan werken de luikse markt bestond dit keer slechts uit vier kramen er werden kaarsen hobbyspullen en kleding verkocht omdat de luikse markt pas om 14 00 uur begon waren enkele andere marktlieden die vroeger waren gekomen voor aanvang alweer vertrokken omdat ze dachten dat de markt de hele dag was de kermisattracties stonden veel dichter bij elkaar dan voorgaande keren vroeger zaten er te veel gaten in nu krijgen we alleen maar positieve reacties
1144193 dat komt omdat er vorig jaar tien attracties stonden en nu vijftien
1144194 we gaan altijd met de hele familie naar de kermis
1144195 opa oma oom en tante en wij allemaal dat is zo de traditie op zondag

1144209 if i could sell a house in two weeks rather than six months id be more willing to negotiate

1144212 the biggest problem is not so much whats happened with free trade but our inability to adjust to a new world economy
1144213 overhaul unemployment insurance and make it a program for retraining relocating and assisting workers who have lost a job

1144235 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups
1144236 the only thing ive heard him say is that we should inflate our tires
1144237 so he has no plan for addressing the energy challenges that we face
1144238 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1144239 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1144240 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1144241 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1144242 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1144243 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1144244 you think i aint worth a dollar but i feel like a millionaire

1144246 the cdcs budget for aids prevention in 2006 was only 5 percent higher that it was in 1990
1144247 revised numbers may not mean more federal dollars for those living with aids
1144248 the cdcs hiv funding is about 650 million for 2008 the same as about a decade ago
1144249 since fiscal year 2002 when adjusted for inflation cdcs prevention budget has actually shrunk by 19 percent
1144250 the administrations aids prevention budget for the has hovered at 750 million for the past two years with a proposed cut of 1 million next year
1144251 likely will refocus attention from the effect of aids overseas to what the disease is doing to this country
1144252 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1144253 chief financial officer and leader of al qaedas finance committee
1144254 mullah omar is reported to have opposed this course of action for ideological reasons rather than out of fear of u s retaliation he is said to have preferred for al qaeda to attack jews not necessarily the united states ksm khalid sheik mohammed contends that omar faced pressure from the pakistani government to keep al qaeda from engaging in operations outside afghanistan al qaedas chief financial manager sheikh saeed argued that al qaeda should defer to the talibans wishes another source says that sheikh saeed opposed the operation both out of deference to omar and because he feared the u s response to an attack

1144262 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle

1144264 he has been dealing with the shoulder problem for a long time
1144265 going in to repair the problem is his best chance now to open up next year feeling 100 percent
1144266 a player of his calibre you would always love him to be in your lineup
1144267 but looking at him getting this behind him and ready to contribute on a daily basis next year is exciting
1144268 the good news is his back feels great and his left shoulder is not a problem
1144269 rehabbing three different surgeries at once was not easy this time he will be able to focus on just one thing

1144274 and certainly against a border state opponent traditional rival it ought to galvanize everybody i think it got our players attention several months ago when it was announced
1144275 i think that puts another form of positive pressure on our football program and we like that
1144276 i dont know if you talk about replacing dennis dixon theres a void there he became on of the greatest football players to put on a uniform and certainly one of the most dominant players in college football last year

1144282 me desilusion mucho cuando algunos l deres pol ticos comenzaron a hablar del boicot de los juegos de pek n el deporte une a la gente acerca a las personas de diferentes religiones culturas y razas pese a que hablamos idiomas distintos nos podemos entender y vivir en paz
1144283 este es el poder nico que tiene el deporte y el movimiento ol mpico
1144284 el comit y el movimiento ol mpico han estado promoviendo cambios positivos en china para sus ciudadanos es incre ble el progreso que se ha registrado en estos siete a os tanto el pa s como la gente est n cambiando no hay marcha atr s y no hay necesidad de mezclar las cosas todo se ha hecho gracias al deporte
1144285 no est bamos de acuerdo con esa decisi n pero en ese momento no hab a nada que pudi semos hacer era joven y hab a sido una decisi n que hab a tomado el gobierno
1144286 por supuesto que dir a que fue una decisi n muy mala y dolorosa incluso es m s dolorosa ahora despu s de tantos a os pues te das cuenta de lo que pas al final nadie gan s lo nosotros perdimos especialmente los atletas para quienes competir en unos juegos ol mpicos puede ser una oportunidad que se da una sola vez en la vida y con la que sue an
1144287 yo fui afortunado de poder ir a las olimpiadas cuatro a os despu s pero es un porcentaje muy peque o el que puede hacerlo es una mala decisi n y hoy desde mi posici n intento no transmitirle sentimientos negativos a las generaciones m s j venes
1144288 estaba en buena forma y so con saltar los seis metros en ese momento estaba en excelentes condiciones en parte porque cuatro d as antes mi esposa hab a dado a luz a mi hijo fue un momento muy positivo y emotivo para m me hizo muy feliz ser el primero en saltar los seis metros

1144291 si esta semana se soluciona este impasse creo que en dos meses se culminar an los trabajos y entonces la municipalidad estar feliz de inaugurar su obra la universidad de san marcos estar tranquila al retomar la normalidad de sus actividades y la comunidad observar los beneficios que viene esperando de esta infraestructura
1144292 como se dice la pelota est ahora en la cancha de la municipalidad de lima con la resoluci n del inc y los informes t cnicos de la uni y del colegio de ingenieros de lima as como la voluntad nuestra de dialogar y llegar a una soluci n concordada

1144295 it is difficult to see the relevance of that conclusion in a world where the minister wants everyone in australia to connect over 500 times faster
1144296 how is it possible that we have come this far and covered this much ground over this much time without any attempt by the government to address industry concerns about the on the ground practicalities of implementing the plan
1144297 from past experience in looking at how this has played out in other regions there seems to be a near certainty that legitimate and useful educational sites will be inadvertently blocked as a part of any effort of this sort

1144311 with this test gridgain plants itself on a very different level not only we can claim that gridgain is simple and very productive to use something that our customers realized long before but we can also show now that you can achieve unprecedented results in a fraction of cost and time when running on amazon ec2 cloud infrastructure looking at cost scalability ratio it is truly amazing what performance capability you can get today for a price that was simply economically unthinkable just short 5 years ago
1144312 people are looking to cloud computing for answers to ultimate application scalability but the true limits of these systems are not yet known today we have achieved something significant we proved that if the application itself is perfectly scalable then with the right choice of middleware technology and the right choice of a cloud platform you can achieve a perfect linear scaling up to at least 512 nodes amazon ec2 and gridgain can get you there today
1144313 the iupui campus is a complex environment encompassing hospitals academic buildings labs and sports facilities
1144314 located in the heart of the nations 13th largest city tens of thousands of students staff faculty patients and visitors rely on us on a daily basis to be prepared for maintaining safety and responding to emergencies this grant will enhance our efforts and allow us to develop best practices other urban universities might follow
1144315 these new grants will help college administrators coordinate with law enforcement health officials and state and local governments to prevent violence and prepare institutions to respond quickly and efficiently if emergencies occur
1144316 iupui has a brand new emergency preparedness program and has a fully developed campus wide plan for emergency evacuation the emhe grant will finance the creation of other campus wide emergency plans and additional planning efforts that will increase iupuis capabilities to prepare for respond to and recover from any type of man made or naturally caused disaster
1144317 the challenge of this grant is that all projects are expected to encompass the full grant term of 18 months so all will be run concurrently
1144318 in emergency management there are many no 1 priorities and we are accustomed to multi tasking to achieve all objectives that will raise our level of preparedness
1144319 ellos estar n dando su mejor esfuerzo porque si algo les sobra a nuestros muchachos es coraz n y coraje del bueno ellos se marcharon regal ndonos ese oro a la revoluci n deportiva ahora esperamos que puedan volver con las manos llenas de satisfacci n por la misi n cumplida

1144324 youll find that theres barbed wire on the top of that fence and it will
1144325 if youre paying 10 000 in taxes for your little mom and pop bakery youd have to bake a lot of buns just to pay your tax bill
1144326 i could see for many people unless you absolutely had to be in the city youd want to run your business somewhere else
1144327 i dont remember what my taxes were when i bought the building in 1992 which to me means they were not significant
1144328 i had no confidence that commercial real estate taxes would be controlled in any reasonable way
1144329 i would much prefer to be in toronto but it makes no sense
1144330 if this building was located 300 yards south on the other side of steeles in toronto i dont think i could afford it
1144331 its all well and good to cushion residents however at a certain point people dont have to be here and they do leave
1144332 we needed to expand our business and the only place that you could actually find an area big enough was north in vaughan
1144333 taxes are lower and utilities in a brand new building are a lot cheaper too
1144334 we forgo those partly on the basis that our business and commercial property taxes are higher so were trying to do what we can in the short term to balance that tax differential
1144335 were forgiving the front end development charges because we want the jobs
1144336 the citys proposal to bring the tax ratio in line is worthless because at a minimum youre looking at 10 years before they achieve that level
1144337 and each year your taxes still go up but the residential tax rate is going up faster than the commercial rate
1144338 maybe people will be happy about it in 10 years if there is anyone working in the city anymore
1144339 i think the benefits of introducing these measures in a more prompt fashion would pay off many times over in terms of the economic growth and vitality in the city
1144340 the performance of 905 is important to toronto and the performance of toronto is important to 905

1144346 stores are flipping and nobody wants to take a chance i wouldnt choose a place where stores keep flipping over thats not a good sign
1144347 a lot of landlords are making the rent so high because theyre hoping for a starbucks or a major chain to come in theyre waiting for the big guys
1144348 i dont know if thats a problem of the retailers lacking capital or whether its because the rents are too high it might be a combination of the two they pop up and just disappear
1144349 if there are really trendy spots that are seeing values go way up their share of the total assessment pie goes up and their share of the tax bill goes up too thats bad news for retailers even if theyre renting
1144350 theres no question that theres a residential filling in and theyre saying its more of an affluent consumer coming down
1144351 i think theres a frustration for the smaller ma and pa regional players but what can you do its really only following consumer behaviour
1144352 ive never seen such an interest in downtown street properties

1144819 according to the dsas policy where a population density is greater than 1 250 people per square kilometre learner drivers should not have to travel more than seven miles to take their test
1144820 kidderminster stourport and bewdley combined cover an area of 46 9 square kilometres and have a population of 84 073
1144821 this means residents should have access to a test centre within seven miles
1144822 you have a cocktail of conditions that add up to extreme stress on the athlete
1144823 with these readings you are talking more than 20 times a high day in sydney or melbourne and 10 times the most extreme pollution day in sydney or melbourne
1144824 on those days back home asthmatics are told to stay inside
1144825 when you add the elements of heat humidity and athletes pushing themselves to the brink it is quite possible an athlete will die during these olympics
1144826 but its actually better today with the haze over than it was yesterday with the bright sun
1144827 i dont know how well go with breathing but i struggled a lot more with yesterdays heat than today
1144828 fortunately our courts only 8m by 8m and theres two teams one on each side of the net 16m we dont have to look too far well be right
1144829 the air quality being a bit thicker i did feel it today when i got out of bed i think itll take todays training session to probably work through that we just literally suck it up and get on with it and thats what were here to do
1144830 politically they just wont reschedule events it would be a humiliation for beijing
1144831 but from a health and safety perspective organisers coaches and administrators do have a duty of care to ensure their athletes are not put at risk
1144832 it wont so much affect the sprinters but for middle distance and long distance athletes there is a big risk certainly if we were in australia endurance events would be put off
1144833 were standing up for america were supporting the troops and were telling politicians that its time to end the iraq war now
1144834 longshore workers are standing down on the job and standing up for america
1144835 were supporting the troops and telling politicians in washington that its time to end the war in iraq
1144836 big foreign corporations that control global shipping arent loyal or accountable to any country
1144837 for them its all about making money but longshore workers are different were loyal to america and we wont stand by while our country our troops and our economy are destroyed by a war thats bankrupting us to the tune of 3 trillion dollars its time to stand up and were doing our part today
1144838 the federal reserve the central bank of the united states provides the nation with a safe flexible and stable monetary and financial system
1144839 steady growth low inflation and rock bottom interest rates encouraged economic and financial participants across the world economy to gear up over the past few years
1144840 easy money encouraged many to buy a bigger house a bigger car or a bigger speculative position
1144841 but now any behavior that relied upon continued access to easy money is being dramatically reassessed
1144842 leveraged banks must lend less leveraged consumers must consume less leveraged companies must acquire or invest less and leveraged speculators must speculate less
1144843 we would continue to avoid the sector while they are de leveraging
1144844 there will be plenty of companies that have strong balance sheets so may not be most immediately vulnerable to the credit crunch
1144845 but they may find that their leveraged customers are vulnerable
1144846 it is the leverage of the investors who hold these bonds that is now being brutally exposed
1144847 we are now confronted by a broad bloodbath in the credit markets
1144848 the most leveraged paper is falling in value because it is leveraged and now the least leveraged paper is also falling in value because it is owned by leveraged investors
1144849 private equity returns have been especially strong without leverage it will be much harder to meet excessive investor expectations most surveys suggest 20 annual returns are expected from the asset class
1144850 similarly many hedge funds have generated healthy uncorrelated returns by adopting cautious underlying strategies but applying significant leverage again that looks unsustainable in the current environment
1144851 the u s shows up as the worlds greatest consumer of external capital

1144867 we dont have any decision in any court that is definitive we have a temporary measure in a court in new york and we have the right to respond that is to say a transitory measure and we are sure that we are going to defeat this measure
1144868 i cant really say that im aware this has been used in other investment disputes they may be trying to get the government to settle
1144869 although exxon is within their rights to persue a temporary embargo of pdvsa assets they will probably have to prove that pdvsa has no intention of compensating them
1144870 however pdvsa has been very careful to insist that they will still negotiate with exxon to achieve an acceptable compromise

1144920 observations on the message integrity code in ieee802 11wireless lans
1144921 weve put names to men whove burned their fingerprints off to elude identification this suspect will be no different
1144922 there is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate that if not destroyed the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair even slow breeding man has doubled in twenty five years and at this rate in a few thousand years there would literally not be standing room for his progeny
1144923 all animated life tends to increase beyond the nourishment prepared for it
1144924 our present danger is from anarchy a danger of being led through an admiration of successful fraud and violence to an imitation of the excess of an irrational unprincipled proscribing confiscatory plundering ferocious bloody and tyrannical democracy on the side of religion the danger is no longer from intolerance but from atheism a foul uncanny vice a foe to all the dignity and consolation of mankind which seems in france for a long time to have been embodied into a faction accredited and almost avowed
1144925 panic struck the upper classes of britain when they found themselves faced by another revolution so soon after the costly revolt of the american colonies the thousand year old world of kings and aristocracies seemed to be collapsing besieged by peasants burning feudal chateaux and title deeds and by city mobs imprisoning the royal family and cutting off hundreds of noble heads
1144926 we should encourage contrary habits in our towns we should make the streets narrower crowd more people into the houses and court the return of the plague in the country we should build our villages near stagnant pools and particularly encourage settlements in all marshy and unwholesome situations
1144927 i happened to read for amusement malthus on population and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long continued observation of the habits of animals and plants it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavourable ones to be destroyed
1144928 acceptance of the first and foremost responsibility of the elite to subdue all expressions of unprincipled natural man
1144929 the weakest and stupidest went to the wall while the toughest and shrewdest those who were best fitted to cope with their circumstances survived life was a continual free fight and beyond the limited and temporary relations of the family the hobbesian war of each against all was the normal state of existence the human species like others plashed and floundered amid the general stream of evolution keeping its head above water as it best might and thinking neither of whence nor whither
1144930 one of the most essential conditions if not the chief cause of the struggle for existence is the tendency to multiply without limit which tendency man shares with all living things
1144931 the effort of ethical man to work towards a moral end by no means abolished the deep seated organic impulses which impel the natural man to follow his non moral course
1144932 society not only has a moral end but in its perfection social life is embodied morality
1144933 founds his life on a more or less complete self restraint which is the negation of the unlimited struggle for existence
1144934 that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate that if not destroyed the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair
1144935 has doubled in twenty five years and this rate in a few thousand years there would literally not be standing room for his progeny
1144936 the greatest authority of all the advocates of war is darwin
1144937 since the theory of evolution has been promulgated they can cover their natural barbarism with the name of darwin and proclaim the sanguinary instincts of their inmost hearts as the last word of science
1144938 there must in every case be a struggle for existence either one individual with another of the same species or with the individuals of distinct species or with the physical conditions of life it is the doctrine or malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdom
1144939 t h huxley said that all the molecules within each organism were competing with each other august weismann a german biologist suggested that the particles of germ plasm were in conflict with each other so that the ancestors who had contributed them could be seen as struggling with each other as to which should be re created wilhelm roux developed the theory that the organs were struggling with each other for nourishment kidneys against lungs heart against brain neither darwin nor his immediate followers had much feeling for the internal stability and harmony of the organism
1144940 darwin took it over from malthus who was a sociologist and a grim one rather than a biologist it was not derived from a loving contemplation of plants and animals such a contemplation would show that there were always more seeds than were needed for the replacement of the parents but it would not show that each organic being was striving to increase at a geometrical ratio or that there was continual struggle
1144941 most of the associations between the living things we know about are essentially cooperative ones symbiotic in one degree or another when they have the look of adversaries it is usually a standoff relation with one party issuing signals warnings flagging the other off
1144942 instead of endorsing the eighteenth century concept of a drive toward perfection
1144943 darwin merely postulated change by chance this process of adaptation sometimes results in changes that can be interpreted as progress but there is no intrinsic mechanism generating inevitable advance
1144944 implied that all the diversity of life on earth had resulted from natural and random processes and not as previously believed from the creative activity of god the acceptance of this great claim and the consequent elimination of god from nature was to play a decisive role in the secularization of western society
1144945 a timorous people which knows not how to use its elbows may of course put a stop to the increase of population it might find things too narrow at home the superfluity of population might find no economic existence a people happy in its future however knows nothing of artificial limitation its only care can be to find room on the globe for a livelihood for other members of its own race
1144946 in the interest of the worlds civilization it is our duty to enlarge germanys colonial empire thus alone can we politically or at least nationally unite the german civilization throughout the world for only then will they recognize that german civilization is the most necessary factor in human progress we must endeavor to acquire new territories throughout the world by all means in our power because we must preserve to germany the millions of germans who will be born in the future and we must provide for them food and employment they ought to be enabled to live under a german sky and to lead a german life
1144947 we should probably find that inferior and degenerate races would overcome healthy and youthful ones by their wealth and their numbers the generative importance of war lies in this that it causes selection and thus war becomes a biological necessity
1144948 that bitter struggle for existence among animals belonging to the same species which was considered by most darwinists though not always by darwin himself as the dominant characteristic of the struggle for life and the main factor of evolution
1144949 who are the fittest those who are continually at war with each other or those who support one another
1144950 when the present war began involving nearly all europe in a terrible struggle and this struggle assumed a never yet known character of wholesale destruction of life among the non combatants and pillage of the means of subsistence of the civil population struggle for existence became the favorite explanation with those who tried to find an excuse for these horrors
1144951 was built on a biomedical vision that required the kind of racial purification that would progress from sterilization to extensive killing
1144952 hitler had declared the sacred racial mission of the german people to be assembling and preserving the most valuable stocks of basic racial elements and
1144953 if the power to fight for ones own health is no longer present the right to live in this world of struggle ends
1144954 the twentieth century would be incomprehensible without the darwinian revolution
1144955 the social and political currents which have swept the world in the past eighty years would not have been possible without its intellectual sanction
1144956 became the symbol the image the inducement the reason and the language of all human doings on the planet no one who has not waded through some sizable part of the literature of the period 1870 1914 has any conception of the extent to which it is one long call for blood

1145020 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
1145021 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
1145022 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
1145023 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1145024 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1145025 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
1145026 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
1145027 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
1145028 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1145029 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
1145030 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

1145044 o cruzeiro est bem maduro na sua responsabilidade dentro de campo a equipe conquistou bons resultados e vem tendo uma regularidade neste campeonato que n o tinha antes que n o vinha tendo e isso est fazendo com que a equipe mostre o futebol e v atr s das vit rias e tamb m consiga reverter os resultados durante as partidas
1145045 n s viemos j h algum tempo tentando conquistar essas vit rias mas infelizmente ela estava escapando em alguns detalhes que a gente estava pecando como aconteceu no jogo do sport tamb m contra o coritiba que a gente teve chance de fazer mais gols mas acabamos sofrendo um gol que ningu m estava esperando e fomos derrotados
1145046 nesses ltimos jogos a equipe entrou com a mentalidade de equipe campe que precisa desses pontos fora de casa para manter uma boa regularidade na competi o e a ponta da tabela

1145060 such fundamental knowledge holds great potential for the development of improved biologically inspired structural materials for example soldier first responder and military vehicle armor applications
1145061 many of the design principles we describe durable interfaces and energy dissipating mechanisms for instance may be translatable to human armor systems
1145062 the advantage of this technology is that it allows you to look at the molecular disposition the placement of molecules and thats critical in disease
1145063 for example if you wanted to look at the edge of a tumor one of the things that you want to know is that edge rapidly growing is it an aggressive edge or is it somewhat dormant or is the tumor not going to grow
1145064 the effort here has been how do we get these kinds of fantastic discoveries at the molecular level that occur at the basic science research labs now into the clinical arena and eventually to the bedside
1145065 the lasers bounce energy into the tissues to bounce molecules out and thats how we measure these
1145066 its an exciting new technology but its not just for gear heads this will make a major difference in how we diagnose and prognose disease
1145067 the disposition of molecules varies greatly and its very difficult to see this if not impossible to see this in some of the normal histological tests that are done
1145068 the challenge then is to work with the clinicians and the pathologists who will look at that piece of tissue and say look i think this area of the tissue looks compromised in some way but from a microscope thats all you can really say the technology that were developing then goes into these areas uses the art and practice of the pathologist to now look at the molecular makeup of those areas of the tissue and now were able to say yes that is a very aggressive molecular pattern or not
1145069 you can look at the genomic information as a type of blueprint for cells but what is actually built what actually makes us up as human beings is different in every single person
1145070 and so that genetic component directs molecules to be made but we really need to know what actually is made because not all of them are made at any one given time they change in time and they change in space
1145071 we were working with the and there were some collaborators there who got a sample from sweden from a lady who died of a disease and the biopsy was taken 109 years go and it was sitting in a preservative for this 109 years and we were able then to use our technology to discover what the disease was
1145072 it shows you the robustness of the molecular makeup of tissue and how modern technology can pull these mysteries apart and lead us to understanding what the disease of a particular patient is
1145073 they go back many many years biopsies that were taken many years ago and most importantly the outcome of the patient is known so this gives us the opportunity then to look at the molecular makeup of that disease and that biopsy and then know what happened to the patient
1145074 the value that this multiplexed imaging brings is that each imaging modality brings a new view and when you put them together then you get a whole leap in understanding
1145075 for example the technology that were developing can take molecular pictures and insert them into mri images and so where theres an aberration in am mri image it may not be clear what the molecular counterpart of it is we can then put that in the image and so it really brings a whole new dimension to imaging to mix these different modalities
1145076 many years ago for example lasers were research tools and now we have them in our players at home we have them in almost every electronic device that we buy says caprioli
1145077 these things become routine and i think instruments like this will be routine in clinical analysis in a very short period of time

1145081 purdue is moving forward as an international player for large scale research thanks to the leadership and commitment of our faculty researchers and students and the state of the art facilities in discovery park and elsewhere on campus
1145082 these record figures affirm purdues efforts to lead this revolution on university campuses to drive research that solves the worlds problems in health science energy the environment and other areas
1145083 with entrepreneurially minded faculty and a stronger commitment to seek out strategic partnerships purdue is well positioned to advance our discovery portfolio beyond these record funding levels looking forward we also are building on purdues strengths and discovery parks interdisciplinary focus to advance our regional national and international partnerships
1145084 purdue has created a culture where we can take faculty out of departments colleges and schools and put them in research driven centers
1145085 there they can team on interdisciplinary research to achieve new goals and solve challenges that make a difference in our world
1145086 this study will expand on two successful animal studies of rabicide i performed previously by the government of vietnam
1145087 in those prior studies we achieved a 25 to 30 survival rate in animals that had already developed rabies we believe this strong survival rate is a historical first achievement for any post infection rabies treatment
1145088 collaborating with cdc in designing and conducting these studies is an important step forward
1145089 if the current studies are successful we anticipate that this will be instrumental in helping our anti rabies nanoviricide towards drug approval and widespread use across the world

1145142 for most of the past people lived in groups of 50 to 70 and there were multiple generations and multiple people we were interconnected with
1145143 but in societies like our own the emphasis is on individualism i suspect that the increase of mental illness that were seeing is related to that factor its hard to prove it because we cant go back in time and we can only guess that there really is more depression today than there used to be but we can make a compelling case for it

1145165 luchetti keeps the drama surprisingly light vibrantly shot using handheld cameras this is an amusing engagingly acted film
1145166 luchetti deliberately set out to make a film that was not overtly political but rather about people caught up by the tide of the times handsomely shot and astutely cast
1145167 the film provides a great insight into one of the most troubled and contradictory periods of italian history
1145168 aided by the solid direction of co writer luchetti scripters petraglia and rulli seem to take special pleasure in the volatility of the brothers and their family members
1145169 with daniele luchettis warm and intimate directorial style and germanos magnetic tremendously modulated central performance
1145170 markovics gives a brilliantly understated performance in an engrossing powerful film that justifies its billing as this seasons the lives of others
1145171 superbly designed and incisively acted based on a true story the counterfeiters is anchored in markovics central turn
1145172 with a robust dramatic drive and thrilling pace ruzowitzky accordingly ramps up the tension but all the while hes careful to respect the harsh reality in which his thoughtful movie is firmly rooted
1145173 the moral dilemmas marshaled by austrian director stefan ruzowitzky prove absolutely gripping and the whole film is alive with style an intelligence
1145174 mr markovics without sentimentalizing the character allows us glimpses of his soul his performance is a tour de force of concentration and understatement
1145175 markovics inhabits his not nice character with such conviction that were freed to consider him as a man not just a victim an authentic gift in a fascinating story of faking it

1145188 he treated each one of us as if we were his own kid and theres nothing we wanted more than to give this to him
1145189 on wednesday assistant coach al liermann came and made the announcement about jims passing and we put it up to the team whether we were going to stay and play or not
1145190 it was a unanimous decision to stay and play because its what jim believed in and what he wouldve wanted from the girls
1145191 as much as it looked easy the way we played it still gets you in your gut when youre out there you just expect to see him coach didi and its hard
1145192 it was just amazing how one event can bring all of these different people from different places and backgrounds together
1145193 didi was one of my best friends he was the true definition of the word coach
1145194 he coached kids to make their way in life through hard work he coached people around him to succeed in the tough situations he faced in life that was what he knew how to do coach and he did it well
1145195 loyalty was a huge thing with him and he was always giving to everyone else if they were loyal to him
1145196 he always taught us to push ourselves harder when we felt like giving up and to keep going strong when we didnt think we could
1145197 he would push any college coach about a player just to get them to take one look at a girl
1145198 and didi was a very good judge of skill if he sees potential in a player he will go to war with them college coaches to get the girl a scholarship and help someone elses family out

1145203 the rate of aids diagnoses for black women was nearly 23 times the rate for white women
1145204 the thing about african americans is they dont want to know
1145205 they feel like if they dont know it aint going to hurt them and when they do find out they dont want to talk about it if we could just break the silence i think that we can prevent a lot of hiv and aids in the african american community
1145206 people in situations are going to not have access to the information they need or the healthcare they need
1145207 theyre doing things for survival that they might not do if they werent in such dire circumstances
1145208 there was a time when a woman was expected to have sex with the master of the house and the masters son and her husband could do nothing for her
1145209 that silence is historic and people not talking about what happens in terms of sexual relationships has been handed down through generations
1145210 and you also have to remember theres clearly the continued racism thats still pervasive there was a recent study in the new england journal of medicine on implicit bias that takes place among physicians treating african american versus non african american patients in terms of the types of treatments that are provided
1145211 my research team documented in the early 90s and published our results showing that the most conservative african americans we surveyed church congregations that 30 percent of them believed that hiv was a man made virus unleashed on the black community
1145212 the fact that the theme resonates today is a serious problem and is contributing to the spread
1145213 we have allowed our problems with addressing the issue of homosexuality to blind us to the results of what it means to have people closeted what it means to have men marry because the homophobia is so devastating therefore they engage in same sex behavior with men and come home to the woman
1145214 theres a stigma attached to it so people dont come out and admit they have it a lot of people dont realize how real it is in their own neighborhoods
1145215 at some earlier stages in this epidemic it was lack of a perceived risk
1145216 they saw it as a white gay male disease so the behaviors that put people at risk unprotected sex and sharing needles with people who were infected didnt apply to them from their own perspective
1145217 black leadership in the early days said we cannot own hiv aids because it will be used to denigrate us
1145218 one fourth of the people living with hiv in the united states in one study have been incarcerated at some point
1145219 a man who may have been in jail for a considerable time and then leaves that environment may move to heterosexual companionship but may move in a situation which the adequate support system in terms of education and treatment arent there in terms of hiv so its a complex situation with poverty racism and incarceration also becoming part of the paradigm in terms of hiv spread
1145220 president bush has this wonderful program outside the u s but washington d c has infection rates higher than most of the places that pepfar dollars go
1145221 but in the u s we dont have a national aids plan we dont have continuing growth of resources as the number of new infections and the number of people living longer with hiv grow in this country
1145222 in the african american community you hear the statistics but you dont see the results
1145223 when its happening at home really up close you cant see the forest for the trees people arent talking about it people arent broadcasting it making it a major issue
1145224 now weve got some good churches out there who are rolling up their sleeves and fighting
1145225 during the time period 2001 2004 hiv diagnosis rates among black males and females declined by 4 4 percent and 6 8 percent respectively
1145226 results from a 2007 study reported similar declines among african americans in the state of florida
1145227 its promising that were moving away from being disease specific aids over here heart disease over there and talking more broadly about health disparities and addressing the common risk factors
1145228 and that means you must address the issue of poverty and health literacy
1145229 if you take aids out the isolated box and put it in a broader context of other racial and ethnic health disparities cardiovascular disease diabetes infant mortality it destigmatizes it in some ways
1145230 i go back and look at the kinds of things that happened in the civil rights movement

1145302 the last nice thing you can do for your pet
1145303 confess the world and all things which are contained in it both spiritual and material as regards their whole substance have been produced by god from nothing
1145304 by the word of the lord the heavens were made and all their host stars nebulae planets by the breath of his mouth
1145305 the teaching authority of the church does not forbid that in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology research and discussions take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre existent and living matter but the catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by god
1145306 though faith is above reason there can never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason since the same god who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind god cannot deny himself nor can truth ever contradict truth
1145307 the question about the origins of the world and of man has been the object of many scientific studies which have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos the development of life forms and the appearance of man these discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the creator prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers
1145308 and there was evening and there was morning one day
1145309 scripture presents the work of the creator symbolically as a succession of six days of divine work concluded by the rest of the seventh day
1145310 nothing exists that does not owe its existence to god the creator the world began when gods word drew it out of nothingness all existent beings all of nature and all human history is rooted in this primordial event the very genesis by which the world was constituted and time begun
1145311 when however there is question of another conjectural opinion namely polygenism the children of the church by no means enjoy such liberty for the faithful cannot embrace that opinion which maintains either that after adam there existed on this earth true men who did not take their origin through natural generation from him as from the first parents of all or that adam represents a certain number of first parents now it is in no way apparent how such an opinion can be reconciled that which the sources of revealed truth and the documents of the teaching authority of the church proposed with regard to original sin which proceeds from a sin actually committed by an individual adam in which through generation is passed onto all and is in everyone as his own
1145312 the account of the fall in genesis 3 uses figurative language but affirms a primeval event a deed that took place at the beginning of the history of man revelation gives us the certainty of faith that the whole of human history is marked by the original fault freely committed by our first parents
1145313 no real disagreement can exist between the theologian and the scientist provided each keeps within his own limits if nevertheless there is a disagreement it should be remembered that the sacred writers or more truly the spirit of god who spoke through them did not wish to teach men such truths as the inner structure of visible objects which do not help anyone to salvation and that for this reason rather than trying to provide a scientific exposition of nature they sometimes describe and treat these matters either in a somewhat figurative language or as the common manner of speech those times required and indeed still requires nowadays in everyday life even amongst most learned people
1145314 methodical research in all branches of knowledge provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws can never conflict with the faith because the things of the world and the things the of the faith derive from the same god the humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led as it were by the hand of god in spite of himself for it is god the conserver of all things who made them what they are

1145396 theres a bit of this myth that we just decide what were going to do tell everybody and off they go and do it
1145397 but think of the savings that procter will make on tide in every aspect of it the water it takes to make that product when its double concentrated the plastic that they have to buy
1145398 commitment to sustainability acts as an inspiration and incentive to other corporations to follow suit
1145399 the company has enormous influence on corporate thinking and i am delighted with the priorities it has selected
1145400 as far as im concerned the only way we can make the kinds of changes that need to happen is to work within the system
1145401 theres a lot of jockeying for position and for the most part these companies all operate the same
1145402 there isnt another retailer that has that leverage over suppliers
1145403 we all have families were all exposed to the environment including people at wal mart
1145404 the incredible heat that they were under from these groups has been greatly reduced
1145405 wal mart is listening to them and theyve been talking rather than just having a slugfest
1145406 katrina asked this critical question and i want to ask it of you what would it take for wal mart to be that company at our best all the time
1145407 will i destroy the company over our environment policy no
1145408 my job is to keep 75 000 people employed and one million customers a day happy
1145409 the leadership that the facebook team is showing here rivals anything that the large and established software and web companies have done in this decade
1145410 arent the decendents of convicts down in australia supposed to be badass
1145411 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that
1145412 i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
1145413 aint it awful if those little girls slept with as many men as they say in the tabloids why their little butts would have more fingerprints than the fbi
1145414 i kinda feel sorry for them we should give those two a break
1145415 a lot of little kids come up to me and say aunt dolly
1145416 i think there have been enough boobs in the white house
1145417 weve had a woman we have a black man and an old stiff
1145418 people are always asking me in interviews what do you think of foreign affairs
1145419 ellos insisten en que tienen un papel escritura le llaman con eso dicen ser due os nosotros mostramos nuestra sangre originaria ancestral poseedora del lugar sa es nuestra prueba de posesi n
1145420 el enemigo es grande y poderoso pero tenemos derechos y los haremos respetar
1145421 s lo recuperamos lo que nos pertenec a aunque la justicia winka blanca est del lado del poderoso
1145422 ya hace un a o que estamos pasaron muchas cosas amenazas fr o necesidades y temores pero tambi n la solidaridad de hermanos mapuches y no mapuches s lo queremos trabajar y vivir en armon a con la mapu tierra algunos lo entienden otros nos quieren echar el juez amenaza desalojarnos les dan la raz n al dinero del poderoso pero no nos iremos
1145423 primero habl de donaci n de tierras le aclaramos que as no era que nadie puede donar lo que no es de l que ten a que ser restituci n o devoluci n entonces propuso que donar a al estado argentino y que ste podr a restituir las tierras
1145424 tengo 56 a os trabaj en m s de quince empresas siempre me explotaron
1145425 desde chiquitos nos discriminan un solo ejemplo le cuento en la escuela nunca nos dejaban hablar nuestro idioma era mala palabra hablarlo todo el tiempo nos quieren arrancan nuestra propia cultura
1145426 nuestra cultura nos pide volver a las ra ces la relaci n con la mapu tierra puede desaparecer un tiempo pero siempre est en nosotros es lo m s fuerte que tenemos
1145427 no nos vamos a dejar morir y no vamos a dejar nuestra tierra
1145428 se produce una sistem tica violaci n de los derechos humanos y graves agresiones al medio ambiente que padecer an hombres y mujeres de los sectores m s vulnerables del campo
1145429 se registra una ausencia del estado en todos sus niveles y falta de acceso a la justicia para los sectores m s vulnerables con la violaci n a veces burda a veces sutil del principio de igualdad ante la ley
1145430 es una forma de acorralar y presionar al campesino para que abandone el lugar
1145431 lejos de mejorar cada d a se suman nuevas denuncias de atropellos a campesinos e ind genas ahora estamos interviniendo en mendoza la zona sur en el nihuil donde puesteros que estuvieron all por generaciones est n siendo desalojados es una situaci n que no para de agravarse
1145432 existe en nuestro pa s un modelo agropecuario basado en la exportaci n y la producci n intensiva de altos insumos y concentrado en pocas manos el modelo genera muchos ingresos en divisas gran parte queda en manos de los terratenientes y un porcentaje queda en el gobierno a trav s de las retenciones a las exportaciones las elites del agro lo promocionan como un modelo muy desarrollado y eficiente sin embargo la otra cara de esta forma de producir es una gran contaminaci n del medio ambiente alta degradaci n de los suelos alta dependencia externa por los insumos y una gran deuda social ya que la producci n de alimentos para los argentinos queda relegada y se prioriza la exportaci n logrando una escasa distribuci n de los ingresos
1145433 this new funding formula was developed with the input of all 12 of our regional arts partners and represents their joint recommendations
1145434 the purpose was to adjust our regional block grant distributions in such a way to more fairly reflect the geographic size and population of each region as well as its unique cultural needs
1145435 the products we review are the ones that we know work given our experience in the particular field
1145436 will b patrick bauer join kevin mitschelen in the elimination of the gas tax for the residents of the 6th district and the state of indiana
1145437 m s grande y contaminante que tres plantas de celulosa juntas
1145438 imag nese ese enorme pilet n con basura qu mica filtrando en la cordillera donde nacen todos los r os que nos alimentan de agua y que permanecer all por siempre m s all de cuando se vaya la barrick adem s todo en una zona de movimientos s smicos con dos devastadores terremotos en los ltimos sesenta a os
1145439 el drenaje cido subsistir por cientos de a os moviliza metales pesados que contaminan las aguas superficiales y subterr neas
1145440 la intoxicaci n aguda con cianuro puede terminar con la muerte es una sustancia altamente t xica y hay casos de derrames en la industria minera
1145441 pap vivi toda la vida aqu siempre sembr cebolla y nunca le ha faltado el agua el r o j chal siempre trajo agua para todos pero ahora no mire usted coincide con la llegada de la barrick y qu casualidad la barrick saca su agua cerquita de donde nace el j chal
1145442 a nosotros nos dejan sin agua y a la barrick no le cortan nunca ellos en un d a chupan m s agua que todo el pueblo y nunca les cortan imag nese lo que ser con la nueva mina
1145443 el enemigo es muy grande y la contaminaci n que se producir es irreversible a qui n venderemos vino si est sospechado de contaminaci n
1145444 es como otro pa s hasta la gendarmer a hace guardia para ellos
1145445 los glaciares enclavados en san guillermo son f bricas de agua regulan el escurrimiento que forma los r os cura y j chal nicos suministros de riego y agua potable que reciben los delicados cultivos del desierto sanjuanino
1145446 las pasteras cierran se van y la contaminaci n disminuye porque esa contaminaci n es producto del proceso en la miner a se sigue contaminando por siglos s lo por la sola existencia del enorme cr ter de la mina productor de ars nico acidez de agua y otros metales pesados el agua es la m s afectada en ambas actividades pero hay diferencias en las pasteras el r o es fuente inagotable mientras que en las monta as el agua se agota con la desaparici n de los glaciares
1145447 el oro no me lo puedo comer pero sin agua seguro no puedo vivir hasta un loco sabe qu tenemos que cuidar
1145448 sarmiento fue el primer minero en san juan y del pa s
1145449 gran parte de esa inversi n es maquinaria de alto costo bienes privados por los que no pagan ning n tipo de impuesto a la importaci n como s paga cualquier otro tipo de industria y un gran porcentaje de esa inversi n en realidad es gasto que ser pagado por el estado por todos nosotros la ley 24 196 de inversiones mineras legisla que del tres por ciento que la empresa paga de regal as deben deducirse los costos de transporte fletes seguro molienda comercializaci n administraci n fundici n y refinaci n en resumen gran parte de las monumentales obras las paga el estado
1145450 mal podemos denominar exportaci n a la actividad de las empresas mineras el total de sus ventas la realizan al mercado externo y no tienen obligaci n de ingresar las divisas al pa s o sea que todo el dinero proveniente de las ventas queda en el exterior
1145451 facilitar las inversiones privadas en la frontera de ambos pa ses
1145452 la cordillera de los andes est administrada por transnacionales se ha transformado en un tercer pa s ubicado entre argentina y chile las empresas pueden hacer cualquier actividad circular libremente de una punta a la otra perforar la cordillera pasar de uno a otro pa s usar inmensas cantidades de agua de forma irrestricta y no pagar ni un centavo
1145453 los autores del tratado son juristas y t cnicos al servicio de las empresas mineras la legislaci n no es econ mica social ni ambientalmente favorable para ninguno de los dos pa ses las nicas beneficiadas son las empresas
1145454 con el tratado chile y argentina ceden territorio y recursos naturales no hay un aporte real a los pa ses desde el punto de vista pol tico y jur dico ambos pa ses ceden soberan a
1145455 no pagan ning n tipo de impuesto provincial ni tributo municipal es decir ni ingresos brutos patentes sellos habilitaciones ni uso del espacio p blico
1145456 se est n produciendo muertes que son totalmente evitables con atenci n primaria de salud esto revela fallas del estado
1145457 es una tragedia cotidiana que est ntimamente ligada a la p rdida de tierras
1145458 alarmante y la m s grave en salud de los pueblos originarios del pa s
1145459 la situaci n se agrav desde el invierno entre julio y agosto se acentu el problema excede al tema salud incluye lo social la interculturalidad la alimentaci n y los mbitos donde viven
1145460 como en todo lo que refiere al mundo ind gena no hay cifras oficiales rigurosas muchos reci n nacidos ni est n anotados no tienen dni as que es muy probable que haya m s muertes que las registradas
1145461 no es casual que empezamos a morir a partir de la p rdida de territorios de la mano de las sojeras las madereras y papeleras si hay 30 familias sobreviviendo amontonadas en 30 hect reas es obvio que no podr n tener alimentos ni las medicinas naturales que hacen a nuestra forma de vida
1145462 misiones tiene una historia de tierras que explica el drama actual cuando de territorio nacional pasa a ser provincia unas veinti n familias se repartieron todas las tierras
1145463 el modelo extractivo de desarrollo sobre la base de explotar nuestros recursos naturales es una saqueo al pa s pero tambi n es directamente opuesto a nuestro modo de vida para ese modelo de saqueo necesitan nuestros territorios pero nosotros no nos quedaremos de brazos cruzados
1145464 un sistema pol tico y judicial que desobedece las leyes
1145465 venimos a recuperar 625 hect reas que le robaron a nuestra abuela en 1951 somos parte de este lugar
1145466 existen much simas m s disputas territoriales de las que llegan a los medios o a los juzgados imposible estimar
1145467 los gobiernos de hoy tienen la misma ideolog a de los que intentaron nuestro exterminio responden a los mismos intereses que se beneficiaron con la apropiaci n de nuestro territorio
1145468 todos ellos est n asentados sobre territorios ind genas o de campesinos con posesi n de d cadas
1145469 la producci n forestal artificial nos pone frente a un modelo de monocultivo y concentraci n el sector forestal no respeta las normas de preservaci n produce despoblaci n de las zonas y exterminio de gran parte de los recursos naturales
1145470 tenemos la decisi n de ir recuperando lo que leg timamente nos pertenece
1145471 el saqueo hoy se da por los bienes naturales y ah campesinos ind genas y poblaciones rurales nos estamos organizando y estamos dando esa disputa algunas veces nos han desalojado pero hemos vuelto a tomar el campo por el simple ejercicio del derecho no hemos esperado que un juez nos devuelva las parcelas nos hemos organizado hemos ido y retomado las fincas
1145472 en la medida que tomamos conciencia de nuestros derechos y recuperamos nuestra historia vamos a multiplicar los conflictos es un planteo pol tico e ideol gico de todo un gran sector de lucha que no tiene vinculaci n partidaria que no fue cooptado y que va a recuperar lo que le corresponde
1145473 el gobierno provincial alienta cuatro polos productivos la industria del az car y el tabaco el turismo y la miner a todas ellas atentan contra nuestros territorios y nuestra forma de vida
1145474 el avance del modelo agroexportador trajo innumerables conflictos legales a las familias asentadas en las tierras desde hace d cadas los avances tecnol gicos hicieron de las viejas y olvidadas tierras santiague as un bien preciado
1145475 sino el modelo agropecuario origen de los desalojos la represi n y el empobrecimiento de las tierras
1145476 emergencia en materia y propiedad de las tierras que tradicionalmente ocupan las comunidades ind genas
1145477 la ley es un piso para el derecho de los pueblos ind genas pero hay dos cuestiones de aplicabilidad el gobierno debiera difundir la ley y capacitar a los jueces para que la apliquen
1145478 el oro es un lujo in til y sin agua no hay vida
1145479 por este atropello ese yacimiento estar maldito nunca se realizar
1145480 ser sancionado quien anunciando desastres infortunios o peligros inexistentes provoque alarma de modo que pueda llevar intranquilidad o temor a la poblaci n
1145481 ser un desastre peor que cinco plantas de celulosa juntas
1145482 con pascua lama barrick gold ser la empresa l der del sector minero a nivel mundial
1145483 barrick gold es responsable de graves atropellos ambientales sociales culturales y econ micos como producto de sus pol ticas programas y acciones contra los territorios y pueblos de la regi n
1145484 los intereses de barrick y los intereses de las comunidades van unos en contra de otros deja una destructiva herencia ambiental y el agotamiento del agua es una de sus principales consecuencias
1145485 barrick no s lo representa los abusos de una empresa sino los de toda una industria
1145486 tengo cinco hijos siete a os como motosierrista un esqueleto arruinado y un sueldo mensual de 668 pesos ac tiene el recibo de sueldo mire usted no hay derecho
1145487 si usted se queja con el capataz la respuesta siempre es igual si no le gusta puede irse pero a d nde vamo a ir nosotros
1145488 si usted se pelea con un contratista en seguida se los llama a todos los dem s y nadie lo vuelve a tomar entra en la lista negra no consigue m s trabajo eh se lo firmo tendr que irse pal sur
1145489 el rub n el menor de mis hermanos est en la lista reclam la paga de d as de enfermo y ah nom s lo largaron el es cabezadura se fue al sindicato y le fue peor ah nom s entr a la lista negra tuvo que agarrar sus cosas y rajar al sur
1145490 nadie aguanta m s de diez a os ac la columna no aguanta uno se descadera o cuando empiezan los achaques seguro que lo largan sin pagarle un centavo
1145491 los que no tenemos estudio terminamos ac no hay otra
1145492 no es de sol a sol es de luna a luna
1145493 mu oz adalberto es mi raz n no voy a hacerle perder su tiempo se or s lo decirle mi verdad ac no hay ley de trabajo no hay derechos y ni dios hay no hay nada s lo hombres usados como animales para hacer un trabajo bruto
1145494 el tata abuelo y mi padre fueron hacheros tres de mis cuatro hermanos son motosierristas como yo mis hijos seguir n estos pasos quiz s ellos vivan mejor mientras espero eso ojal los porte os se enteren cu nto brazo espalda y sacrificio hizo falta para su papel de computadora
1145495 la mayor parte del gasto los recuperan gracias a la plata del estado todos nosotros a trav s de los gobiernos le pagamos a la corporaci n maderera para que haga un negocio redondo adem s de financiar la destrucci n del medio ambiente de misiones
1145496 con su l gica de maximizaci n del beneficio en el menor plazo posible el sector forestal no respeta las normas de preservaci n produce despoblaci n de las zonas y exterminio de gran parte de los recursos naturales
1145497 en los ltimos a os la pol tica general tuvo un hilo conductor transformar a misiones en una provincia forestal tur stica y energ tica pensando fundamentalmente hacia afuera y apoyando los negocios de grandes inversiones privadas
1145498 cuando hay viento lo rociado cae sobre nuestras cabezas cuando llueve ni le cuento a las dos de la tarde ya estamos con dolor de cabeza y a veces con v mitos
1145499 esa papelera de uruguay con entre r os que tanto hablan en buenos aires
1145500 la empresa creci mucho y trajo nueva tecnolog a como tambi n creci la contaminaci n la tierra y el agua est toda contaminada
1145501 bosque es lo que hab a antes de que arrasaran con el monte misionero la gran variedad de especies nativas que subsistieron en estas tierras por siglos
1145502 los est ndares m s altos del mundo en cuanto a calidad protecci n del medio ambiente y seguridad y salud ocupacional
1145503 destruir el medio ambiente y generar graves riesgos para la salud de la poblaci n
1145504 para un campesino la justicia es la polic a de la zona que criminaliza la pobreza la protesta y la organizaci n de las familias hay una gran desprotecci n pero a partir de la organizaci n ha crecido la concientizaci n y las familias campesinas luchan para que se les respeten sus derechos ponen el cuerpo en la defensa de su tierra protegen su forma de vida
1145505 el 5 de febrero de 2005 hab a reuni n de delegados hac a un calor asfixiante m s de 40 grados viento caliente hab a pasado m s de un mes del alambrado en las aguadas y los animales no pod an tomar agua los loyola estaban desesperados plantearon el caso en la reuni n y pidieron ayuda para sacar el alambrado y abrir paso a los animales y as se hizo
1145506 pero el empresario hizo la denuncia en la polic a la elevaron a fiscal a e imputaron con rapidez mete rica a diez miembros del mcc y a m
1145507 ha habido algunas intervenciones de la justicia muy pocas donde ha sido favorable a las familias ancestrales por lo cual quiero pensar que la justicia funciona pero hay muchos eslabones de esa cadena que bloquean todos los derechos de los m s pobres es una situaci n similar al poder pol tico al que no le cae nada simp tico tener que dialogar con interlocutores tan inc modos como el mcc porque los pol ticos est n acostumbrados a sentarse con otros como los empresarios sojeros o ganaderos que justamente son quienes pretenden las tierras campesinas
1145508 ejercicio leg timo del derecho a la tierra de las familias
1145509 no es justo que las familias campesinas paguen con su tierra con represi n y persecuci n el negocio inmobiliario que se realiza con complicidad de funcionarios de la justicia y del poder pol tico
1145510 estamos acusados por defender la vida campesina para algunos eso pareciera ser un delito
1145511 ya no es una verg enza llamarse campesino es un orgullo que se grita y se canta se pone en afiches y banderas ese es nuestro triunfo
1145512 los campesinos padecen la ausencia de sistema sanitario las dificultades de la producci n las desventajas de la comercializaci n de los productos campesinos en el mercado la sequ a y la injusta distribuci n del agua en la zona de riego
1145513 carencia de energ a el ctrica emigraci n de los j venes el desprecio de la cultura campesina por parte de los otros los desalojos y la falta de acceso a la tierra
1145514 los campesinos me dieron permiso para entrar en sus casas y en sus vidas as descubr junto a ellos que para sobrevivir y vivir dignamente en una geograf a y en una econom a en extremo adversas hay que desarrollar una gran cultura y la campesina es una gran cultura que valora la tierra y su historia la gente y sus luchas
1145515 en un rato todos van a saber que hay gente de afuera
1145516 ya no s si esto es discriminaci n porque es lo que vivo desde que me acuerdo seguro que desde la panza de mi madre que me discriminan
1145517 ac no tenemos derechos el mal no tiene l mites
1145518 sufrieron tanto la discriminaci n que es com n que a los hijos no les ense en las costumbres el idioma las ra ces creen que as los protegen que as no se ensa ar n con ellos
1145519 el sistema judicial argentino tambi n discrimina a los abor genes
1145520 no prioriza los derechos otorgadas por la constituci n nacional de 1994 que debe ser considerada por encima de las dem s leyes del pa s y por eso motivo en casi todos los conflictos de tierras siempre los jueces fallan a favor de los terratenientes de las grandes empresas en lugar de las familias abor genes que tienen posesi n ancestral de las tierras reclamadas
1145521 cuando logramos que llegue electo alg n concejal opositor no tardan en comprarlo con plata o alejarlo con amenazas de muerte
1145522 me la tienen jurada hay lugares donde no puedo pasar tengo que dar toda una vuelta m s larga porque ya me avisaron que si me ven me matan
1145523 no me voy a callar los denuncio por corruptos les grito me llego a sus reuniones y les boicoteo sus cosas yo no dependo de ellos para vivir no me quieren y yo tampoco los quiero a ellos pero bueno ac seguimos no me voy a ir no se las voy hacer f cil

1145537 there is a lot of talk about finding fresh voices but when push comes to shove there are not that many opportunities
1145538 i would not be at all surprised if we find more than one creative voice
1145539 my observation is that a lot of confidence has left the creative space on a day to day basis
1145540 i see really talented people coming in very skittish not knowing what to pitch and what will sell and i see executives trying to figure out where is that nerve to hit

1145570 a taste of the difficulties in coordinating large scale teams and a few insights into the game design creative process
1145571 i know all the problems with him in a dispute with objectivists it would have to be admitted that he was an unregenerate mystic and if his philosophy was ever distilled i never saw it what solzehenitsyns writing is is the biggest spotlight that anyone ever focused on the biggest infestation of human rats and cockroaches in history this is to learn from good and hard and to have done that not from the safety and comfort of the west but right in the middle of the horror commands my highest respect
1145572 letting go doesnt mean giving up but rather accepting that there are things that cannot be

1145577 after effectively managing the states banking and investment portfolio it will be the most important issue for my administration missouri has the highest public tuition in the big 12 conference at the same time the state is under funding higher education it is also eliminating opportunities for students and families to reasonably finance their education the treasurer is positioned as a statewide elected official to contribute and add value to policy discussions that affect missourians missouri needs a leader on higher education and i have the record and ideas we need to make college affordable for all missourians
1145578 state appropriations to missouris public colleges and universities are inadequate to keep tuition at affordable levels
1145579 i would call for the state treasurer to be a member of the missouri higher education loan authority i would then work to return the board to focusing on their original purpose of providing low interest loans we should also look at increasing mohelas bonding capacity to create tuition grants and return borrower benefit programs for qualified students
1145580 the state treasurer can best help by speaking out on the economic importance of adequately funding higher education as the administrator of the state college savings program the treasurer can also help families save for college
1145581 it is and would be very important because the treasurer oversees the states irs section 529 college savings plan the program has been improved in recent years in my opinion particularly with the changeover from management by tiaa cref to the american century and vanguard companies participating families now can choose from among a greater variety of plans and can have confidence in two excellent companies one of which is based in kansas city
1145582 the central problem is that as with other aspects of the economy costs are continually rising
1145583 pore over the 529 plan to see if fees being charged to participants are too high
1145584 by working with the governor to put pressure on the university of missouri board of curators to keep costs down as much as possible
1145585 in light of the current economic conditions a college education may be slipping from the grasp of many families with young children and high goals for those youngsters we must do better as a state in providing educational opportunities at affordable rates in order for the state of missouri to be competitive in todays world economy our higher education system is not designed to be only for the wealthy and we must keep it affordable i have always made education one of my top priorities as evidenced by my three terms on the fox c 6 board of education and i will continue to do so
1145586 the system is very complex and deserves to be thoroughly analyzed prior to proclaiming there is one central problem tuition and related costs are closely related to our national and local economies inflation cost of living geographic location funding resources available and other factors we must focus on solving the problem because our young people are our future and we must provide them the tools necessary to lead future generations
1145587 i will form a higher education task force that will be charged with analyzing the issues and providing possible solutions related to college affordability to be distributed to all state legislators and the governor for action the task force will be comprised of college educators financial professionals college student representatives high school educators elected officials and community leaders from across the state
1145588 the treasurer can help by 1 creating an awareness of the problem 2 assembling a team of experts from across the state to analyze and report on the problem and 3 providing possible solutions to the governor and legislators
1145589 it is and will continue to be a very important issue worthy of a practical solution i was born to a working class family from a young age my parents stressed the importance of education to me through much hard work and dedication i was the first in my family to graduate from college i believe everyone should have the same chance to attend college just as i did as treasurer i will advocate for more state funding for higher education and find ways to improve the states 529 college savings plan so families can save more for college
1145590 unfortunately funding higher education is often viewed as a priority only during good budgetary times it is therefore difficult for higher education institutions to predict from one year to the next what their budget will be when the state cuts funding to higher education for example institutions must make up the financial loss by increasing tuition
1145591 the most 529 college savings program once considered among the best in the country is now considered among the worst due to excessive fees charged to families that reduce the amount they can save for college as treasurer i will review the program and identify ways we can lower fees charged by brokers in transaction costs so our plan is more competitive with other plans offered by nearby states i want to ensure that our families get the best return from their investment

1145598 there are a lot of regulations and rigorous training involved to make something look natural and there is a lot of interest in chinese calligraphy right now
1145599 viewing chinese calligraphy is like listening and dancing to music it gives it a sense of time movement and progression a four dimensional element in art

1145632 the price of gas gives them a good excuse to buy the motorcycle they always wanted
1145633 they still offer 3 9 percent financing for people who dont need it
1145634 but the people who are trying to save money on gas anybody thats marginal the banks are not approving because there might be a recession
1145635 the trend seems to be people who have a bike already and used to ride who are getting their bikes up and running again
1145636 i think the rising gas prices are going to bring more people to discover scooters who wouldnt have discovered them otherwise

1145661 will continue to the end of time since the gospel they handed on is the lasting source of all life for the church therefore the apostles took care to appoint successors
1145662 in order that the mission entrusted to them might be continued after their death the apostles consigned by will and testament as it were to their immediate collaborators the duty of completing and consolidating the work they had begun urging them to tend to the whole flock in which the holy spirit had appointed them to shepherd the church of god they accordingly designated such men and then made the ruling that likewise on their death other proven men should take over their ministry

1145669 i was right there with the guys like always under the tunnel with high fives after the game
1145670 probably just because my routine changed so much going back to oakland
1145671 here in toronto i had my bike down in the tunnel and stayed loose all the time and ready to go in oakland the clubhouse was so far away that i wasnt able to have the bike between innings and keep the body loose i think that definitely had something to do it

1145680 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1145681 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1145682 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects

1145707 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
1145708 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
1145709 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
1145710 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
1145711 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
1145712 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
1145713 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
1145714 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
1145715 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
1145716 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
1145717 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
1145718 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
1145719 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
1145720 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
1145721 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
1145722 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
1145723 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
1145724 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
1145725 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
1145726 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
1145727 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
1145728 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
1145729 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
1145730 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
1145731 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
1145732 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
1145733 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
1145734 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
1145735 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
1145736 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
1145737 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
1145738 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

1145755 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
1145756 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
1145757 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and opening allowing the fbi to now be able to prosecute him for the murders and that it was all my fault and its going to be my fault that they can now get him
1145758 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms

1145760 we are asking citizens and our visitors to pay attention to the weather and use their own judgment as to whether to ride out the storm on the island knowing there will be power outages during the night or tomorrow
1145761 its not going to be a huge issue for anybody in this area

1145765 the u s government never discusses the specific security clearance of an individual employee or military member
1145766 time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis to verify information provided by the security clearance holder and traditional steps to ensure that only the appropriate level of security access is granted largely based on the nature of the persons government job
1145767 a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions and plans
1145768 i dont believe that reviewing a persons medical record is part of a typical security investigation unless there is an indication that theres a concern there
1145769 and the alternative here is to have a much higher level of scrutiny for everybody in the system i dont particularly want investigators going through my medical records if theres not a reason a security related reason to do that
1145770 im really crossing my fingers that itll be a single because its the best song ever

1145851 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui lt 3
1145852 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
1145853 vedi ogni persona ha un suo odore un essenza particolare se chiudessi un alcolizzato in una stanza piena di lattine di birra sgasata le berrebbe senza badarci se invece fosse un alcolista pentito se decidesse di non berle potrebbe riuscirci facilmente ora se poniamo nella stanza un solo bicchiere di liquore invecchiato cento anni il cognac migliore il pi raro di tutti che diffonde ovunque il suo profumo come credi che si comporterebbe il nostro alcolizzato restammo zitti guardandoci negli occhi cercando di leggerci nel pensiero a vicenda fu lui a riprendere il discorso forse non la metafora migliore forse rifiutare il cognac sarebbe facile forse dovrei trasformare il nostro alcolista in un eroinomane cio vorresti dirmi che sono la tua qualit preferita di eroina dissi nel tentativo di alleggerire latmosfera sorrise allistante sembrava apprezzare lo sforzo ecco tu sei esattamente la mia qualit preferita di eroina lt 3
1145854 sembrava esitante ma non in maniera normale non come un uomo che sta per baciare una donna incerto della reazione e della risposta di lei che volesse prolungare quellistante il momento perfetto dellattesa impaziente che spesso meglio del bacio stesso
1145855 bella fino a questo momento il mio sforzo personale nel tentativo di salvarti la vita stato enorme non permetter certo che tu ti metta al volante nel momento in cui non riesci nemmeno a camminare in linea retta oltretutto gli amici non lasciano guidare chi ha bevuto lo sai sorrise della sua battuta sentivo laroma dolce e irresistibile irradiato dal suo petto pensi che sia ubriaca chiesi sei intossicata dalla mia presenza riecco quel ghigno malizioso non ti posso dare torto lt 3
1145856 ti amo dissi e la mia voce era profonda e decisa ti amer sempre succeda quel che succeda
1145857 non la fine linizio e la luce dellalba lt 3
1145858 mi dispiace che ci sia stato un fraintendimento ma bella occupata stasera
1145859 anzi per la verit occupata tutte le sere per chiunque escluso il sottoscritto senza offesa spiacente se la tua serata non andr come speravi lt 3
1145860 cosa devo fare per convincerti non stai dormendo e non sei nemmeno morta sono qui e ti amo ti ho amata sempre e sempre ti amer ho pensato a te visto il tuo volto nei ricordi durante ogni minuto di lontananza dirti che non ti volevo pi stata una terribile bestemmia
1145861 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
1145862 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
1145863 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero
1145864 che un giorno il mio cuore la smetter di cercare di uscirmi dal petto ogni volta che mi sfiori
1145865 e rosso il sole perch stasera stato versato il sangue
1145866 se becco quel ba o me la faccio prima ridare e poi gliela spacco in testa
1145867 se pensi che pensare sia un pensiero pensoso allora pensami pensando che ti penso sempre
1145868 bella arriverei ad odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male
1145869 non sai quanto mi piacerebbe ucciderti ma sono felice che lei stia al caldo
1145870 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo

1145883 james hansen lists the following degrees on his web site i dont see climatology in there
1145884 walt should apologize to no one for having a dissenting opinion
1145885 the problem with agw theorists is they cant adequately defend their theory so they resort to attacking the people who disagree with them much like youve been doing here
1145886 it doesnt help that nasa scientist james hansen was one of the early alarmists claiming humans caused global warming hansen is a political activist who spreads fear even when nasas own data contradict him
1145887 what part of global warming is attributable to human activity and what can humans do to control the earths temperature are scientific questions that cannot be answered without appealing to science and scientific data but when global warming alarmists try to make their case they invariably resort to words dogma opinion and emotion the closest thing to scientific data you will see in any of their articles is the occasional chart showing a poorly understood correlation between co2 and temperature
1145888 unfortunately correlation is not causation if it were real scientists can produce real data from the past 20 000 years showing that temperature peaks have preceded peaks in atmospheric co2 by 100 to 800 years there are standing offers with monetary rewards for one peer reviewed paper showing causality between co2 and increased temperature none exists
1145889 on the other hand scientists who do understand the earths temperature as well as it can be always rebut the alarmists with papers that are replete with facts science charts and data tables
1145890 everybody knows and attacks against fox news and conservative bloggers i also didnt see anything related to a refutation of another fact pointed out by a commenter that the same research and data used by hansen to prove global warming was used in the 70s to predict a coming ice age
1145891 now if the 4870x2 was actually notably faster than the 280 for about the same price then i might even take a chance on it however that wont be the case

1146096 the best full length life of anne boleyn and a monument to investigative scholarship
1146097 the best book on anne boleyn ever written this is a must for all lovers of tudor history academics and general readers alike
1146098 splendidly successful ives boleyn a portrait at all points supported by the evidence he gives is clever independent minded and politically astute ives has gone as far as anyone can in solving the enigma of boleyn in a narrative at once profoundly researched and lively
1146099 eric ives a scholar utterly at home in early tudor politics has been writing about the boleyns for more than two decades his book represents a triumphant culmination of all that research presented with clarity wit and human sympathy
1146100 magnificently researched eric ives has written the finest most accurate study of anne boleyn we are ever likely to possess he leaves no stone unturned in his quest to discover the truth never has the historical anne been so satisfyingly portrayed
1146101 what ives doesnt know about the high politics and court life of henry viiis england will either never be known or is not worth knowing if there is a truth about anne boleyns rise and fall he will tell it to us
1146102 ives demonstrates triumphantly the potential of the biographical approach in a pre modern setting he evinces a deep empathy for his subject without ever becoming an apologist for her and he provides a narrative which is genuinely moving he has also given us a fully rounded and persuasive account of annes life as a whole and its significance for understanding the politics and political culture of the early tudor decades
1146103 as the title clearly indicates this book is a study of the english reformation during the reign of henry viii

1146107 i cannot praise too highly derek wilsons prose style which is masterful and lively he writes with great conviction and a breathtaking attention to the kind of personal detail that makes his books such compelling reading
1146108 the most sympathetic account of henry viiis second wife to appear a skilled writer miss chapman makes the story as readable as it is dramatic

1146254 in reality seeks to modify the social and cultural reality of spain transforming its identity
1146255 this social and cultural project aims to construct a secular society without any moral or religious reference attempting to impose nihilist thought and deliberately eliminating everything catholic from public life
1146256 powerful and sometimes dark forces present everywhere from the media to schools
1146257 thus the church is presented as the enemy of democracy and modernisation opposed to science and progress against freedom the enemy of happiness or the promoter of division confrontation and violence in an effort to isolate religion to private life
1146258 the silencing of god is the fundamental event of our times
1146259 there is nothing else that compares in terms of its radicalism and serious consequences
1146260 nothing can be said to be definitive it is at the center of a society that constantly doubts itself
1146261 there is no law only rights that are restricted or broadened according to the will of whoever is in power in all of this is the concept of man as a being autonomous of the will of god who counts for nothing
1146262 i go to make a deal and i set down the terms and theyre good terms i know how to do it ive been watching this get done for

1146273 i heard somewhere that some people are born like that
1146274 when i got back out i couldnt put them my shit back in order hed tell me to listen to traffic and id see it hed tell me to smell the air and im holding it squeezing it between my fingers like river clay feel the walls and im like eating flavored chalk like i just snorted a line of pixie stix at the end of the class he told me i must have been one of those others the one in 99 who mess everybodys mob up he told me i could never be an actor at best i was just some elevated chimp and he said he was proud of me
1146275 the way he looked at me when he said that it was like the sound glass would make against the wall just this sweet little noise
1146276 when i was little i used to know an angel
1146277 i thought she made the sun set just for me to show me that shed always come down from the sky to take care of me i thought if she ever left something terrible would happen to me but then she disappeared and the sun still set that was worse than dying
1146278 but im glad that someone else can still feel it the way i used to even if angels dont exist

1146301 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
1146302 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
1146303 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
1146304 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
1146305 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
1146306 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
1146307 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
1146308 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
1146309 i look at it this way you dont have to have a heart condition to be a cardiologist and you dont have to be an alcoholic to work as a therapist

1146313 being a hostage places you in a situation of constant humiliation faced with this you can take one of two possible paths either you allow yourself to become ugly and bitter filled with hate and vindictiveness or you follow the other path that is shown by jesus
1146314 he jesus said bless your enemies each time i read the bible i felt those words were directed at me as though jesus were standing in front of me he knew what to say to me
1146315 of course i realised that when your enemy is awful it is hard to live out those words faithfully and therefore i felt like saying the exact opposite when i said these words however it was like magic i felt a kind of relief
1146316 the hatred simply vanished i feel that a transformation took place within me and i owe that change to being able to listen to what god wanted for me
1146317 at the start of my captivity i said to myself you are going to be here for months and months so you might as well read the bible which i had not done previously
1146318 opening it it fell open on the epistles of st paul on the passage which i can recite more or less from memory you may ask for what you will but the holy spirit will ask better as he knows what you truly need
1146319 when i read that i exclaimed my god i know what i want to be free
1146320 later i understood that i had to thank god for taking him because my father would never have been able to endure those six years of suffering

1146367 right now theres such a limited supply of real estate in bermuda
1146368 locals are not able to sell property to non bermudians residence clubs such as the reefs club fill a niche theyre selling to people who want a vacation home in bermuda but dont want the multi million dollar price tag
1146369 the more we researched and asked our guests about fractional ownership the more we realized its ideal for people who want to own something in bermuda dont want the year round responsibilities and want to be able to keep it in the family
1146370 since before we even broke ground the response from repeat guests and their families has been exciting
1146371 and because theyll own a piece of the reefs they can come more often and enjoy the dining the spa and the private beach
1146372 this price point is also attractive to british visitors to bermuda
1146373 because the bermuda currency is tied to the american dollar british tourists are enjoying unprecedented value in addition to the ease of getting here from london thanks to non stop service on british airways from gatwick
1146374 residence clubs are a sensible way to own in any market but especially now that developers have adjusted purchase prices to reflect todays economy the value of residence club vacations exceeds annual ownership costs so owners have real estate equity and save money relative to what they would spend on luxury vacations

1146453 ive reported the cgc to police hundreds of times in the past few years
1146454 they always refused to follow up on my reports saying that mysterious late night deliveries and strange sounds that seem to emanate from underground were not enough evidence to open an investigation
1146455 the worst part was how it never made a sound

1146464 before my second year id already taken depositions argued in court and won a trial
1146465 the partners actually listen to what i have to say
1146466 when she was first born i said theres just no way im going to be able to do this
1146467 and we want to do whatever we can to keep them
1146468 its not just this year that our associates are satisfied with their positions at the firm
1146469 for many years there has been a culture of inclusiveness of our associates that makes them feel respected valued and challenged
1146470 associates grow when given opportunities and challenges to reach higher levels of performance
1146471 people come here in part because they want to do pro bono
1146472 a very important part of the mentoring program is to inform and encourage associates that the reason we recruited them in the first place is they have great minds
1146473 its the respect they find and the understanding that theyve brought value to the enterprise that i think makes them feel very good about the firm and their role in it
1146474 when we recruit associates we want those who have the intelligence and academic record to do the substantive work but also those who fit in with our teamwork type culture
1146475 our size helps create our collegial environment and also helps integrate our associates into the partners practices
1146476 i think that is part of why associates have a quality practice here
1146477 its like working at a small firm but with the mid size firm aspect in terms of the quality of work
1146478 the anonymity that might come from being in a national practice
1146479 were happy being a new england based law firm and we think thats where our opportunity for growth is so thats where were focused
1146480 that being said well still continue to get feedback from associates during our twice a year review process but where were particularly effective is in those informal channels of communication
1146481 with a system of education that puts up the elite good education was never designed for the masses
1146482 this is why were having all these problems in education because the idea at the root of it represents a finite idea that has to end in order for something new and better to come in
1146483 when the children cant see themselves in the education theyre not interested
1146484 there are people coming out of college with degrees that say we have achieved what this world has to offer
1146485 we are seeing the collapse of the economy but look at all the people with a doctorate in economics
1146486 how in the world can you achieve what you want when the headmaster has been disrespected
1146487 the world is looking for change so the brother has struck the right chord
1146488 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
1146489 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
1146490 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
1146491 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
1146492 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
1146493 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
1146494 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
1146495 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
1146496 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
1146497 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
1146498 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
1146499 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
1146500 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
1146501 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
1146502 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
1146503 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
1146504 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
1146505 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
1146506 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
1146507 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
1146508 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
1146509 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
1146510 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
1146511 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
1146512 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
1146513 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
1146514 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
1146515 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
1146516 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
1146517 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
1146518 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
1146519 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs

1146524 first he decided from that day on not to hope any more for the extraordinary happiness that marriage was to have given him and as a consequence not to neglect the present so much second he would never again allow himself to be carried away by a vile passion the memory of which had so tormented him as he was about to propose
1146525 he had often felt that sometimes during an argument you would understand what your opponent loves and suddenly come to love the same thing yourself and agree all at once and then all reasonings would fall away as superflouous and sometimes it was the other way round you would finally say what yourself love for the sake of which you are inventing your reasonings and if you happened to say it well and sincerely the opponent would suddenly agree and stop arguing

1146527 ik hou het publiek een spiegel voor bepaalde redeneringen die mensen maken licht ik uit vergroot ik en maak ik zodanig belachelijk dat mensen er stil bij gaan staan ik kan daar niet zomaar op antwoorden hoe mensen zullen reageren misschien kan het inderdaad dat ze te veel zullen relativeren dan is het zo waarom zou dat niet goed zijn tot nu toe is de enige communicatie over extreemrechts het feit dat het slecht is terwijl als we even stil staan het duidelijk is dat onze maatschappij goed rechts aan het worden is de rechtse zaak is geen marginaal feit meer

1146529 the grant of this patent represents the cornerstone of midatechs nanotechnology ip portfolio and positions midatech as the world leader in the development of nanoparticles for nanomedicine
1146530 this affirmation of our technology by the us patent office puts midatech in an extremely strong position from which to engage in high value international collaborations in order to advance our nanoparticles into the clinic
1146531 the race is on to reduce the cost of optical solutions for short reach interconnects to the level needed by high volume mainstream computing applications
1146532 our vision is to enable high density low cost wavelength division multiplexing wdm transmission by using a single light source for all wavelengths innolumes comb laser we are delighted that sgcm applied ventures and existing investors share our vision and recognize this unique opportunity to access a multibillion dollar market
1146533 this funding will also enable innolume to rapidly introduce to the market novel quantum dot based devices aimed at specific high value medical applications
1146534 since the computer industry has lately committed to merging silicon computing technology with laser powered optical interconnects we are excited that innolumes innovation applies the silicon integration paradigm for the first time to these lasers namely increased functionality and higher performance at lower cost this investment fits our model of identifying true innovators that have the potential to materially impact existing or emerging markets
1146535 over the last years innolume has clearly shown its capability to enable new fast growing applications with its unique technology were pleased that this investment will move innolume into high volume manufacturing and will expand its market presence
1146536 optical techniques such as fluorescent probes can identify and localize features of interest in biological specimens with extremely high sensitivity and specificity but optical microscopy cannot resolve the features structure
1146537 the solution we are developing will allow researchers to use optical techniques to identify targets then transfer the sample and grid coordinates to a tem and automatically navigate to those targets to obtain high resolution images maintaining the sample in a frozen hydrated state throughout the entire process
1146538 tem can provide two dimensional images and three dimensional reconstructions of biological materials with nanometer scale resolution sufficient to resolve the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins and essential features of other macromolecules and molecular complexes
1146539 however without the localization provided by optical techniques finding those molecules is extremely difficult think of it as trying to find a particular string of glass beads in a barrel full of beads with correlative microscopy you can use techniques such as fluorescent markers to light up the string you are interested in and then go back to the same location for a closer look with the tem
1146540 we believe that the guidance we receive from user participants in this innovative development program will significantly enhance the practical value of future correlative microscopy solutions our collaborative approach with mpi of biochemistry and individual researchers demonstrates the importance fei places on interaction with leaders in the field in the design of new products and methods
1146541 the united states loses four percent of the gross national product due to alloy corrosion
1146542 a network of continuous metal nanoparticles allow the carbon to dissolve and diffuse through the protective oxide scales without the need of a crack or a pore
1146543 by examining the oxide scale we find the metal nanoparticles
1146544 if they are eliminated we can create a more corrosion resistant and longer lasting alloy
1146545 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
1146546 the long rod shaped structure of bacteria may help explain why print particles of higher aspect ratios are internalized more rapidly and effectively than lower aspect ratio particles
1146547 if we can design particles that rely on the same mechanisms that nature has perfected for bacteria we may unlock the key for delivering therapeutics more efficiently and effectively to treat and cure disease
1146548 we are delighted to contribute to the important work that professor desimone and his students are undertaking in the field of nanomedicine this work answers key questions about the role of particle shape and size that industry leaders have been asking for some time

1146554 yo creo que el bullying ha existido siempre es lo que antes llam bamos el t pico gandalla el que abusaba del otro el que le robaba el lunch el que empujaba y crecimos con la idea de que as es y hay que aguantarse
1146555 la situaci n de esta problem tica se suscit cuando un investigador noruego analiz por qu se suicidaban los adolescentes y entonces encontr que hab an sido v ctimas de maltrato en el transcurso de su vida escolar
1146556 el 30 de la poblaci n se catalog como v ctima o como agresor tambi n un dato importante que encontramos es que la mayor parte de las agresiones se llevan a cabo en el aula
1146557 antes dec a el maestro entren que voy a dar mi clase ahora el alumno dice no entren no va a dar clase o dice esp rese si va a dar clase pero usted no va a estar al frente
1146558 el bully es un chavo normalmente inseguro aunque a primera vista puede ser alguien muy seguro de s muy pagado de s es alguien inseguro que tiene ciertas situaciones que no puede resolver puede proceder de hogares violentos
1146559 se ha visto que los ni os que son agresores en la escuela tienden a consumir m s sustancias tienen m s robos m s denuncias tienen ese perfil de agresor
1146560 hay un grupo que sigue al bully que es lo que nosotros llamamos testigos y que juegan un papel muy importante porque son finalmente los que le van a dar el reconocimiento que necesita el bully
1146561 si de pronto tengo la posibilidad de ingresar en ese espacio sin fronteras que nos da el internet por ejemplo y aparecer en p ginas como la jaula injuriando insultando amenazando exhibiendo a los dem s eso parece que les da un regocijo todav a mucho mayor
1146562 lo que primero puede suceder y llamar la atenci n de los maestros es a lo mejor datos de baja autoestima o alteraci n de su autoestima bajo rendimiento escolar con situaciones tales como la deserci n escolar y bueno la condici n m s grave es cuando se realiza el intento o se logra el suicidio
1146563 sabemos que eso es muy dif cil porque es ir a contracorriente porque los alumnos manejan c digos de lealtad muy importantes para ellos en los salones de clase
1146564 no me atrever a a marcarlo como una pr ctica generalizada pero si es una pr ctica que nos debe preocupar a todos me parece que la formaci n c vica y tica nos va a ayudar
1146565 to pull through or not pull through that is the question
1146566 our integration of arrays of nanowires that perform separate functions and are made of heterogeneous substances and doing this in a way that can be reproduced on a large scale in a controlled way is a first
1146567 our main objective is a route toward integrated nanowire arrays that we can produce on any substrate even paper and to reproduce them uniformly on a large scale
1146568 to do that over the past two years our group has developed methods of printing nanowire arrays after first growing the nanowires on a donor substrate we transfer them to any desired substrate including paper or plastic
1146569 nanowires grow sticking out in random directions they look like a bad hair day
1146570 is like combing the hair to make it stand up straight
1146571 to fabricate the integrated circuitry we had to position the two kinds of materials at precise locations on the receiver substrate
1146572 the pattern for the device was on a photoresist layer coated on the substrate first we printed the cadmium selenide nanowires onto the substrate then removed the photoresist with acetone leaving the cadmium selenide nanowires exactly where we wanted them we repeated the process for the germanium silicon nanowires
1146573 in the future we can foresee using a variety of different optical sensors to create nanoscale devices sensitive to multiple colors in high resolution
1146574 and thats just the beginning we contemplate printing nanowire sensor circuitry photosensors chemical sensors biosensors not on silicon but on paper or plastic tape this could be used easily and with instant results where spills have occurred or to test air quality or to test for disease organisms almost any use for a sensor that you can imagine
1146575 because they feared being prosecuted should the program be halted and exposed
1146576 ill be rolling out some changes to our crawling indexing and ranking algorithms over the next few days as you know throughout this process you may see some ranking changes and page shuffling in the index but expect the update will be completed soon
1146577 la figura del docente aparece muy devaluada y las nuevas tecnolog as generan un espect culo con otras dimensiones tal vez las agresiones a docentes no sean nuevas pero cambi su amplificaci n el que filma hace como un director de cine plantea que el agresor se apure le dice que tiene poca memoria en el celular la escena entra en la l nea del reality show

1146580 i was standing at the counter i was waiting for the change when i heard that old familiar music start it was like a lighted match had been tossed into my soul it was like a dam had broken in my heart
1146581 in the end theres just a bed and the things we made had begun to fade on the distant shores new voices are risin
1146582 they were so generous with us in terms of their time and the stories theyd tell us
1146583 we sat up one night on the beach and they shared the whole history of the band the struggles they had i got to interview them for something we may do later those guys are a huge part of history whether people realize it or not the music they had a hand in creating is so universal it doesnt matter where you go you can hear the wailers drifting out of some club or shop or car or boat and they are so humble for everything theyve been a part of
1146584 i try to make the album set up the sequence of the songs just like the set list of a show
1146585 i want it to come out just kickin i want you to put it in at the party and not skip just put it in and let it go so we try to just rock it the first two or three like you would on a show then start workin in some ballads then bring it back up rock it some more its a thing of hopefully makin it a sequence that flows so well that people will put it in and leave it in
1146586 i am superstitious and want to know what it means when cats start hanging around your house this isnt about the character from the farrelly brothers hit movie of the same name lance armstrong dumped kate hudson because she was too desperate seems the tour de france champ and cancer survival poster boy was feeling a bit smothered
1146587 no one was going to tell him what to do
1146588 we need to instead teach children and guide them in how to blaze a trail for themselves using appropriate tools and techniques we need to teach children how to live in the jungle rather than in a national park
1146589 buy the 2x trust me itll work out in the end
1146590 then by car we traveled up through the surrealistic twisted oak hills near ukiah past the stunted pines of little river and mendocino where the coast looks like a matching jigsaw piece of japan to kittitas washington p 9

1146608 somebody might smoke crack in the bathroom or have sex
1146609 you can stand up and speak in a meeting in front of the mayor but you wont stand up in your church i think the prompting of the holy spirit was there what would have happened if youd responded you would have stood up and read the passage and sat back down and everybody would have looked at you like you were psycho just like they did with jesus whats the difference

1146847 use of the word obese shuts people down they associate it with 10 tonne mums and half tonne kids we have not banned it but we have chosen not to use it theres no point giving them a letter that does not have any impact on their behaviour
1146848 i find this particular line from the government to be tiptoeing through the daffodils
1146849 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice its a nasty word but by god it should sound alarm bells in parents minds
1146850 i find this whole approach from the department of health a bit prissy and namby pamby
1146851 school nurses can make a real difference in helping children develop healthy habits but the government has failed to address the chronic shortage of school nurses
1146852 if ministers are serious about their plans to tackle child obesity then they should use this opportunity to really highlight the health risks it causes
1146853 unless these letters are accompanied by practical help then they will be a waste of time and resources
1146854 a very cute little girl grabbed my leg and asked where are my parents where are my brothers
1146855 i saw her parents and brothers were on a plane that was set to take off in three minutes
1146856 i ran quickly because i knew that every minute mattered at the same time the police tried to contact the flight attendants to get them to stop the plane when i reached the gate the plane was no longer there
1146857 she loves everything about the area where she lives shes not going to get married at some luxury resort in the caribbean or a hotel in beverly hills

1146861 honey i just heard the news dont worry youll meet a nice girl soon wholl do naughty dances for you but maybe it wouldnt hurt to lower your expectations a little do you remember that sweet girl who lived down the street and murdered her whole family i hear shes single smooches
1146862 he is also not at fault for indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull
1146863 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at anytime in the future
1146864 during the temporary conservatorship the conservators have the power to insure that lutfi will not harm britney anymore if mr lutfi makes any future attempt to contact britney after the temporary conservatorship has concluded britney has made clear she will take all appropriate legal action
1146865 the vehicles purchased by the plaintiff and the other class members were not as unique or rare as the defendants had stated them to be
1146866 their value from scarcity and as collectors items were and are dramatically less than the buyers had been led to believe their value would be
1146867 this is a call to action to call for male circumcision its been two years and still there is not enough money focus to scale up effort and more needs to be done
1146868 there is no national male circumcision campaign to promote it more education is needed
1146869 we found that there was no difference between the circumcised men and uncircumcised men that there is no increase in sexual dysfunction in circumcised men and in fact circumcised men did report greater penile sensitivity after circumcision
1146870 the regulators should investigate themselves for bailing out fannie mae and freddie mac the creditors of bear stearns and the financial system with new lending facilities they have swapped u s treasury bonds for toxic securities it is privatizing the gains and profits and socializing the losses as usual this is socialism for wall street and the rich
1146871 of three dozen or so medium sized regional banks a good third are in distress
1146872 at a time when scores of companies are freezing pensions for their workers some are quietly converting their pension plans into resources to finance their executives retirement benefits and pay in recent years companies from intel corp to centurytel inc collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank and file pension plans this lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives supplemental benefits and compensation
1146873 royal amp sunalliance an insurer sold a division and laid off its 228 employees in 1999 just before doing so it amended the divisions pension plan to award larger benefits to eight departing officers and directors one human resources executive got an additional 5 270 a month for life but to do this and still pass the irss nondiscrimination tests the company needed to give tiny pension increases to 100 lower level workers said the companys benefits consultant pricewaterhousecoopers one got an increase of 1 92 a month joseph gromala a middle manager who stood to get 8 87 more a month at age 65 wrote to the company seeking details about higher sums other people were receiving a lawyer wrote back saying the company didnt have to show him the relevant pension plan amendment
1146874 some lower level people will lose benefits too chester madison a middle manager who retired in 2002 after 33 years saw his pension fall to 20 400 a year from 49 200 mr madison 62 has taken a job selling flooring in sacramento calif
1146875 i look at it as greed and taking care of the top echelons
1146876 most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1146877 the gas prices that are wiping out your pay cheques and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state
1146878 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1146879 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1146880 we should sell 70m barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1146881 appears to be no good evidence that broken windows policing reduces crime nor evidence that changing the desired intermediate output of broken windows policing disorder itself is sufficient to affect changes in criminal behaviour
1146882 with mr rodgers again providing the copia and mr hammerstein providing the corn

1146885 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1146886 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1146887 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1146888 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1146889 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant

1146891 explicitly believe in addressing a breach in one of societys central relationships between the top and bottom rich and poor
1146892 we have pledged to share the proceeds of growth so that government grows more slowly than the trend rate of the economy so government spending will fall as a proportion of gdp
1146893 subjected to a barrage of mailings phone calls and emails
1146894 the beautiful but narrow 30 mile drive along the edge of the yorkshire dales from the m6 to skipton every lay by along the a65 except two will be closed as they dont meet new eu size guidelines in the past thoughtful farmers kindly caravanners and hgv drivers have pulled in to let motorists pass were worried about accidents due to impatience so dont fret relax and enjoy the scenery there will be fewer places where the police can safely pull you in for speeding were that not all but impossible because of tractors caravans and trucks

1146897 gaza is a virtual prison for well over a million palestinians its been under siege almost continuously for two years israel says it no longer occupies the gaza strip so the boat will not be asking permission from israel and will not allow israel to board the boats
1146898 as a doctor there is nothing more sad for me than watching my patients dying
1146899 the idea is when we get to gaza we have broken the siege
1146900 to seek clearance for anything they say that draws on the experience they had in their entire careers
1146901 would among other things prevent any live tv or radio commentary from former diplomats for the rest of their lives they would thus substantially diminish informed discussion of major world events
1146902 the suggestion that diplomats should not say or write or in any way express views which may draw on their whole professional experience is very far reaching i think it may also be unenforceable
1146903 freedom of information means it is not up to the government to decide what information is made public and what stays private yet there seem to be different rules for memoirs if i were a minister or a civil servant writing my memoirs i would think it was reasonable for government to suggest changes i should make for public interest reasons but not for it to censor me
1146904 how much would it cost to redo the whole line in spots
1146905 we are sending out requests to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
1146906 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game

1146910 my god my wife is sleeping how can i share this news with anybody
1146911 the heart attacks you see on tv and in the movies arent what many of us actually experience
1146912 because it is not what they think a heart attack is like people decide to sleep on it or wait a bit
1146913 oh my god i saw a man carrying a girl
1146914 almost certainly need to operate without fully knowing the factual background
1146915 far from being a system of check and balances this is a recipe for confusion that places on parliament tasks that it cannot effectively fulfil and arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1146916 this report is another nail in the coffin of a bill which is unnecessary and which undermines the liberty of every man and woman in the country

1146920 the idea is when we get to gaza we have broken the siege
1146921 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample
1146922 what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1146923 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1146924 this information will be considered by the lawyers and by the private investigators who are still looking for madeleine
1146925 anybody reading it needs to do so in the context of kate and gerrys arguido status having been lifted
1146926 the search for madeleine goes on kate and gerry are realistic they know there is a possibility that madeleine could be dead and could be long dead however there is absolutely no evidence that she is dead and because of that total absence of evidence they have to cling to the hope that she could well be alive
1146927 to seek clearance for anything they say that draws on the experience they had in their entire careers
1146928 would among other things prevent any live tv or radio commentary from former diplomats for the rest of their lives they would thus substantially diminish informed discussion of major world events

1146930 freedom of information means it is not up to the government to decide what information is made public and what stays private yet there seem to be different rules for memoirs if i were a minister or a civil servant writing my memoirs i would think it was reasonable for government to suggest changes i should make for public interest reasons but not for it to censor me
1146931 appears to be no good evidence that broken windows policing reduces crime nor evidence that changing the desired intermediate output of broken windows policing disorder itself is sufficient to affect changes in criminal behaviour
1146932 negative emotions and tensions between the new eu immigrants and local communities
1146933 the newspaper wishes to make clear that it wasnt in any way anti polish
1146934 we are pleased that the daily mail could see that some of the wording they had in their headlines was harmful and they have taken far more care
1146935 the community is in shock not so long ago there was this very happy event with two lovely people and two lovely families and then out of the blue comes this sad news its very difficult for people to handle
1146936 ben was a conscientious student he was professional at all times he took on responsibilities beyond those required of him
1146937 he was valued by all he came into contact with both at university and in the clinical setting
1146938 ben was caring articulate and dedicated to his chosen profession
1146939 he will be greatly missed our condolences go to the families of ben and catherine
1146940 i am anxious to impose a sentence that restricts your liberty you still go to the pub where you went with your wife that must annoy her relatives not being able to go there will be a more meaningful disposal than a prison sentence which will not last long
1146941 it just shows the tragic level of authoritarianism when the police are cracking down on a group of people who simply want to get together to discuss the most important issue facing the world
1146942 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think their child is a healthy weight
1146943 this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1146944 we have to get the balance right between being a nanny state and a neglectful state

1146951 unless these letters are accompanied by practical help then they will be a waste of time and resources
1146952 etss problem masks a more endemic massive failure of sats that runs right through the system this is vanity testing so government can feel good about whats happening in primaries and show results are improving but its expensive for primaries not trusted by secondaries and damaging for children
1146953 there is an issue wider than the problems with ets school test results are not a reliable indicator of pupil performance
1146954 we are considering a boycott but some naht members think that wouldnt be a professional response despite the strength of feeling against sats
1146955 i have sympathy with that view but if you got to the point where there is a head of steam throughout the education community against sats and the response from the government is that there will be absolutely no negotiations then eventually you come to a situation where only a very strong campaign will have an effect
1146956 tests have changed several times over the period theyve been around trying to assess standards across the system over time using these tests is of relatively little value if you want to know how a system is performing you only need to test a sample not every 11 and 14 year old in the country
1146957 it is a tragedy that hundreds of thousands will join the millions who have left primary school unable to master the basics in the 3rs basics that are the keystone of future opportunity and success
1146958 standards in our schools are rising and we do not accept that this is the result of teaching to the test
1146959 we are already trialling changes to testing which allow teachers to choose when their pupils take new single level tests
1146960 after we turn it on you may hear a slight pop followed by some not unpleasant vibrations unless you are in switzerland in which case be sure you are wearing clean underwear

1146963 people have opinions they have perspective one of the things that create expertise is your perspective
1146964 theres a distinction between total subjectivity and context that you can provide because you have experience and you speak with authority because of that experience i think journalists shy away from speaking with authority and that they ought to speak with it
1146965 its like obscenity you know it when you see it and you rarely do

1146970 the dow jones india titans 30 index includes 30 largest and most liquid stocks traded in india the selection to the index will be based on rankings by float adjusted market capitalisation and 12 month average daily trading volume
1146971 the growing importance of india to the world and to dow jones and news corporation is obvious to all what the world needs is a trusted means of measuring this countrys development and an index that can be used by investors around the world to track the progress of indian companies and the indian economy
1146972 we will see huge capital flows both from and to india in coming years and that is an opportunity for us as a financial information company and for international investors who want to take advantage of this profound trend
1146973 he had a conservative and retrograde view of looking back to russias roots idealizing the purity of sprit and making it the center of the russian universe that was his dream
1146974 he was totally uncompromised in this attempt and it was difficult for both liberals and conservatives to be his following to the liberals his conservative views about russias his anti western views his sharp criticism of the west was something they could not accept to the conservatives his call his claims he lay on the nation were somehow too rigorous something that the conservatives may like to listen to but could not live up to he will remain a figure of gigantic proportion maybe too big for the modern world
1146975 played a decisive role in bringing down the totalitarian system
1146976 because there were a lot of issues that could not be evaluated unequivocally as for his writing he undoubtedly contributed a lot to literature
1146977 i am giving up smoking under persuasion from my children they dont like the habit if they did not have any objection i might have continued smoking i consider their pressure as a blessing
1146978 i thought of quitting smoking first while flying back from a foreign trip that was non stop flying for 17 hours i did not feel restless at all when i landed in mumbai i felt like lighting a cigarette only when i got in my car that too was just a feeling
1146979 want some ice cream i know exactly where to go
1146980 hes a strong and decisive character who will lead from the front
1146981 a very determined player who will do a fantastic job
1146982 kp knows his game very well he is a cricket geek everything that has been thrown at him he has dealt with brilliantly
1146983 he is very single minded and has confidence by the bucketload
1146984 he does all these weird and wonderful shots but he works really hard practising them in the nets
1146985 he was a great captain who deserved to go out on a high i hope weve not seen the last of him as a batsman
1146986 we know from experience such committees are nothing but eyewash we dont want committees we want a written government order agreeing to our demand
1146987 it is a question of their career they are missing classes and i appeal them to stop the ceasework and join classes immediately they should not force the government to take any action
1146988 i dont know if i have the energy to take the battle ahead to appeal to the supreme court i shall have to see what the court has said i now feel our whole fight was useless
1146989 i am not strong enough to handle this i have lost my courage i dont kow who to blame god society or the system but i believe in god it was god who gave me haresh such a good husband and again it was god who gave me the baby i don t know what went wrong
1146990 i found i was pregnant when i was one and a half months into it
1146991 i was speechless i said wow did we do this
1146992 i was so excited i started shopping for the baby i even decided which school s he would go to it had to be an icse school i wouldn t miss a single date with the gynaecologist
1146993 we had plans i even started yoga to keep fit
1146994 its not that i would deliver the baby now only to give it away
1146995 i am not heartless my childs not a burden but it is less painful to end it now rather than see your child in front of you our doctors said the foetus could have a blocked heart and malpositioned arteries and it could prove risky one of them even told us that there could be sudden death and the pacemaker surgery could be risky for a new born
1146996 it is as if we are a democracy but we don t have a right to decide about our own life this fight has drained me mentally and emotionally i dont even look after my house and don t feel like taking all my medicines and food regularly and enthusiastically
1146997 my parents and in laws support us but i will have to now stop working we are not that rich to afford full time nannies finances will certainly be one concern but what is disappointing is that we have been proved to be fools we are educated fools people in remote areas go to quacks for an abortion the lesson here being sent out is don t follow the law we are being punished for being law abiding citizens
1146998 well i guess im just going to have to make this happen
1146999 hagar a filthy maid can get pregnant and you cant what does that make you
1147000 she thinks shes better than you did you hear the tone of her voice just now did you see the look she just gave you

1147002 i bet abram enjoyed being with her he probably loves her someone who can give him a child
1147003 india and afghanistan are facing the challenges of terrorism of cold blooded brutal murderous activity in our two countries and we recognise that the two countries and the world at large have no option but to be united in fighting the menace of terrorism as it affects us and as it affects the international community
1147004 as india has suffered immensely from this menace afghanistan has too therefore it is a moral responsibility for us not a political activity i would like to underline it is a moral responsibility for us as human beings to protect the lives of our women and children and to prevent the loss of life caused by terrorism by defeating terrorism and by eliminating it completely and thereby bringing security to our peoples and the world at large

1147080 mi trovo a vivere il grande sogno che in tanti vorrebbero vivere non mi sarei aspettata di avere tanto successo prima con xfactore poi con il pezzo tante persone che non hanno che non hanno seguito il programma mi hanno conosciuta attraverso la radio sentendo il mio pezzo
1147081 lavoravo part time allesselunga per guadagnarmi da vivere visto che i repertori musicali rock che facevo non mi davano tale possibilit
1147082 essendo ariete una componente del mio carattere la determinazione la voglia di riuscire
1147083 se arriver ad avere successo quando sar pi grande sar ancora pi bello perch avr la maturit per godermi il momento
1147084 a 23 anni ho iniziato a scrivere delle canzoni musica e parole e allora mi sono iniziata a proporre alle case discografiche ed ho iniziato a prendere la cosa sul serio
1147085 e nata grazie allattenzione di tiziano nei miei confronti attraverso x factor da subito ha pensato a dei brani per me sono stata una fonte di ispirazione
1147086 per la verit molto diverso dai miei inediti ma molto in sintonia con il percorso che ho fatto in x factor ascoltando il brano non ti scordar mai di me mi sono resa conto di quanto fosse vicino al mondo musicale interpretato nel programma vicino ai brani retr anni 60 che ho cantato in trasmissione e poi tratta un tema sentito quello degli amori che finiscono mi ha esaltato questo ruolo di interprete che non avrei mai pensato io volevo propormi come cantautrice ed infatti quando dovevo partecipare ad x factor ero titubante per il fatto di dover cantare delle cover poi ho deciso di partecipare perch sapevo che a fine trasmissione potevo cantare un inedito il mio percorso poi si sviluppato come non mi sarei aspettata e fare linterprete di grandi autori come gabriella ferri ora mi affascina tanto
1147087 un bel rapporto e nel mio cuore e nei miei pensieri mi riprometto di chiamarla quanto prima durante il programma ci siamo confrontate le ho fatto sentire le mie canzoni e una persona che rimarr nella mia vita
1147088 il mio vero nome giuseppa gaetana ferreri sono i nomi delle nonne ma sul certificato di nascita c scritto solo giuseppa ferreri gaetana comunque un nome che si addice alla mia personalit robusto e mascolino penso di aggiungerlo
1147089 si ci sono andata tre volte dopo x factor anche perch loro non sapevano che avevo fatto i provini per il programma non mi sono pi presentata al lavoro sono andati i miei genitori a direche non sarei pi andata a lavorare perch ero stata presa in trasmissione
1147090 si certo mi capitava di canticchiare e di scrivere sugli scontrini la melodia che avevo in testa la scrivevo subito per non dimenticarla mentre il cliente magari finiva di sistemare la merce comprata in busta

1147092 si dopo essere stata single per un anno e mezzo ma non voglio parlare della mia vita privata lui fuori dai riflettori e quindi giusto rispettare la sua privacy

1147199 al frankens campaign is in trouble and everyone knows it including al franken franken has now hit a new low by creating a fake document with a presidential seal to mislead minnesotans about his false negative attacks on norm coleman franken wants minnesotans to believe this is a real document to give his false attacks the credibility they lack franken claims he wants to talk about the issues but then fabricates a phony forged white house document that doesnt exist the truth is norm coleman has been one of the nations most independent minded senators a fact recognized by non partisan experts like congressional quarterly and the washington post as he falls further behind in the polls franken cant defend his own record of not paying taxes not paying workers compensation and joking about rape so now hes just making stuff up
1147200 however the campaign released a statement from frankens accountant allen chanzis who said his office sent a letter to the state of california in 2003 asking it to remove afi from its tax records as afi will no longer be doing business in california
1147201 however state records show that chanzis filed corporate disclosure forms for afi with the california secretary of states office in 2004 and 2006 franken staffer andy barr said he didnt know enough about the matter to explain the possibly conflicting documents

1147204 it is worth noting that franken lies when it is convenient im not making an incendiary charge here franken is very upfront about this himself he demonstrates it in a chapter about how he had one of his research assistants pose in a trip to bob jones university as a high school student interested in attending the school franken goes along with him and lies about being a friend of the students family franken in an excessive bout of modesty titles this chapter im a bad liar actually he seems pretty good at it

1147249 esta huelga no muestra m s que el af n que tienen de parar el revocatorio es un accionar pol tico y esa es la verdadera intenci n de los c vicos
1147250 estamos esperando que las federaciones se aproximen a la superintendencia de transportes y presenten su sustento para que la superintendencia las eval en vea si proceden o no y si proceden en qu proporci n trabajo que lo hicimos desde principio de a o algunos lo hicieron y otros no pero no podemos manifestarnos sin esa evaluaci n econ mica y no vamos a emitir una autorizaci n sin la previa justificaci n de los transportistas

1147253 ante la proximidad del referendo revocatorio convocado para el 10 de agosto por el congreso nacional mediante ley es la nica alternativa legal y leg tima que permitir clarificar el verdadero sentir de la mayor a del pueblo boliviano mediante una instancia de participaci n libre y democr tica sin presiones ni amenazas

1147257 initial meca analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1147258 while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1147259 this is surprising since an earlier tega measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1147260 when surprising results are found we want to review and assure our extensive pre launch contamination control processes covered this potential

1147274 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1147275 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate

1147289 he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery

1147294 its small time its got a poor return its very risky and its a crowded market and thats why im going to invest 111lol
1147295 his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story
1147296 he was not drunk he was drinking hours and hours before
1147297 we are not going to comment on whether there is a criminal investigation
1147298 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1147299 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1147300 i have daughters and ive been thinking about this a lot and if they were faced with this decision i decided that at the end of the day i just want them to be happy
1147301 do you think theyd be happy as part of the undead

1147309 so jet to the store and buy the lp on j i v e unfortunately
1147310 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life
1147311 we once again ask that the press respect his privacy and that of his family
1147312 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
1147313 the bicycle has been responsible for more movement in manners and morals than anything since charles the second under its influence wholly or in part have wilted chaperons long and narrow skirts tight corsets hair that would come down black stockings thick ankles large hats prudery and fear of the dark under its influence wholly or in part have bloomed weekends strong nerves strong legs strong language knickers knowledge of make and shape knowledge of woods and pastures equality of sex good digestion and professional occupation in four words the emancipation of women
1147314 a oltre quarantanni di distanza dalla sua invenzione il laser continua a creare intorno a s unatmosfera mista di curiosit e meraviglia la curiosit essenzialmente alimentata dal fatto che nuovi tipi di laser vengono ancora oggi inventati e nuove affascinanti persino impensabili applicazioni vengono continuamente introdotte il senso di meraviglia cui non si sottrae anche il lettore meno informato deriva soprattutto dal carattere pervasivo del laser non esiste infatti campo della scienza e della tecnica che non sia stato influenzato a volte in maniera rivoluzionaria da questa invenzione
1147315 capita a volte che i grandi nascondano una passione che nulla ha a che vedere con le loro attivit ma che per loro ha altrettanta importanza
1147316 gli scienziati fanno le cose che riescono a fare quando si accorgono di disporre dei mezzi per studiare qualcosa che fino a quel momento era stato trascurato allora simpegnano per quella strada
1147317 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
1147318 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
1147319 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
1147320 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
1147321 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
1147322 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
1147323 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
1147324 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
1147325 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
1147326 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1147327 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
1147328 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1147329 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
1147330 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
1147331 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
1147332 this record felt like and still feels like from the writing to the recording a reclaiming of my own independence
1147333 you begin to get yourself hung up on other peoples expectations and i dont think i do my best work when i think about what other people might think of the work im doing when you do that i think the process is robbed of its freedom a little bit so i kind of found my way to an independent streak on this record i was making the songs for the songs themselves and for me alone i never played them for anyone else and i didnt obsess about them too much id write a song and move on so theres a truthful feeling to the album
1147334 when i make a record i finish it and i sit with it for a little while and inevitably ill write a couple more songs and its happened just about every time those other songs really shape the record and almost every time theyve had the title track of the record
1147335 to me its a rock record in the vein of people that ive always loved like weezer or the pixies but i guess those bands have great pop sensibilities but to me i view them as rock bands
1147336 if rock is popular at the time it becomes pop and i embrace pop music but it doesnt sound poppier to me so i just dont know if it is or it isnt ill take it if it is though because i think people enjoy that
1147337 hes a fine producer in his own right and id never worked with a producer who had written their own songs and had success with them
1147338 so i thought that that gave him a unique perspective on what i was doing and i thought he might work as a good sounding board for the songs ive got he taught me a lot because he has a great sense of melody
1147339 im writing about the journey i have been on and my life has taken me in some weird directions
1147340 some have been great some have been hard and i looked to those things and to the people that surround me and have drawn stories out of those experiences thats the one thing when you write about what you know as long as you keep living your life you dont run out of creative impetus
1147341 when i get older i will be stronger theyll call me freedom just like a waving flag
1147342 and do you really want to hold my dirty hands
1147343 het was een hoogtepunt om opnieuw met haar te werken
1147344 de eerste sc ne was geweldig we hadden meteen weer die chemie te pakken
1147345 they had to use the jaws of life hydraulic cutters to extract him from the vehicle
1147346 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1147347 het was aan het begin van onze relatie en we waren op weekend in vancouver we konden niet van elkaars lijf blijven die sauna zou me niet klein krijgen ik kwam er gauw weer bovenop maar tea draaide van haar stokje
1147348 would be outraged to know she was not given that right of first refusal
1147349 she is the only woman in history who has ever garnered this much support
1147350 she is the only woman in history who was able to raise the kind of money one would need to run a presidential campaign
1147351 is now seen as the reigning dean of the womens movement its sort of moses gets all the way to the mountain and doesnt get to the promised land and i think there would be people really angry about that
1147352 were going to shove a bunch of 30 second ads up his a on this issue over the course of the campaign
1147353 poor bob schaffer just cant stop sabotaging his own campaign
1147354 we know this is a difficult time for wadhams august 11 is the two year anniversary of george allens macaca moment and the memory alone must be causing dick to break out in hives we can only assume that bob schaffers friends on the far right will be disappointed with his campaigns sleazy comments this sort of obscenity has no place in a campaign that should be about the issues
1147355 staying positive is a disservice to the voters because differences between the candidates are never revealed
1147356 we have never had a time in this country where more of the wealth of the country transferred from the middle class of this country to one industry
1147357 theyve allowed us to become captive to the middle east
1147358 jim risch draws a very distinct line between legitimate media and the bloggers that are left wing hatemongers
1147359 the blogging done by legitimate media sources are not in the same category as the left wing hatemongers he considers the legitimate media legitimate regardless of the medium used to convey news
1147360 are you better off than you were four years ago
1147361 in kansas if you position yourself as a moderate republican in the primary you may as well say im also on a suicide mission
1147362 once you get to the general thats something you may want to work on
1147363 what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him
1147364 i cant resist the manly twinkle in his eyes when he mispronounces nuclear
1147365 and the interesting timing of campaign contributions from its top executives first as markos linked in the this tidbit
1147366 yo can i take it back to where it all started
1147367 it was hard for me to perform the first song because when i see 100 000 people singing along theres only one person i could think of whos missing tonight
1147368 this performance is for my mama the woman who drove me to chicago at the age of 3 and said baby
1147369 they keep claiming that this property is theirs and it is not theirs they keep wanting to buy me but i dont want to sell it i dont know if whether they are trying to push me out i dont know
1147370 its a ridiculous accusation the fire was started by someone as we slept thankfully the lord our god keeps us in all our ways the noise that they made the fire was so big and voluminous the popping and cracking woke people up
1147371 i used to give a f now i give a f less what do i think of success it sucks
1147372 use the stove to heat us powdered eggs and government cheeses the calendars with martin jfk and jesus

1147378 this is a pioneering course that addresses a real need for leaders who are knowledgeable about what it takes to make a success of business in the vast opportunity filled markets on the continent the uct gsb has recognised this need and with this elective we aim to make a contribution to producing a generation of leaders who are ready and able to not only contribute to business success in african markets but also to the socio economic development of the continent
1147379 frank theyll pay you for this or give you another bar for your uniform fruit salad
1147380 contrary to popular belief among some market commentators sales are still happening particularly for those agents and agencies who have the experience and resources to adapt to current market conditions and who are able to attract serious qualified buyers to their varied selection of excellent stock
1147381 barack obama stood up at a speech recently and said that one of the things that is really important from energy policy from his standpoint is to check the pressure in our tires so heres a tire gauge and you can go out in the parking lot here and check your tires now thats an interesting thing we want you to have good pressure in your tires you know it will very mildly add to your fuel efficiency but checking the air pressure in your tires is not an energy policy for the united states of america
1147382 if allah permits us oh nation of mohammed even the stone will say oh muslim

1147386 if jonathan calder didnt exist wed probably have to invent him
1147387 i dont know what we did wrong i mean we dumped on print and favoured tv right
1147388 normally that wouldve made print really keen like but instead we got no press at all well some bad press but they refused to go home with the key marketing message if you know what i mean
1147389 big client was getting really hacked off about this and the journos whinged to that external comms bitch who shouldve been fired years ago for meddling anyway
1147390 it was looking really bad because if we lost that bit of business well that was like 90 per cent of our billings
1147391 so we had a brainwave which we usually do under duress we work great when in stressful situations you see we decided to show the big client how much we loved them i mean really sincere and true
1147392 we headed off to big clients offices and stood on the pavement outside and waved signs and shouted
1147393 it didnt work quite as we hoped because big client ceo wasnt in the building at the time so he didnt see us only that comms bitch you know the one who shouldve been fired
1147394 we were pretty sure afterwards the business was safe but
1147395 thats what you get for trying to be creative sad eh
1147396 the universe bows down to the power of women blogging
1147397 it takes a village not just to raise a child but to nourish the adult
1147398 writing is not about the words its about connecting brains together
1147399 how you think about writing is as important as the writing itself its about the process
1147400 i think better through conversation i dont have to know the answer up front
1147401 blogging is like the mob i try to get out and they pull me back in
1147402 weve been married eight years and everything we have we have together
1147403 assuming there is actual enforcement of an existing provision of the sex offender statute its purpose is to protect the most innocent of victims georgias children
1147404 there is indisputable evidence that convicted sex offenders have a propensity to re offend
1147405 wendy whitaker is not now and has never been a threat to anyone
1147406 the state of georgia has better things to do than to evict a woman from her lawfully purchased home because she had sex as a teenager
1147407 there have been no federal appropriations for cash payments or guarantee subsidies

1147411 les guste o no nuestra solidaridad les ha permitido superarnos a los catalanes en calidad de vida y es de mal nacidos no reconocerlo
1147412 el expolio fiscal que sufre catalunya es tan excesivo que permite que ciudadanos de la rioja o extremadura reciban m s euros en inversi n sanitaria que los catalanes

1147418 oh a lot we sneak them back in your arsenal and you use them to rip each others limbs but they jam time and again and your critical and tide turning murder missions fail
1147419 more people will die more ammunition wasted more money burned your doing achieves nothing

1147443 1 0 for me before i even went to the site and no offense to engineers since i am one myself but i have this feeling call it a hunch that it was most certainly one of the engineers who came up with that last season name either that or it was this guy

1147446 lakach yaakov es kol asher lavinu meiasher lavinu assa es kol hakavod hazeh
1147447 gran escritor y un testigo moral que atrajo la atenci n del mundo sobre los demonios del gulag

1147449 omdat zij doet wat ik wil doen handwerken meer bepaald breien en erover bloggen ook bij mij blijft het nog altijd bij ik zou willen en ik zou eens moeten quilten haken maar de praktijk volgt niet
1147450 where do you see this happen in real life was there a time in your life when you were in a similar situation how did you handle it how could you have handled it differently
1147451 our priority has been to map out a mobile technology path that ensures telecom will offer customers the best possible coverage devices and services available in the near and long term
1147452 our approach is to offer customers the best from current cdma technology and in the future too as wcdma is deployed
1147453 by leveraging the capabilities of both cdma and wcdma we will maintain our capacity to provide new zealanders an unrivalled range of mobile products and services
1147454 worldmode is an example of how we can leverage both types of network technologies to deliver unmatched international roaming coverage
1147455 so it is simply not believable for them to say that they would not privatise key assets like kiwibank and you can probably add to that kiwirail the share in air new zealand the electricity soes and another long list of important state assets
1147456 i havent the slightest idea anymore than id know if tapes at closed sessions of the labour party conference in april were from national party plants
1147457 where after nine years in opposition the national partys big idea is to go and borrow some more money and then theres the same old agenda of hacking into core public service spending and privatising key state functions like the management of prisons and the threat to put more of the healthcare out to the private sector we already know about their plans for putting more money in the way of private education we now hear of the secret plans around the sale of assets like kiwibank
1147458 for a political party to go out on a programme of simply borrowing more money in the middle of an international financial market crisis would have to be about the silliest idea ever invented
1147459 for keeping that debt to gdp ratio conservative because new zealand has other factors like a persistent current account deficit which dont impress financial markets
1147460 that the national party will announce it is going to chuck more money at infrastructure and yet cannot answer any direct question about what that money would go on one thing we can guarantee it will go on is building more prisons because the corrections policy announced by their spokesperson on the weekend is a recipe for investing a lot more in that rather futile area of public spending
1147461 i suspect theyll be looking at private prisons in the same way not with the state building them and asking others to operate them but actual private prison building
1147462 es muy malo tener que ver por la televisi n jugar a la selecci n ol mpica mi voluntad era estar junto con todo el grupo pero el real madrid no me quiso liberar lo lamento mucho
1147463 la temporada s lo est comenzando ahora y tengo propuestas de otros clubes como el chelsea pero nada est seguro estamos conversando
1147464 our unique selling point is fairly clear actually for a number of reasons expertise service technology were the world leader for wcdma gsm deployments as in we have the most commercial deployments in the world which seems to refute the too expensive claim actually
1147465 they do not need to retain a 19 9 stake in the company to have an agreement to use umts on both sides of the tasman
1147466 we apologize for the knee jerk reaction and have issued a retraction order the affected stores are being directed to put the magazines back on sale
1147467 the parody of our newspaper ad in the august mad was very clever most of us at circuit city share a rich sense of humor and irony but there are occasional temporary lapses
1147468 guaranteed in stock if youre friends with an employee who hid it in the back for you otherwise ooh sorry all sold out
1147469 any of our other 600 stores directly across the street from 600 other best buys
1147470 which incidentally was featured in last weeks flyer for four hundred bucks more pity the suckers who bought it then
1147471 as a gesture of our apology and deep respect for the folks at mad magazine we are creating a cross departmental task force to study the importance of humor in the corporate workplace and expect the resulting powerpoint presentation to top out at least 300 pages chock full of charts graphs and company action plans
1147472 we at mad were shocked and confused by this entire incident mainly because we had no idea that circuit city even sells magazines nonetheless we accept their apology but hold out hope that their gesture of a 20 gift card is only an opening offer
1147473 just because you can doesnt mean you should do it
1147474 but i pretty much answer to anything that begins with a and isnt followed by two ss
1147475 let us generously open our hearts and make room for everything that the faith itself allows there is no contradiction between the two editions of the roman missal in the history of the liturgy there is growth and progress but no rupture what earlier generations held as sacred remains sacred and great for us too and it cannot be all of a sudden entirely forbidden or even considered harmful it behooves all of us to preserve the riches which have developed in the churchs faith and prayer and to give them their proper place
1147476 as we stated last week we believe weve made a fair offer and we look forward to a response from imclones board on that offer
1147477 while the news regarding a potential imclone restructuring was unexpected imclones response to the initial bristol myers offer was not
1147478 accordingly the board is reviewing whether bristol myers had access to confidential information concerning imclone and its pipeline
1147479 we are tremendously grateful for the generosity of mr easton and his foundation the grant allows us to launch a new league and that has been a dream of ours for several years with the socal league well be fostering the same values of life long physical fitness community and self confidence combined with athletic competition that has been so successful in northern california
1147480 sports have been very good to me throughout my life and my hope is to help provide sporting opportunities to young people everywhere we feel that a great place to start creating those opportunities is right here in southern california
1147481 we know that good coaching means working closely with families and helping athletes create a balanced life perspective we aim to take the socal high school mountain bike teams in the same direction as we have in northern california working to make cycling as important as baseball football and soccer in the fabric of our high schools
1147482 without a doubt this addiction is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced from the gas prices that are wiping out your paychecks and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state from the instability and terror bred in the middle east to the rising oceans and record drought and spreading famine that could engulf our planet
1147483 plug in hybrids are perhaps not good for all areas s tates that are heavily coal that equation doesnt work out very well for the environment
1147484 oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
1147485 it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option
1147486 i hope if its a boy you name him james walter biffle iii
1147487 in fact i dont think the babys last name is going to be biffle its going to be biffle piepmeier
1147488 its the first ever loss of subscribers by a major satellite tv company

1147490 during a great period of intense mixing we decided that it might be nice to shoot a video this isnt the way the record industry works and so it was under the radar of the label and done totally for us by us on a shoe string it was totally different from any other promo that ive made in that it was something real that we just filmed rather than trying to create something real looking using lots of people and lots of angles i feel like its more than a video in that sense aswell as looking quite odd without all the singing and quick cuts
1147491 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making
1147492 what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years he was in washington for twenty six of them
1147493 and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil he voted against increased fuel efficiency standards and opposed legislation that included tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind power against an energy bill that while far from perfect represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country so when senator mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis its important to remember that hes been a part of that failure
1147494 there i am going pee in wendys by my office when a wendys employee comes into the bathroom and goes into the stall to pee

1147519 im absolutely confident that if this congress were brought back to washington d c and given an opportunity to vote on giving more access to the american people of american oil that there is a bipartisan majority in the congress that would pass that measure

1147523 for six years republicans controlled every branch of government and did nothing while america became more dependent on foreign sources of oil

1147543 russian writer alexander solzhenitsyn who exposed stalins prison system in his novels and spent 20 years in exile has died near moscow at the age of 89
1147544 former nobel prize winner and one of the soviet unions most famous dissident writers has released a biography about his life opposing stalin
1147545 he was the conscience of a nation whose writings exposed the horrors of the communist gulag and galvanised russian opposition to the tyranny of the soviet union
1147546 when 1999 turned into 2000 a lot of people asked
1147547 his masterpiece a work unprecedented anywhere at any time in human history was the gulag archipelago a three volume history of
1147548 alexander solzhenitsyn was an anachronism a real giant in every sense let us small souls be silent in respect for the death of a giant
1147549 solzhenitsyns massive gulag archipelago was published in english in three volumes between 1974 and 1978 it is one the indispensable books of the last fifty years not least because it undermined the moral and political legitimacy of the entire communist enterprise this unique experiment in literary investigation
1147550 to hear and see what it was all like search arrest interrogation prison deportation transit camp prison camp hunger beatings labor corpses
1147551 aleksandr solzhenitsyn is one of the great souls of the age he is also among its most maligned and misunderstood figures it is hard to think of another prominent writer whose thought and character have been subjected to as many willful distortions and vilifications over the past thirty years

1147650 years of appreciating the grateful deads music leaves one with the impression that the bands surviving members all maintain a certain kind of house surely rhythm guitarist bob weir lives in a moss covered mansion where little pixie servants tend to his benevolent whims and drummer bill kreutzmann resides below the oceanic photic zone with kindly umbrella mouth gulper eels or at the very least bassist phil lesh makes his home with dancing bears in a rainbow colored cave but that isnt the case according to city records mr lesh and his wife jillspeth paid 1 775 000 earlier this month for a condo on prince street near broadway where there are russian models and bluetooth bearing bankers and lots of saturday afternoon soho tourists but probably few deadheads
1147651 unlike meditation there is no need to find a quiet place and free time to recite mantras i even chanted mantras throughout the birth of my second child
1147652 when i chanted with my grandmothers beads i felt i was receiving a message from her that i should create a mantra cd
1147653 once i vocalized my desire to make the cd to the universe it all came together
1147654 it only took 9 months from an idea to a complete cd i started working with one of the most famous mantra experts who happened to live in houston named chandrakantha courtney i explained to her that i wanted to introduce some fusion elements and make it accessible to kids i used a royalty free website from norway which has beautiful indian fusion music and had chandrakantha do the background singing for the chants
1147655 being a sanskrit expert she made sure i was true to the legacy of mantras and maintained their integrity i have just put a 21st century twist to them
1147656 there is so much more interest in the western community are we losing our traditions

1147731 if george bush and john mccain want a debate about protecting the united states of america thats a debate im happy to have anytime any place and that is a debate that i will win because george bush and john mccain have a lot to answer for
1147732 i know that even a successful war against iraq will require a us occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and encourage the worst rather than best impulses of the arab world and strengthen the recruitment arm of al qaeda i am not opposed to all wars im opposed to dumb wars
1147733 the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration is ridiculous
1147734 it would be a mistake look if were going to do something about nuclear proliferation just to take one issue that i think is as important as any on the list weve got to have russia involved the amount of loose nuclear material thats floating around in the former soviet union the amount of technical know how that is in countries that used to be behind the iron curtain without russias cooperation our efforts on that front will be greatly weakened china is going to be one of the dominant economies already is and will continue to grow at an extraordinary pace the notion that we dont want to be engaged in a serious way with china or that we would want to exclude them from the process of creating international rules of the road that are able to maintain order in the financial markets that are able to address critical issues like terrorism that are able to focus our attention on disparities of wealth between countries that does not make sense
1147735 theres no doubt in my mind that once these people are gone that we will be welcomed as liberators
1147736 im confident were on the right course its very very difficult but i am confident that an imperfect democracy is what well get out of iraq will be vastly superior to what the people of iraq had prior to this
1147737 theyd have to be specific and they iraqi government officials would have to meet them
1147738 i think everybody knows the consequences havent met the benchmarks obviously then were not able to complete the mission then you have to examine your options
1147739 make it a 100 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea 50 years or so that would be fine with me
1147740 the military says conditions based and maliki said conditions based yesterday in the joint statement with bush
1147741 colonel macfarland was contacted by one of the major sunni sheiks because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others and it began the anbar awakening i mean thats just a matter of history
1147742 first of all a surge is really a counterinsurgency strategy and its made up of a number of components and this counterinsurgency was initiated to some degree by colonel mcfarland in anbar province relatively on his own so im not sure frankly that people really understand that a surge is part of a counterinsurgency strategy
1147743 the first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency the second is war both bring a temporary prosperity both bring a permanent ruin but both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists
1147744 dont fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool
1147745 evolutionary science is as much about the posturing salesmanship stonewalling and bullying as it is about actual scientific theory
1147746 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1147747 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1147748 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1147749 the first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency the second is war both bring a temporary prosperity both bring a permanent ruin but both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists

1147759 i feel like a dinner plate living in a sandbox that sprouts toaster ovens
1147760 yeah they werent throwing the ball to me mom so i decided to do something else
1147761 oggi verr a trovarti sono cos felice ho bisogno di parlare con te
1147762 one day someone will design a pishvee and they will start using it instead of all their plastic and paper bags and then they will award him the nobel prize
1147763 i think that back in the 60s and 70s a lot of the way we regulated industry was top down command and control were going to tell businesses exactly how to do things
1147764 you know what if you simply set some guidelines some rules and incentives for businesses let them figure out how theyre going to for example reduce pollution
1147765 i actually think that we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix there are no silver bullets to this issue we have to develop solar i have proposed drastically increasing fuel efficiency standards on cars an aggressive cap on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted but were going to have to try a series of different approaches
1147766 we cannot drill our way out of the problem instead of subsidizing the oil industry we should end every single tax break the industry currently receives and demand that 1 of the revenues from oil companies with over 1 billion in quarterly profits go toward financing alternative energy research and infrastructure
1147767 when i hear mccain say that he is now in favor of the same oil drilling off the coast that he was opposed to just a week ago what he doesnt tell you is that george bushs own energy department has said that this would have no impact on consumers until 2030
1147768 no appreciable impact for the next 22 years something theyre not telling consumers
1147769 i think its a very important signal to lift the ban on offshore drilling i know that democratic sen barack obama is opposed to lifting the ban on offshore drilling i think the states should continue to decide
1147770 does nothing to reduce fuel consumption nothing to increase our energy independence nothing to improve air quality
1147771 vital alternative energy source not only because of our dependency on foreign oil but its greenhouse reduction effects
1147772 i have to agree with the governor im a federalist the states should decide to enormous degrees what happens within those states including off their coasts the people of california have decided they dont want oil drilling off their coasts the people of louisiana have decided that they do i applaud the governors efforts and that of other states in this region and other states to try to eliminate the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change suppose that the governor and i are wrong and theres no such thing as climate change we adopt these green technologies of which the us and the innovative skills we have and the entrepreneurship and the free market cap and trade proposal is enacted then all weve done is giving our kids a cleaner world
1147773 it seems to me the reason california went the way they did was because we federally failed to act to address greenhouse gas emissions
1147774 so my goal would be to see a federal standard that every state could embrace i think we can achieve a status where that would go away
1147775 we were at the bridge and we came over to the wisconsin side
1147776 we were walking through the woods and this guy jumps out in all camouflage and he had a gun and he started shooting at us and i seen two of our friends fall and me and this other girl started running

1147779 this is in regards to one of my buddies being shot
1147780 ive got someone firing shots gun shots from the east kingsford train bridge they are firing from the wisconsin side of the border
1147781 all i know is that he says hes been shot in the head is still breathing cant talk or anything like that
1147782 do you know what kind of bullets or bbs or
1147783 nope no idea enough that the guy is bleeding from the head he cant respond though

1147795 israel and the idf israeli defense forces both of whom operate according to humanitarian values in order to save lives took action both on sunday and again today when danger to the mens lives became apparent
1147796 it is no honor for hamas to prompt some hellis family members especially the wounded to seek israeli ambulances and the israeli gaza border crossing seeking the help of the israelis
1147797 and it is no honor for the hellis family and its leader ahmad hellis who has a son who was martyred while fighting the israelis to accept this israeli rescue and enemys protection from the brothers no matter how sharp or bloody the disputes

1147804 so if u s congress does not grant a waiver by the end of september it means your astronauts in 2012 will be preparing for their missions on the ground and will not be flying
1147805 the bottom line is that congress is very wary of russia

1147825 eerybody keeps talking about how the packers are so high on rodgers lets not fool ourselves there either because if they were that sure that he was the quarterback of the future theyd have given him a four year extension
1147826 if rodgers stunk it up the first one two games whats going to happen

1147907 given the fluid nature of things in the economy and the financial markets the directive isnt likely to provide any closure for those looking for a telltale hint on when the next policy move will occur it should convey the idea that the fed is still in a wait and see mode
1147908 without an additional government policy jolt the economy is headed for a very slow second half of 2008 either the third or fourth quarters should register negative gdp growth

1147991 the career academies produced an average increase of 311 in real monthly earnings for young men this amounts to a 17 percent increase over and above the average earnings of 1 792 per month of young men in the non academy group

1148032 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
1148033 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
1148034 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do

1148038 considering that any debate will be highly political in nature and any vote may well be whipped by the political parties we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced
1148039 risks conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1148040 this is a recipe for confusion that arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned

1148042 im glad this committee has helped to expose ministers misleading claims
1148043 the foreign office was clearly disturbed that former ambassadors like christopher meyer and craig murray were able to publish highly critical memoirs while paying only lip service to the rules
1148044 but in trying to stop that happening again they have changed the rules in a way that has at least on paper serious unintended consequences this looks like a case of back to the drawing board
1148045 freedom of information means that it is not up to the government to decide what information is made public and what stays private
1148046 yet there seem to be different rules for memoirs if i were a minister or a civil servant writing my memoirs i would think it was reasonable for government to suggest changes i should make for public interest reasons but not for it to censor me
1148047 i so want to change and get out of this life style im in
1148048 i really hope this is not another phase i want to change for good i hate this life style of mine

1148050 here is what i am going to do im changing my number im going to cut off everyone who is not necessary all those people who waste my time who make me sin i want a simple life i do not want to be doing anything which is contradictor to my deen no ibtisam i cant live this life anymore i feel like a hypocrite like im living a double life that is not going to be me anymore i cannot take the guilt i dont want to feel ashamed in front of allah anymore

1148054 she said and run back in i called the lift and stepped inside i bent down to straighten my shoe strap when i stood up again there in the suddenly tiny lift was the bus guy and the door was closing errrg i though
1148055 im not i need fresh air it is too loud and hot
1148056 this is my families wedding unless you want your legs broken

1148094 aggregate of the number of just group shares for which acceptance instructions had been received under the acceptance facility and the number of just group shares in which premier has a relevant interest
1148095 we have confidence because in conversations this morning a couple of institutional owners indicated they are going to accept our enhanced offer and we are very pleased about that
1148096 i dont think i can comment on who we have spoken to
1148097 the chairman said he was confident premier would get to 50 per cent acceptance after major shareholders indicated they would back the deal
1148098 the chairman asserts the bid would have reached the minimum 50 per cent threshold even without the improved terms but the sweetener was enough to persuade a couple of instos who said a few bob more would do the job
1148099 he the chairman said that several institutional shareholders had indicated they would accept the enhanced and final offer
1148100 and substantiation of those statements just group sought interim orders that pending the final determination by the panel premier be restrained from dispatching the supplementary bidders statement to just group shareholders
1148101 had said that just group shareholders sufficient to take acceptances to over 50 had told premier that they would accept the offer
1148102 at this stage premier has not received firm acceptances or firm indications of an intention to accept from holders of over 50 of just shares premier had not received firm acceptances or firm indications of an intention to accept from holders of sufficient shares to require it to update the market by 9 30am today on the level of acceptances as at the close of business yesterday premier had received acceptances from holders of 1 89 of just shares premier also owns 0 9 of just shares premier has always anticipated that acceptances will begin to flow into its institutional acceptance facility during the course of this week
1148103 was misleading as the basis for this belief had not been disclosed
1148104 premier makes this announcement at the request of the takeovers panel following the application by just group limited

1148141 mike smith brings to this position a wealth of knowledge and experience from both within defence and non government organisations mike smiths expertise in civil military cooperation stems from his field experience as deputy force commander in east timor and subsequently as the chief executive officer of austcare
1148142 i have no doubt that mike smith will be a great asset in establishing a centre that will harness government agencies in developing practical contributions to stabilisation reconstruction and peace keeping operations it will also provide an excellent outreach capability to non government and international organisations as well as subject matter experts it will network internationally with similar organisations including regional peacekeeping centres
1148143 the asia pacific centre for civil military cooperation was a key election commitment of the rudd labor government through coordinating a whole of government approach the centre will further strengthen the quality and effectiveness of australias international assistance efforts this in turn strengthens australias contribution to international stability and development i am delighted to have mike smith onboard to lead the centre and know that through his leadership and experience he will play an enormous role in establishing this important capability

1148160 business club australia represents a unique opportunity to profile and present australian business strengths with one voice at one time and in one location while the worlds focus is on the beijing olympics
1148161 its a particularly strong opportunity to showcase australian strengths as a supplier of quality food and beverages including wine in a festive and celebratory atmosphere
1148162 chinas middle class is almost 50 million strong and is predicted to reach 150 million over the next 10 years the increased awareness of international food and beverage choices combined with the rapid pace of urbanisation will mean continued rising demand for imported food and beverage products
1148163 rising awareness of the benefits of healthy natural and organic foods is also seeing a shift in consumer tastes and australias clean and green nation brand profile can help exporters get the attention of customers and distributors
1148164 austrade has identified many opportunities in wine and other australian beverages including juice and water which continues to rise in popularity as western tastes influence local consumer choices
1148165 at the business club australia food and beverage event chinese buyers will be treated to a range of products such as the iconic aussie meat pie australian native bush ingredients from robins foods such as lemon myrtle wattle seed and bush tomato as well as unique straits brand vodka and gin infused with australian flavours such as tasmanian pepper berries and hibiscus flowers

1148167 in my worldwide ibm marketing role i have the benefit of working with some of the finest international interactive agencies and internal web teams as i read the design of sites i see the insight from years of professional advice has been put to paper nowhere have i seen such a practical effective and easy to use book to solve and avoid internet design issues i keep a copy of the book handy to remind me of the things i forgot and to gain fresh perspectives it never fails to deliver
1148168 the design of sites artfully brings forward the original intent of christopher alexanders pattern language into the user experience design arena it is a valuable and comprehensive reference
1148169 the design of sites is one of the best tools i have in my usability toolbox these web ui design patterns make it easy for me to show my clients how to get the most usability bang for their buck
1148170 if only biology class had been like this lucid text bulletproof content and a comprehensive taxonomy thats just as much a source of inspiration as it is a production tool this is a really really good book if you build web sites read it
1148171 stop reinventing the wheel every time you design a web site the design of sites helps you rethink your web sites in terms of genres and patterns once you have identified the patterns and applied the best practices for those patterns as outlined in this book you will reduce your design effort by 50 percent at least
1148172 the content in the design of sites could make a novice into a seasoned professional over a weekend many companies pay a fortune for the information contained in the books primary chapters
1148173 this book has many handy checklists for what you should and should not do in creating a conventional web site just following the authors suggestions would put your site in the top few percent for readability and usability
1148174 now that the design of sites has made its appearance we wont have to put up with those poorly designed web pages these authors have captured patterns from successful web designers including their own experience in consulting and teaching and have made this information accessible to all of us the book is readable yet full of worthwhile information a valuable addition to any web designers bookshelf
1148175 the design of sites bridges the gap from theory to practice and makes it possible for people in the web design space to use user centered design principles in their work without having to undertake extensive training
1148176 the coverage in the design of sites is excellent issues go beyond the traditional design the best page focus and do a good job of showing the context i havent seen any other book with the kind of breadth this has
1148177 with this book as a reference you can benefit from what companies like yahoo have learned and apply it to your site even if you dont have a design and research team similarly sized and staffed

1148184 i know this whole thing is an accident for sure i believe it started from the gas fumes
1148185 i just remember my friend always telling me that joey always cracked his garage at night so the fumes would get out and what i believe happened is that joeys room is right above the garage and amber smokes cigarettes and what we think is a possibility is that maybe she fell asleep and the garage blew up

1148187 the relationship between theology and philosophy so inextricably linked that changes in the one would directly affect the other new philosophy would bring in new divinity
1148188 allinga was convinced that those who did not embrace their religion after a thorough investigation of its fundamental truths would fall into atheism at its first blow that was why the cartesian method was so important it showed the way to certitude
1148189 the cartesian theologians who believe that the truth of gods existence might only be accepted because man sees a reason to do so imply that children and simple folk who are unable to undertake such an investigation are not allowed to embrace the truth and that they may not be told by others what to believe
1148190 belief does not require any proofs from nature belief precedes all investigation
1148191 a suspension of judgement and a close scrutiny of the truth

1148239 but the only way that system can work is when sources know if you lie or mislead the reporter into a false report you will be exposed people who believe strongly in the need for confidential sources should be strongly in favor of their exposure in clear cases of abuse because that is the only way a practice like this has a prayer of retaining its legitimacy

1148242 the pain of having a family member or friend go missing is intense and made even worse by not being able to ask why or even find out if the missing person is safe
1148243 going missing is not a crime and the afp is often called upon to balance the competing priorities of the missing person and their loved ones in intensely emotional family settings
1148244 i applaud the work of the afp in this area and i encourage parents to keep the lines of communication open with their children
1148245 i wish to thank mr vos for his valuable work as inspector general of taxation since the inception of the position in 2003 and i wish him all the best in his future endeavours

1148275 if all incompatible donors and recipients were simply listed in one common pool the problems related to incompatible and poorly matched donors and recipients would be a thing of the past
1148276 newyork presbyterian weill cornell introduced the registry to ucla a few months ago prompting ucla to join the innovative program
1148277 this is a rare instance of a living donor kidney being shipped across the country to initiate a chain
1148278 if we can become comfortable shipping living donor kidneys like we do with deceased donor kidneys then thousands of patients will have the opportunity to receive a kidney who otherwise would have been forced to remain on dialysis
1148279 the hope is that this marks the first of many such collaborations among the nations transplant centers
1148280 donor chains have enormous potential to expand the donor pool and to provide better matched organs for the many individuals who are in desperate need of lifesaving transplants
1148281 kidney donor chains could have a significant impact on the countrys organ donor shortage
1148282 whereas the chain involves an extra donor in the beginning so you can initiate a self propagating cascade
1148283 but in this case ucla received a live donor kidney from new york which hasnt been done before
1148284 living donor exchange represents the pinnacle of teamwork and professional and personal trust and good faith that ideally epitomizes the organ transplant endeavor
1148285 the team consists of surgeons physicians nurses coordinators patients and donors all working together toward the same goal
1148286 patients can wait up to eight years for a deceased donor transplant
1148287 this donor chain may enable hundreds of patients to receive a kidney thanks to one generous altruistic donor rather than in the past where only one patient benefited from an altruistic donor this could significantly decrease the waiting list for kidney transplantation
1148288 i have had the incredibly sad experience of having a colleague die while waiting for a kidney transplant
1148289 i have a close friend who donated a kidney to her brother and i have a close friend who received a kidney more than a decade ago and i see the terrific experiences shes had since
1148290 when i started thinking about it i thought im able and healthy at this point in my life to do this to help someone have more years of a better life why not donate the beauty of this partnership between excellent doctors transplant coordinators and staff at newyork presbyterian weill cornell ucla and a group of seven people a partnership connecting both coasts is that a chain of people have better lives and the chain goes on
1148291 if we can get this exchange program going its going to be the answer to lots of peoples situations
1148292 this is going to help so many people down the line
1148293 pam couldnt sit on the transplant wait list for several years something needed to be done im glad i could do my part to help
1148294 everyone would benefit if more donated today its me tomorrow its someone else
1148295 it was like a closed door that is now being opened again
1148296 randy and i talked about it and we said ok hes willing to give to somebody else and i wont have to take as many medications after the surgery
1148297 could we just teach them our good habits and not our bad
1148298 that just highlights how important it is to intervene early and set healthy lifestyle patterns early on
1148299 when a person uses a disinfectant she should be able to wholeheartedly trust that that disinfectant is doing what the label claims
1148300 lonza misled the public but epa is turning this situation into a positive by overseeing this quality assurance program and sending a message to others that these deceptive actions will not be tolerated
1148301 the fdas regulatory decisions affect the health of millions of americans and we dont make those decisions in a vacuum
1148302 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent todays announcement strengthens our processes
1148303 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1148304 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1148305 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1148306 we have to divorce the private spiritual lives of employees and the situation they are in in the workplace

1148311 the significance of this is for other groups of patients with neurological impairment
1148312 do all of these patients have the same mechanism for reflux and swallowing disorders if not performing a fundoplication anti reflux surgery may not help in fact it may make things worse like it did in the rett girls
1148313 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems
1148314 if we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the problems being experienced by these children we just might be able to find a way to make life a little more comfortable for them
1148315 the most stubborn heresy in the history of monotheism is the belief that god chooses people for exclusive privilege not for missional responsibility
1148316 at times the aircraft may be down as low as several hundred feet
1148317 local residents may notice this uncommon flying pattern but it is certainly nothing to worry about

1148328 it seems that longevity and marriage are directly linked and marriage is good for your health
1148329 whenever i travel around australia i am continually surprised to meet couples who have been married for more than 70 years it is simply marvellous and re assuring
1148330 our ageing population is to be celebrated and is re shaping our society australians now have the second longest life expectancy in the world
1148331 overseas studies have provided similar results on marriage and ageing and the link with longevity has been debated for more than 100 years

1148338 i greatly enjoyed the productive meeting i had with secretary general gurr a at the oecd ministerial council meeting in june i look forward to further discussions with him in melbourne and in particular exchanging views on developments last week in geneva and how the multilateral trading negotiations might be developed from here
1148339 the rudd government is transitioning the area consultative committees such as the viccentral highlands acc into a new network regional development australia or rda which will have a much broader and more strategic role than the previous network
1148340 by building on and replacing the accs rda offers a real opportunity to provide a supporting mechanism for communities with a vision and the determination to make that vision a reality
1148341 i have been pleased with the professionalism and enthusiasm with which accs have approached the three tasks
1148342 we have a unique opportunity to implement a more strategic responsive and flexible approach to regional development and i look forward to working closely with the people of regional australia in implementing this agenda
1148343 we recognise that regional communities like ballarat are concerned about their long term sustainability and todays forum shows that were listening ms king said
1148344 from big businesses to government to ngos the range of nominations that weve received for the australian privacy awards has been unbelievably impressive
1148345 i believe it shows that organisations are increasingly recognising the value that good privacy practices play in building customer relationships
1148346 we invite you to show your support for privacy innovation and achievement by joining us at the gala presentation
1148347 thats kevin he can speak chinese but you cant baba but thats ok i will be your teacher
1148348 the rudd government is serious about attracting and encouraging sustainable development opportunities for australias vast north and this meeting with government and business leaders in western australia was an important part of the process
1148349 gaining an understanding of local views and priorities is critical to northern australias ongoing development and its economic social and environmental prosperity
1148350 the government is committed to working closely with northern jurisdictions including local government as well as business and communities to achieve the best possible outcomes for northern australia
1148351 talking directly to people to the government and business leaders in western australia gives me a greater understanding of the critical issues and challenges they are currently facing
1148352 these meetings will help guide the office of northern australias future priorities and inform future regional policy development
1148353 dominique moreau is the president of hommes en jupe men in skirts an association of about 30 men in poitiers western france who don skirts to go about their everyday lives for them getting dressed in the morning is less about style and more about political substance they are fighting to reclaim an item of clothing last worn by frenchmen more than 500 years ago were fighting against prejudice and cliches

1148355 sellers who paid commission rates 3 percent or lower were just as satisfied with their brokers performance as those who paid 6 percent or more suggesting that haggling cant hurt
1148356 we found that paying an agent a lower commission rarely had any effect on the sales price
1148357 were more likely to say they had regrets about the selling process the biggest regret nearly one third said they should have been more assertive in negotiating their agents fee

1148359 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
1148360 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
1148361 early on it was unique and different but as it became a global chain the standardisation made it lose some of that coolness and edginess it was quickly copied and lost its lustre
1148362 australia was never like that we were curious about it wed read about it it was something to try
1148363 but once tried i dont know that it offered a particularly fantastic or unique experience that wasnt offered by other chains
1148364 firstly its the product and the taste and secondly the place and the service
1148365 its much easier for the local store to differentiate itself as being local whereas starbucks had this slightly schizophrenic positioning where it wanted to be the global local store
1148366 the american seattle based coffee of starbucks was never going to resonate and penetrate australias very big coffee drinking community
1148367 theres no question starbucks in many ways is an admirable company
1148368 starbucks has done very well in international markets where there has not traditionally been a coffee drinking culture
1148369 starbucks is one of the nicest coffees that ive tried
1148370 its a stronger taste which i like its a unique experience and its renowned for being good which is why people love it
1148371 its okay but there are privately owned cafes that id rather go to
1148372 you know its good to have friends you can do nerd things with
1148373 in korean so we werent following the jesus bus to tongdo sa
1148374 between the two of us we know three languages but we still cant talk
1148375 i think andy and the player personnel people have done a great job of retooling the defense with young fast players to go along with the veteran mix that we have
1148376 this isnt about rebuilding retooling or anything this is about going for it thats our approach its pedal to the metal thats what every move is based on what every attempted move is based on with an eye towards the present and an eye towards the future were going for it
1148377 theres a lot of success and a lot of hunger to win a championship i kind of feel this decade that weve accomplished virtually everything we can except win a championship multiple division titles nfc championship a lot of number one seeds but we havent won a super bowl championship and thats what i want for our fans and thats day to day all i think about
1148378 turkey hill we have teamed up for seven years now for every interception i get they donate 1 000 to the juvenile diabetes foundation as well as for every touchdown sundae that is sold they donate 5 cents i think it is to eagles youth partnership hopefully ill get a whole bunch of interceptions this year for every touchdown i get so lets pray for some touchdowns for me 10 000 goes to juvenile diabetes its a great cause i believe thats why im a part of it i want to thank turkey hill for all they have been doing for me
1148379 we are very excited that we have reached an agreement with lou williams
1148380 he is not only a very talented player who exemplifies our up tempo style of play but he is also a young man who exhibits great character and qualities off the court as well we look forward to having him in a sixers uniform for many years to come
1148381 were happy that lou is back as he has proven to be an integral part of the team
1148382 hes made great strides as a player and were very confident hell continue to excel with us for years to come
1148383 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1148384 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1148385 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1148386 the rebates are not translating into anywhere near the spending impulse that congress and the administration had hoped for
1148387 under these circumstances the economy remains in very fragile condition indeed
1148388 on balance this was a negative report showing a slowdown in spending and acceleration in inflation
1148389 we expect consumption will continue to weaken especially as the rebate effect fades
1148390 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
1148391 its a shame because for a lot of students we have nowhere else to really work out
1148392 when i heard fridays i said this is a bummer
1148393 i am not unsympathetic to the concerns but given the mandated cuts i dont have the money at this point
1148394 its very important to keep these centers open regularly because tennis is very expensive to play
1148395 the city provides a service to folks who cant afford it
1148396 while our leasing activity and rental rate growth remain steady and in line with expectations our caution for the remainder of 2008 has increased
1148397 weve taken additional steps to further strengthen our balance sheet this year
1148398 amicable and that they would spend the rest of their lives together as best friends
1148399 a very cute little girl grabbed my leg and asked where are my parents where are my brothers
1148400 i saw her parents and brothers were on a plane that was set to take off in three minutes
1148401 i ran quickly because i knew that every minute mattered at the same time the police tried to contact the flight attendants to get them to stop the plane when i reached the gate the plane was no longer there
1148402 were in shock theyre very responsible and organised top notch people apparently one relied on the other and this is what happened
1148403 what if everything is an illusion and nothing exists i definitely overpaid for my carpet if only god would give me a clear sign like making a large deposit in my name in a swiss bank
1148404 god wants you to be rich the theology of economics
1148405 in every possible way health love and peace of mind as well as material possessions god wants this however not just for our own sake but for the sake of all humankind an increase in the wealth for an individual almost always represents an even larger increase in wealth for society at large
1148406 how do i screen out satans calls will caller id work is a telephone the only way god has of calling me what if god calls collect
1148407 how to get rich one of the worlds greatest entrepreneurs shares his secrets
1148408 the problem with having a job is that it gets in the way of getting rich
1148409 i dont think the government loves these people the secret is to put money somewhere that it will grow without your having to pay taxes on it immediately
1148410 fell for many reasons but three reasons are worth remembering declining moral values and political civility at home an overconfident and overextended military in foreign lands and fiscal irresponsibility by the central government
1148411 each soul comes to the earth with gifts to contribute its specialness in specific ways each soul agrees to perform certain tasks upon earth it enters into a sacred agreement with the universe all of the experiences of your life serve to awaken within you the memory of that contract and to prepare you to fulfill it
1148412 i never just sit and do nothing rather i do whatever is in front of me and leave the results up to him however it turns out thats gods will for me
1148413 pretty much all the credit cards use average daily balance
1148414 so it can range from six days interest to we wont let you out period
1148415 they definitely are the gotchas in there if you do things wrong
1148416 are done a little bit differently depending upon what credit card you choose
1148417 couple days after the closing period but nothing too late
1148418 7 queda claro en cualquier caso que el v nculo sacramental de pertenencia al cuerpo de cristo que es la iglesia dado por el car cter bautismal es una uni n ontol gica permanente y no se pierde con motivo de ning n acto o hecho de defecci n
1148419 you are a hylian and you were bound to leave this forest and now you have learned your own destiny so you know what you must do thats right you must save the land of hyrule
1148420 saria the forest sage shes alive too the kokori are real
1148421 you have to come to this forest they need you
1148422 come on link ive got to get you out of here
1148423 take it easy with that arm it will take a while for the bones to heal
1148424 alright return to your duties shell be alright lets go
1148425 we are trying our best to keep everyone safe we dont want anyone setting a poor example for the younger ones
1148426 we are running out of healing supplies we can only heal so many injuries we cant waste our materials
1148427 epona is a dangerous creature we wouldve hoped you had learned that from arylls experience
1148428 dont provoke the younger ones to go and try to be heroes the fact is they are too young theyll get hurt dont you understand what im trying to tell you
1148429 how do you know its true what proof do you have
1148430 we can at least try its better than barring ourselves in this god forsaken place
1148431 so youre going to just ride out into that forest are you
1148432 only rusl is sending out messages only rusl dared go out there and get those potions why dont you let him go hell get the job done and ill go with him i did save him last time
1148433 i tried getting through to epona because she is the only one who knows where link is horses have very high intelligence and from my understanding epona is especially smart if my dream is wrong or right epona would know she is the only key to finding link
1148434 if you all started doing something then maybe i wouldnt have to
1148435 we have been executing far more sophisticated plans than yours young lady
1148436 well if i was allowed to join your cause and help you out on your sophisticated plans maybe id be of a greater help
1148437 i will help you guys whether you like it or not
1148438 you are as long as youre under my roof in my town
1148439 youre riling her up too much we must discuss this later
1148440 they didnt give you too much of a hard time oh my youre terribly flushed
1148441 you fractured it nearly in four places im so glad rusl and well you found several bottles of red potion otherwise this wouldve taken months to heal maybe even a year
1148442 tree days at the most but by the looks of things you might be healed by tomorrow
1148443 how did you know link made a theme song for her
1148444 have you ever played it for epona i mean while she was in the enclosure
1148445 um yes i used to until i was banded to go near her
1148446 yes it did but only for a short period of time
1148447 oh well it was a while ago but when i played the song
1148448 shed come to me almost like she used to and if i kept playing she would sort of calm down but she would start getting restless as if she was looking for someone
1148449 id always stop because i knew she wouldnt find him
1148450 its our only option its best we do it now
1148451 we have to do this otherwise eventually she may start killing people as well as goats
1148452 but but but suppose dorothys right what if she can show us where link is
1148453 we cant even go near the horse let alone ride her
1148454 if we set her free maybe she could lead us
1148455 its too much of a risk surely you havent forgotten what happened the first day she came
1148456 to do what kill another batch of our live stalk orca snapped
1148457 mayor if you dont mind me saying perhaps lets give epona at least one more day
1148458 for old times sake can we at least give her one last day to breathe the air nothing will happen
1148459 ive got to get you out of here now theyre going to kill you
1148460 ok hang on im going to open this for you ok
1148461 just wait here i should probably go get some real brushes
1148462 how did you why are you here is your arm ok
1148463 its alright i didnt do it in one try you know
1148464 you are exactly like him but i dont know why
1148465 please dont cry everythings going to be ok youll see
1148466 no matter what happens i swear that i will find your brother
1148467 i know uncle rusl too well he worries too much
1148468 he wouldnt want his sword just lying around uselessly in the hands of a little girl it should be put to action its yours now
1148469 you got a spell or something cursed anything you were turned into a girl or or something
1148470 lost your memory only link couldve done that cant you remember me
1148471 no im not link im not related and have never met him this has nothing to do with him
1148472 i i just wanted him back so much i hoped that your similarity meant something that youre connected or something i just wanted him back i want him back
1148473 you are the most hope this town has ever had since the sea vanished you cant understand how much we all treasure you count on you
1148474 you mean all this time you all were counting on me
1148475 we could all sense something about you and it has only gotten stronger just like link
1148476 you dont know how much this means to me how grateful i am
1148477 of course you never change you only let link do it dont you
1148478 when she gave it to me i promised her one thing
1148479 that i wont return without link that ill find her brother and bring him home
1148480 but how epona wont even let a saddle be put on her let alone reins where will you go what will you eat what if what happened to him happens to you too
1148481 but i feel useless here im not the village wrangler im not the wise teacher of combat or history i dont work in the stables im virtually useless here
1148482 im not but thats why i need to go link needs help
1148483 you know no matter how much i want to deny it deep down inside i knew all along you would eventually leave
1148484 but no matter what happens on your journey dont try to do anything out of your league please just come home safely
1148485 i can at least start you off you havent even had breakfast
1148486 im not going back to the village you know how bo will give me hell if he finds out what im planning
1148487 use it when you need it and when you find him please return it to him
1148488 can you tell him that i havent lived a day without thinking about him that ill wait for him for all eternity that i love him with all my heart and i only want him to come home safely
1148489 you are a hylian and you were bound to leave this forest and now you have learned your own destiny so you know what you must do thats right you must save the land of hyrule
1148490 weblogic 10 3 is the foundation from which a lot of this rationalization and integration of products will be built from
1148491 you may hear from people who dont know the details of this that oracle will force you migrate
1148492 is becoming organized and is expected to be very near hurricane strength by the time it reaches the coastline during the day tomorrow
1148493 very near the upper texas coast or the coast of southwestern louisiana by tuesday morning
1148494 edouard could be nearing hurricane strength before reaching the coastline
1148495 maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible over southeastern texas
1148496 chinas role as our olympic host has opened a window to the worlds most populous nation
1148497 i have been in the premier league a long time and have been with bolton a long time and i can tell you now this team will do something next season
1148498 we have a better team than the team i have left bolton
1148499 we have a lot of talent yes but we need to be more focused and we need to have more desire on the pitch too
1148500 tottenham offered us 15 8m for andrei but that does not work for us we are waiting for a new proposal
1148501 logic dictates that if we do find a new home everton would as a club which has finished inside the top six on three occasions in recent years be a more attractive proposition to investors
1148502 bill kenwright has never attempted to hide the fact that he personally does not have the funds to move his club forward to where he and the supporters want it to be and to where they believe it should be at the forefront of the english game self evidently any club which can boast a stadium which is modern fit for purpose and capable of expansion does represent a more attractive proposition to potential investors
1148503 its been a good tour but the one disappointment is that i dont have some more people here with me
1148504 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now to give the players a lift its not just a new face we need its new faces my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season im not going to say i am totally confident because you never know what happens but i am hoping we will get a few in
1148505 ive been impressed with him i like him very much and im pleased weve got him here
1148506 hes a good kid and has the potential to become a very good player he was recommended to me and we got him here straight away because there is a big gulf at the club between senior players and young kids weve got nothing in between really but he can bridge that gap
1148507 last night everything came together and i am now moving to real madrid
1148508 i have always wanted to move to spain and now im going to play for real madrid its a dream come true
1148509 he needs to move on hes got a fresh start with us and thats what he should talk about
1148510 a truly vomitous spectacle shameless clueless and transparent now dont get me wrong i understand why he did it i just really wish he hadnt
1148511 barry has gone from hero to zero we thought he was special a fans footballer a one club man we were wrong
1148512 hell have a hard task to follow thats for sure the first thing that he will have to do is earn the respect of the players we know he is a very good player his batting prowess has already brought him respect hes just got to get that as captain now
1148513 kevin will be fine he is confident single minded and will have a definite approach to how he is going to do it the team have got to perform as well and there is no reason why we cant all be successful together
1148514 its a brave selection in the past they have gone for the tried and tested pietersen might take us somewhere weve never been before lets see where it takes us itll be a good ride hes a strutting character with a real ego and we dont usually go for that kind of guy
1148515 its a good decision i think its a good idea unifying two formats of the game under one leader the continuity will be there hes englands most dominant player and he is one the players will respect its quite an exciting time for england
1148516 it is necessary we have an exact and precise ruling
1148517 it is not only a question of solidarity it is also a question of respect to the olympic spirit to let young players have the experience
1148518 the crux of our meeting was to determine and decipher where peter and i can take this england team
1148519 mooresy likes to challenge us on a daily basis there are a lot of strong opinionated characters in the dressing room and i sat down with peter and we had a real good discussion on how we want to take the team forward
1148520 by moving from player to captain my position has completely changed and we need to unite we need to get on the same hymn sheet and we need to go and get this team moving forward
1148521 it is a brand new test a new challenge and i love challenges i love to test myself out i am fresh into this captaincy thing and i will need advice i spoke to michael vaughan at great length on sunday one of the most exciting things is that i have had text messages and phone calls from the senior members of the squad who have basically told me that they are right behind me and ready to support me they told me to give it my best shot once you have got the support of the lads around you who you are with all the time there is nothing more you can ask for
1148522 time will tell whether the captaincy affects my game i hope it doesnt i hope it wont restrict the way i play i think it would be silly of me to start thinking that it will affect the way i play because i play the way i play and it has brought me success so far in my career
1148523 this is a wonderful opportunity to grab with both hands and run with
1148524 this is all very exciting for me it is a great honour a great privilege to captain england and it is something that has turned my life around again in the last 24 hours my wife was the first person i spoke to after being offered the job i then phoned my mum and dad in south africa and spoke to them at great length because it is a huge job michael vaughan gave a very emotional speech when he resigned and spoke about his family so it was right to speak to my wife and family before i accepted the job
1148525 their places in the team are guaranteed only by their hard work their willingness to do again what they did so magnificently when it mattered this last summer
1148526 what is most exciting of all to me is the future the possibilities have to be so good when this young team have beaten the no 1 team in the world in the most incredible circumstances the pressures and the challenges went beyond what we expected with the levels of expectation going into the last game at the oval when we were asked to bat out the last day and did it so convincingly that told me i had so much character at my disposal but then i also know you are only as good as your back up it means that you have to keep building and its so important we keep getting young players pushing the team and making sure everybody stays honest that is what it is going to take to stay in the team
1148527 big brown stuck out his neck and went and got them
1148528 he showed his true class he made a lead change and showed another gear hes back
1148529 there is the distaff over nine furlongs now called the ladies classic the filly amp mare turf or the mile
1148530 well see but she will stick to a mile in europe she will go to the prix du moulin next on 7 september and wont run in the prix jacques le marois
1148531 i left the choice for the owners but of course i am happy she will not clash with tamayuz the wertheimers the owners had the choice but said they wanted to go to america goldikova is very fast and i wouldnt be afraid of running her over six furlongs
1148532 he is very well as well as before the july cup
1148533 the coach has kept me informed and i support him in what he has done the three of us need to sit down now and work out the best way ahead
1148534 i only said i have a contract until the end of next year and then somebody made up that i will stop at the end of this year or the end of next year im still enjoying formula one but there are a lot of other things in life
1148535 i have a contract with renault for the long term but of course at the end of every season you need to look at what the possibilities are it is not the time now in the middle of august to think but for sure in september and october i will have a think and we will decide
1148536 but of course its not nice when its not going so well
1148537 im racing unless my leg breaks down and i cant run
1148538 thats it the whole thing has been a race against time and a nightmare from when it was diagnosed and everythings had to change and adapt to that im getting more confident day by day because every day that you run on it it gets stronger
1148539 every day i go out and plan to start the race but im running on a leg that could break down its just the fact that because ive not been running huge amounts at full body weight outside on it they team gb dont know whether it will get me there the only decision that would be made would be made for me and i dont want to think about that
1148540 i feel happier even to be at this stage and boosted by that i know from the stuff that ive done that im in good enough shape to be here and to be on the start line i dont know but im guessing im probably not in two hours 12 minutes shape i just think if you put yourself on the start line youre in there with a chance
1148541 this time i think ive had the worst period of stress and now its just get on and enjoy it
1148542 im actually thinking its going to be more like the 2002 london marathon when i had the nightmare with my knee three weeks before and didnt even know if id be ready to start that race when i got to london i was just really happy to be there and ran really well so im hoping this is going to work that way
1148543 i do feel bad for the position that shes been put in but at the same time its something thats important to me the whole way through ive believed i would be here so im not going to give up my place
1148544 things like seven do happen and to come back from that was great because its never easy playing this golf course you have to hit it in the fairways which i did mostly and gave myself good birdie chances my distance control and irons were good and i thought i handled the pressure pretty good
1148545 id rather be in this position than going to beijing early after losing in the first round of course ideally id like to have more time to relax and get used to the venue and the whole olympic atmosphere but ill just have to deal with it
1148546 ive been playing a lot of matches but right now i feel fine both physically and mentally
1148547 the humidity this week was unbelievable it was well over 100 degrees out on court yesterday
1148548 ive played well in these conditions this week but theyre not conditions that you would want to play in all the time its tough after matches to make sure youre properly hydrated and eating the right sort of food you can lose quite a lot of weight playing in those conditions
1148549 the humidity gets to your breathing a little bit and gets you out of breath a lot obviously you sweat more which makes you feel more tired
1148550 it comes from training and the gym work that you do off the court because that eliminates all your possible excuses
1148551 you go on the court in great shape doing the right things because youve been doing the right things off the court you get on the court thinking about tennis not worrying whether youve practised enough or done enough work in the gym i feel much better physically
1148552 once youve beaten someone for the first time you have the feeling you can do it again
1148553 it also gets into the head of the other player when theyve beaten you a few times and then youve broken that run
1148554 that of course took many many hours some people turned back because they did not trust the rope any more
1148555 its enormous very high incredibly steep and much further north than everest which means it attracts notoriously bad weather
1148556 no matter which route you take its a technically difficult climb much harder than everest the weather can change incredibly quickly and in recent years the storms have become more violent people who have recently been there have told me that the snow conditions are also getting worse
1148557 its a very long summit day the climb is technically demanding and even once you get past the bottleneck theres still a long way to go to the top you only have to look at the list of those who have died on k2 to see that it contains some very accomplished climbers
1148558 by accident one of the freest places in the whole of the soviet union
1148559 social kissing has been common in certain circles in britain since the 1920s but until fairly recently it was mostly confined to relatives or close friends and to what you might call the excitable professions the theatre the media fashion anywhere you might call someone darling basically its now infinitely more widespread even accountants do it
1148560 were now starting to see the advent of non sexual lip kissing
1148561 bank manager and customer boss and employee next door neighbours client and accountant any old colleague theyre all greeting each other with a little scuffle round the cheek and lip area the rule seems to be if youve met them even once you kiss them and in business circles certainly that very definitely wasnt the case even three years ago
1148562 we kiss people we used to hug hug people we used to shake hands with and shake hands with people we used to nod to
1148563 its like these days its not unusual to hear teenagers say to their parents i love you in my day if youd said that to your mum or dad theyd have assumed they were about to be given the last rites and were becoming much more tactile theres a whole revolution in that
1148564 its about fast track bonding and empathy it also allows you to smell the other person your nose is right by the pulse behind their ear you can sniff their perfume and have a fairly good guess at what they had for lunch its a far more intimate personal instant connection
1148565 when parents kiss their children it means one thing but when they kiss each other it means something entirely different people will greet a total stranger with a kiss on the cheek and then use an identical gesture to express their most intimate feelings to a lover
1148566 kisses can be given in private or in public by men to men men to women women to women adults to children or children to each other
1148567 they can be unilateral or reciprocated they can be on the lips the cheek or any other part of the body they can be blown in the air
1148568 giving a mutual kiss when they depart from each other a custom that i never saw before nor heard of nor read in any history
1148569 i grew up at a time when if even your mother kissed you you were expected to wipe your mouth on your sleeve for decades a good firm handshake was all that was expected now all of a sudden youre expected to embrace your female colleagues daily even perhaps hug the divisional director from manchester its all become incredibly awkward and embarrassing
1148570 i feel permanently uncomfortable these days most of my friends expect a kiss which is fine i suppose quite nice in fact but at what point do you decide whether a colleague or a regular business contact or client or even a friends partner is also a friend theres a real risk of getting it wrong of offending someone whatever you decide to do i get quite nervous
1148571 the british werent even very good at the handshake and now we find ourselves having to deal with air kisses cheek kisses hugs squeezes even lip kisses its not easy the basic rule i think should be that handshakes are fine with anyone and kisses should be reserved for people you have some kind of relationship with even if its only a business lunch at which youve talked about something other than just business
1148572 really go for broke and you have to give advance warning of your intentions make what we call announcement gestures start puckering early on and raise your hands from quite a distance never kiss anyone without a torso touch by the way then theres a good chance theyll be prepared for whats coming then its basically right cheek to right cheek left cheek to left cheek and put them down where you found them
1148573 its only really man to man where theres still some reticence
1148574 many men particularly younger generations will embrace quite comfortably these days but they still kind of feel the need to accompany it with some big soprano style slap on the back to show that even though they kiss theyre still men
1148575 if you kiss at one meeting and not at the next theyre going to get entirely the wrong message
1148576 take it on the chin when you get it wrong because believe me you will
1148577 the heart attacks you see on tv and in the movies arent what many of us actually experience
1148578 because it is not what they think a heart attack is like people decide to sleep on it or wait a bit
1148579 viv is proving to resemble ange in spirit attitude and physicality and knox hes a bit of me
1148580 tell you what maybe yours can mine cant mine is like a tiny hedgehog i found under a bush
1148581 the first thing we thought was were going to die because 10 years ago to talk about hiv it was to talk about death
1148582 we had a very hard time because it was almost in the same week when they found out i was positive they told me my wife had to be tested
1148583 we dont have much information around we dont and also the culture we have we feel like we are macho and that happens to only those who are on drugs
1148584 weve seen our numbers go up right now 25 percent of our clients of the more than 700 we see in a year 25 percent are hispanic its families men women even children
1148585 i think latinos need to remove the culture and take this disease like any other
1148586 ok has had one or two big issues in recent times including the rooney wedding so they had to compete what they are hoping is that they put on circulation and then they keep some of it hello really do need to be seen to be bringing in the really big ones from time to time
1148587 exclusive brad and angelina share their beautiful family with us
1148588 they are the two biggest stars as a couple in the world
1148589 last time they did this it was proven to be successful since then we have become even more celebrity obsessed unfortunately
1148590 our route for today is to start at the widest part of the lake and swim to a nearby island before getting out and having a little hike then swimming back to the start
1148591 with swimhiking you are freed from the constraints of hiking on foot rivers and lakes become a barrier but if you swimhike you can go much further or at least in more directions
1148592 ive only made a few prototypes but it means im not tied to the spot where i would have left my clothes dogs would do their business on my clothes and kids would steal them though the worst was when a public spirited citizen saw my bundle of clothes and told the police i had committed suicide
1148593 you build up a sweat on land then cool off in the water but i also think its fun in the rain when youre walking and the raindrops hit your clothes its frustrating but if youre in the lake theres water all around anyway so it feels natural
1148594 is that you are mixing land and water so you feel a bit like james bond and tarzan
1148595 it makes people really happy theres something about bobbing around free from gravity in wide open spaces it doesnt cost a thing and it gives you the chance to see the country in a fresh new way
1148596 most people find that they can only stay in a pool for 20 minutes before getting bored but up to an hour or more if they are swimming outdoors if you then combine that with hiking youre getting a real cardiovascular workout
1148597 fabulously funny if only id found it before writer creator chris lilley is a genius i pray for repeats
1148598 its much easier to learn how to contract undamaged muscles
1148599 schoolgirls should learn how to do pelvic floor exercises and do them on a daily basis
1148600 there is much more impact on womens pelvic floors than there used to be and women are more conscious of problems
1148601 about 50 of women will have some urinary leakage at some time after childbirth
1148602 seventy per cent of young girls who trampoline wet themselves
1148603 the pelvic floor is the main focus in pilates nearly every single exercise youre doing even if its one working your feet is engaging the pelvic floor to put it bluntly its just like trying to stop yourself from peeing you engage that part of your body as tightly as possible upwardly and inwardly the most important thing is not to hold your breath at the same time
1148604 there are many issues with incontinence as people get older both for men and women
1148605 c sections partially protect but not completely just being pregnant and having nine months of intra abdominal pressure is enough women who have not had children are less likely to have pelvic floor problems
1148606 if you are born with weak collagen the elastic tissue in your body you are more likely to be exposed to pelvic floor problems
1148607 there is a fine line between worrying women and looking at what they can actually do
1148608 there are so many health messages and there is enough that we would like people to be doing without worrying about their pelvic floor
1148609 because womens expectations of sexual intercourse have altered but if you talk to women in the older generation their expectation is that these things are normal and its just a natural part of getting older previously if someone had incontinence they would just buy pads and limit their activity
1148610 a social predisposition to treat men as unworthy parents betrayers and incorrigible philanderers
1148611 the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at young males

1148616 its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise
1148617 come out to the bainlieue and meet my nike wearing friends
1148618 do you think we could string out some suspense by wondering if shes killed herself
1148619 ive already killed any tension by revealing shes alive at the beginning of the book im going to spend some more temps with my gay mans fantasy decadent and unravelled
1148620 shes alive after all she was just escaping from horrid old you and christian

1148627 the builders of ecohouses accept as a given the basic shape and dropsical proportions of the two storey suburban villa with pitched roofs end gables front porch picture windows chimneys and so forth
1148628 there is usually nothing about the ecohouse to signal that it is a new kind of energy efficient machine for living in
1148629 the slate in the roof may be recycled but with so many solar panels skylights sun tunnels and windows in it and on it theres no good reason for it being made of slate at all
1148630 with mr rodgers again providing the copia and mr hammerstein providing the corn

1148633 appears to be no good evidence that broken windows policing reduces crime nor evidence that changing the desired intermediate output of broken windows policing disorder itself is sufficient to affect changes in criminal behaviour
1148634 im delighted that for the first time a cabinet will be meeting outside of london

1148638 far from being a system of check and balances this is a recipe for confusion that places on parliament tasks that it cannot effectively fulfil and arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned

1148643 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think their child is a healthy weight
1148644 this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1148645 we have to get the balance right between being a nanny state and a neglectful state
1148646 use of the word obese shuts people down they associate it with 10 tonne mums and half tonne kids we have not banned it but we have chosen not to use it theres no point giving them a letter that does not have any impact on their behaviour
1148647 i find this particular line from the government to be tiptoeing through the daffodils
1148648 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice its a nasty word but by god it should sound alarm bells in parents minds
1148649 i find this whole approach from the department of health a bit prissy and namby pamby
1148650 school nurses can make a real difference in helping children develop healthy habits but the government has failed to address the chronic shortage of school nurses
1148651 if ministers are serious about their plans to tackle child obesity then they should use this opportunity to really highlight the health risks it causes
1148652 unless these letters are accompanied by practical help then they will be a waste of time and resources

1148657 would among other things prevent any live tv or radio commentary from former diplomats for the rest of their lives they would thus substantially diminish informed discussion of major world events
1148658 the suggestion that diplomats should not say or write or in any way express views which may draw on their whole professional experience is very far reaching i think it may also be unenforceable
1148659 freedom of information means it is not up to the government to decide what information is made public and what stays private yet there seem to be different rules for memoirs if i were a minister or a civil servant writing my memoirs i would think it was reasonable for government to suggest changes i should make for public interest reasons but not for it to censor me
1148660 we are in a short supply situation right now when supply is down prices go up its as simple as that

1148667 thomas jefferson borrowed from the millennial language of the christian faith to describe his dream for a new temporal paradise spanning a continent comprised of the chosen people of god but in jeffersons civil faith the chosen people were simply any individuals who had the good fortune to be born on american soil

1148691 a huge tunnel had been dug that people were able to walk through but it became unsteady and unfortunately collapsed around the young boy he was trapped in the sand for approximately 20 minutes
1148692 its just a tragic accident that could have been prevented but unfortunately children dont see danger people think that the sea is the danger when they are at the beach but sand can be a killer too wet sand after rain makes it easier for tunnelling but sand is very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
1148693 we were on the beach when everyone suddenly started running towards the dunes the boys father was there trying to dig him out along with lots of other people i couldnt watch but i heard later he had died kids play in the dunes but no one realised the dangers of how a bit of adventure can lead to someone losing their life
1148694 there were about 14 teenagers and the boys mum and dad and auntie and uncle at the scene when we arrived there must have been about two tonnes of sand on top of him
1148695 this remains a met police investigation officers from the homicide command from the specialist crime directorate led by commander simon foy will today begin the process of further assessment and scrutiny to establish whether there are further potential investigative leads in this case
1148696 this investigation has been subject to numerous reviews and assessments since 1999 by the mets internal review group the crown prosecution service criminal case review commission two senior independent treasury counsel and the court of appeal
1148697 to be quite honest and practical i dont think theyll ever find who done it
1148698 ok has had one or two big issues in recent times including the rooney wedding so they had to compete what they are hoping is that they put on circulation and then they keep some of it hello really do need to be seen to be bringing in the really big ones from time to time

1148702 my male friends think my job is awesome but my female friends are less sure
1148703 last year i was barely paid the minimum wage and ended up washing dishes most of the time but this summer i was finding it even harder to get work i looked for months before anything at all came up then i saw an advert on the internet for butlers2go working as a naked butler
1148704 but many of my friends havent managed to get a job at all and those that have are lumped with monotonous jobs with poor pay as a butler i do hen nights baby showers weddings there are some funny incidents the odd woman tries to pull up your apron or kids try to look up it but in general its a great job you have to be very extrovert and confident but its more interesting than some conventional jobs and my wages can be more than 50 a night so i use them towards the cost of living student loans dont go as far as the government seems to think
1148705 ive worked during every uni holiday so far in the cafe of a local hospital two years ago doing admin stuff for a trucking company last summer it was easy i registered with a temping agency and two days later i had a job
1148706 loads of my friends have been moaning about their lack of employment before employers would draft people in to cover holidays but now people seem unwilling to take temps on unless its absolutely necessary ive finally got work now doing data input at the co operative groups headquarters in manchester but its been really frustrating up till this holiday id done my best to avoid going into my overdraft but this summer i had to dip into it when i came home in june and by the time i found my job i was halfway through my funds
1148707 in the past ive found work easily doing admin bookkeeping and working as a receptionist i thought the same would happen this year but its been the opposite i came away from interviews with temping agencies who thought my cv was very positive but they still couldnt find me a job they said that theres minimal temping work available at the moment it can start to affect your confidence you begin to question your abilities and its also made my summer rather tight
1148708 its true that major banking legal and engineering firms keen to prime students for graduate positions increasingly run summer internships and work placements
1148709 but that doesnt mean employers will ignore a more wacky summer job it can show evidence of learning new skills and proving successful in the workplace some firms may also see a varied cv as signs of a potentially innovative and free thinking employee
1148710 my routine was really busy on the day of an event id get my hair and make up done then sort out all the other girls with their costumes hot pants bras pink feathered tops and neon stockings wed head to a beach parade to dance in the afternoon at midnight there was the main town parade to do then do freestyle podium dancing in the club doing sets until six in the morning then id have to make sure all the girls got home before hand washing all the costumes
1148711 in the end i ended up getting ripped off midway through the summer my pay was halved without warning i had to leave ibiza early it wasnt realistic so i had to come home but now im back in london im finding it hard to find another job
1148712 come out to the bainlieue and meet my nike wearing friends
1148713 do you think we could string out some suspense by wondering if shes killed herself
1148714 ive already killed any tension by revealing shes alive at the beginning of the book im going to spend some more temps with my gay mans fantasy decadent and unravelled
1148715 shes alive after all she was just escaping from horrid old you and christian
1148716 yes it happened just like that no dribs or drabs chess is a jealous lover will tolerate no other
1148717 stop the print run and deem the book out of print
1148718 five years ago in response to his appeal patriarch alexy ii gave his blessing to the allotment of a plot in the donskoy monastery graveyard as solzhenitsyns burial place
1148719 he wanted to die in the summer and he died in the summer
1148720 he wanted to die at home and he died at home aleksandr isayevich lived a difficult but happy life
1148721 the death of this great man and one of the major thinkers writers and humanists of the 20th century is an irreparable loss for russia and for the world as a whole
1148722 man of unique destiny whose name will remain in russias history
1148723 oh i didnt know he had died thats sad news
1148724 he was a great man i will probably go and see him tomorrow
1148725 were about to open a new informatics building important in the area of artificial intelligence with a major contribution from government that allowed us to ask others in the private sector to match fund that support
1148726 theres a community of funders who have an interest in sustaining higher education including government large foundations corporations and individuals our job is to make the case about why that public private partnership is so powerful
1148727 its also important for us to demonstrate that tangible benefit in buildings through scholarships that bring the brightest students in the uk here regardless of circumstance and endowing professorships to bring the leading scholars from around the world here
1148728 we have 100 000 graduates i dont know how many oxbridge have but its a lot more than that
1148729 theyve been doing it for more years and have more experience but our case for support is no less in a climate of limited state funding and increasing global competition fundraising is more and more vital
1148730 we are seen to be one of the most financially secure universities in the country but we inherited some pretty inadequate buildings which we are trying to replace resources for teaching and staff lose out
1148731 well recover it from selling existing properties but 100m will have to come from borrowing or gifts
1148732 i had hoped it would be something people would want to rally around the biggest new art college in europe in recent years but so far we havent had great success its very early days but im hoping that will unlock peoples enthusiasm for what were doing here
1148733 universities have to fess up to the fact that they could be a lot more professional about raising money there is philanthropic giving in the uk and in the arts but it doesnt seem to recognise the importance of an institution like this
1148734 we are competing against china and the us we dont have the resources to continue to be the best art and design learning centre in the world in the future
1148735 more people have to invest in our institutions they cant just expect government to do it
1148736 etss problem masks a more endemic massive failure of sats that runs right through the system this is vanity testing so government can feel good about whats happening in primaries and show results are improving but its expensive for primaries not trusted by secondaries and damaging for children
1148737 there is an issue wider than the problems with ets school test results are not a reliable indicator of pupil performance
1148738 we are considering a boycott but some naht members think that wouldnt be a professional response despite the strength of feeling against sats
1148739 i have sympathy with that view but if you got to the point where there is a head of steam throughout the education community against sats and the response from the government is that there will be absolutely no negotiations then eventually you come to a situation where only a very strong campaign will have an effect
1148740 tests have changed several times over the period theyve been around trying to assess standards across the system over time using these tests is of relatively little value if you want to know how a system is performing you only need to test a sample not every 11 and 14 year old in the country
1148741 it is a tragedy that hundreds of thousands will join the millions who have left primary school unable to master the basics in the 3rs basics that are the keystone of future opportunity and success
1148742 standards in our schools are rising and we do not accept that this is the result of teaching to the test
1148743 we are already trialling changes to testing which allow teachers to choose when their pupils take new single level tests
1148744 how is a pupil performing in his or her schooling
1148745 to seek clearance for anything they say that draws on the experience they had in their entire careers
1148746 would among other things prevent any live tv or radio commentary from former diplomats for the rest of their lives they would thus substantially diminish informed discussion of major world events
1148747 the suggestion that diplomats should not say or write or in any way express views which may draw on their whole professional experience is very far reaching i think it may also be unenforceable
1148748 freedom of information means it is not up to the government to decide what information is made public and what stays private yet there seem to be different rules for memoirs if i were a minister or a civil servant writing my memoirs i would think it was reasonable for government to suggest changes i should make for public interest reasons but not for it to censor me
1148749 horrible worse than school and locked in all the time
1148750 it is hard work although we are very free we have to work hard too but you can work when you like
1148751 english is no doss either you have to do an author a week from the year 1100 to the present day that means you have to read a book a day at least seven books a week it means working seven hours a day
1148752 if you were at an interview what could you say you all have that children from private schools dont have
1148753 think well i can tell you what you should say just think what you all have to do to get three as at a level compared with private school kids how many of you have nowhere quiet to work
1148754 how many of you have only learned to speak english in the last few years
1148755 how many of you had very little school experience before you came to our school
1148756 do you have people at home to push and help you people to pay for extra lessons no so you will have got your a levels because of your own efforts in spite of difficulties that those private school kids never even thought of
1148757 when you get to university you will all have plenty of untapped potential but maybe those pupils crammed to the eyeballs in private schools may never get any better you will have proved you can work hard in hard circumstances with no spoon feeding you know what it is to work despite a lot of distraction and lots of temptations
1148758 niace believes that the format of the programme over inflates the opinions of a single charismatic but poorly informed presenter and is unhelpfully simplistic
1148759 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think their child is a healthy weight
1148760 this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1148761 we have to get the balance right between being a nanny state and a neglectful state
1148762 use of the word obese shuts people down they associate it with 10 tonne mums and half tonne kids we have not banned it but we have chosen not to use it theres no point giving them a letter that does not have any impact on their behaviour
1148763 i find this particular line from the government to be tiptoeing through the daffodils
1148764 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice its a nasty word but by god it should sound alarm bells in parents minds
1148765 i find this whole approach from the department of health a bit prissy and namby pamby
1148766 school nurses can make a real difference in helping children develop healthy habits but the government has failed to address the chronic shortage of school nurses
1148767 if ministers are serious about their plans to tackle child obesity then they should use this opportunity to really highlight the health risks it causes
1148768 unless these letters are accompanied by practical help then they will be a waste of time and resources
1148769 is one of the most intensively studied anuran species worldwide it is thus remarkable that the distinctive toe waving behaviour of this species has not been reported in earlier literature
1148770 and found that other cane toads made up 64 of the total of 149 prey items
1148771 the kinematics of toe waving behaviour by captive cane toads
1148772 bursts of rapid toe waving punctuated by periods of slower toe waving
1148773 to simulate the waving toe of a toad we amputated the longest toe of the rear foot from a dummy toad a taxidermic mount from a dead animal
1148774 appears to be no good evidence that broken windows policing reduces crime nor evidence that changing the desired intermediate output of broken windows policing disorder itself is sufficient to affect changes in criminal behaviour

1148784 synthetic phonics offers the vast majority the best and most direct route to becoming skilled readers and writers
1148785 hes good at giving ministers what they want but not necessarily what they need
1148786 he has both considerable integrity and a pragmatic sense of whats going to work he can take on board a range of entrenched opinions and yet reach a consensus
1148787 hes worldly wise he knows what he can get away with
1148788 strengthen their schools focus on raising standards in reading writing and numeracy
1148789 just extend one backwards the other forwards tie a knot in the middle and say thats primary education
1148790 his is a no holds barred look at primary education mine is simply the curriculum the what rather than the how or the measurement thereof ive met robin on several occasions and weve shared thoughts
1148791 had this thing about open plan buildings and childrens choices driving the curriculum and some of that was very difficult to swallow it was a denial of what children are capable of
1148792 we had these youngsters coming in who had to learn english as an additional language there was no way in which you could give them a diet which was just real books
1148793 he was ahead of most of us in recognising the role of phonics
1148794 we used to joke that if a pe lesson was to get a good rating it should include phonics
1148795 i say that synthetic phonics is the best demonstration of systematic practice i dont really see how children can get a foothold in reading unless they understand how the alphabet works and can do the coding and decoding anybody who thinks they will just discover that decoding system is really way off beam but phonics isnt the be all and end all its essential but not sufficient
1148796 far more attention needs to be given right from the start
1148797 synthetic phonics the first strategy in teaching all children to read
1148798 its very difficult when people are so shrill not to be identified with the shrillness rather than the content the reading wars separated out the rival factions very strongly it was megaphone communication across a wide gap
1148799 we hoped jim would speak out at least in a coded way but he didnt counter woodhead at all even internally
1148800 my job was to try and tell it as it is and remember the goal is to better childrens education whatever else chris woodhead did he gave the nation a wake up call on certain issues he may well have gone too far in terms of confrontation thats the naature of chris woodhead
1148801 not rows in that sense but i tried to get more evidence together before we took positions you had to test findings very carefully on the 15 000 teachers who woodhead announced were incompetent for example it was that kind of thing where you really had to fight your corner to make sure what you were saying had some reliability behind it
1148802 no not resigning no no i dont think i did ever actually think of resigning i probably considered whether there might be other posts
1148803 the founders fund and accel partners the vc firms that provide the money for fbfund
1148804 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
1148805 to save thousands of lives before its too late we would like to urge the united nations and foreign governments to intervene in burma immediately to provide humanitarian and relief assistance directly to the people of burma without waiting for the permission of the military junta with a decision made by the un security council or individual country
1148806 both of us were in pretty good shape for these matches but i had the mental belief that i could win and once you win against someone for the first time you have the feeling that you can do it again and again
1148807 i think it also gets into their heads if they beat you five or six times and you come back to win against them winning a masters series event is tough and it will be hard to follow that up but it gives you a lot of confidence knowing that you can do it
1148808 the first three times i played him djokovic i wasnt in such good physical shape he killed me in monte carlo but this time i was in good shape if you put the work in off the court then you can eliminate all the possible excuses and just go into the match not thinking about physical shape and how much practice you have put in
1148809 id rather be in the position im in now than going over there having been knocked out in the first round at cincinnati
1148810 now i feel absolutely fine both physically and mentally im not fatigued at all
1148811 it pops in at a difficult time in the tennis calendar right after two masters series events and right before the last grand slam of the year so its really tough and its a long way to travel as well so i think its going to be really difficult for tennis players i think anybody who does well at the olympics is unlikely to do well at the us open
1148812 he likes to challenge us on a daily basis theres a lot of strong characters in the dressing room yesterday i sat down with peter and we had a really good discussion about how we want to take this team forward we need to unite we need to get on to the same hymnsheet we need to get this team going forward the crux of yesterdays meeting was to determine where peter and myself can take this team
1148813 im 100 confident we can have a good working relationship i wouldnt be sitting here today if i wasnt confident everything is going to be perfectly fine
1148814 to be totally honest the most exciting thing is that ive had text messages and phone calls from the senior players in the squad who basically said were right behind you we support you give it a shot
1148815 once youve got the support of the lads around you who are with you the whole time theres nothing more you can ask for i hope it wont restrict the way i play i play the way i play and ive been successful so far if it doesnt work and it affects a few things in terms of my personal life if it affects the way i bat and all that then i will be man enough to say so
1148816 i was disappointed i wasnt thought of as captain but once the selectors decided they wanted to unify the test and one day jobs it was a non starter for me
1148817 i definitely feel i could have made a decent fist of the test captaincy and would have benefited from the time i previously did the job but it was not to be and there is not much i can do about the selectors decision there is no point feeling sorry for myself what i have to do now is get behind kevin
1148818 it crossed my mind for a couple of minutes that i may get the job but i probably am too young
1148819 hungary showed they had some really strong pace which we already knew they had
1148820 i think i drove well i didnt make any mistakes i just had a puncture i brought the car home as safe as possible and scored as many points as i could
1148821 its just unfortunate i was the one to get a puncture i had it three times last year and thats what really lost me the championship it can be very costly but kimi raikkonen didnt win and it actually helps heikki kovalainen has won and glock was second they are taking points off everyone else so im quite happy
1148822 i had one of my best ever starts but felipe had an even better one it wont happen again
1148823 i have had nightmares in the last couple of weeks
1148824 i had to be rushed into emergency and i couldnt walk on my foot for two days it was a poisonous spider
1148825 we went back home at night and i had a really bad fever i woke up in the night and couldnt stand on my foot by the morning my foot was like a red balloon and i had a red line all the way up inside my leg
1148826 i was thinking that somebody somewhere had a little doll and was sticking pins in but something like that just makes you more determined to fight it off they thought i might need an iv drip but in the end i had to have strong oral medicine i couldnt put my foot down and couldnt run for four days i still have scabs and have lost all the skin around my toe
1148827 you cant make a definite decision because im running on a leg that could break down
1148828 every time i go out i am planning to start the race and run well there have been lots of points where i thought am i going to make it
1148829 i wouldnt be here if i didnt think i was in good enough shape
1148830 i know from what i have done that i am good enough to be on the start line im racing unless my leg breaks down and i cant run that has already been decided
1148831 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games
1148832 i was having breakfast at about 8am when i heard two or three loud bangs they sounded like a car backfiring so i didnt pay much attention until later when i heard some police had been killed
1148833 ahead of the olympics it is a very powerful symbolic attack because security in xinjiang is at an all time high
1148834 theres an independence movement but i dont expect it to succeed and dont expect many people will want to take part because they expect it to fail and know the result will be more repression
1148835 our route for today is to start at the widest part of the lake and swim to a nearby island before getting out and having a little hike then swimming back to the start
1148836 with swimhiking you are freed from the constraints of hiking on foot rivers and lakes become a barrier but if you swimhike you can go much further or at least in more directions
1148837 ive only made a few prototypes but it means im not tied to the spot where i would have left my clothes dogs would do their business on my clothes and kids would steal them though the worst was when a public spirited citizen saw my bundle of clothes and told the police i had committed suicide
1148838 you build up a sweat on land then cool off in the water but i also think its fun in the rain when youre walking and the raindrops hit your clothes its frustrating but if youre in the lake theres water all around anyway so it feels natural
1148839 is that you are mixing land and water so you feel a bit like james bond and tarzan
1148840 it makes people really happy theres something about bobbing around free from gravity in wide open spaces it doesnt cost a thing and it gives you the chance to see the country in a fresh new way
1148841 most people find that they can only stay in a pool for 20 minutes before getting bored but up to an hour or more if they are swimming outdoors if you then combine that with hiking youre getting a real cardiovascular workout
1148842 the current position is as per justins press statement on friday night
1148843 i was made aware of the reasons why paul had not been selected for the hull fc game and the reasons he wasnt selected for the catalans game i am fully supportive of the coachs stance i havent yet had the chance to speak to either the coach or the player to plot where were going but it is on the radar for this week
1148844 we havent set a timescale but this cant run and run because it is very distracting
1148845 a bidder may bid for part only of any package eg two test matches or whatever taking place in each season however any such bid must be for the full duration of the contract
1148846 does not inspire much confidence in the bbcs commitment to cricket
1148847 i said at the outset that these games would be historic they are already a landmark the mere fact that they are coming to china home to nearly 20 of the worlds population is significant
1148848 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
1148849 the olympic movement should constantly seek to bridge the gap between developed and developing countries by promoting sport and our olympic values the olympic rings are a powerful symbol recognised worldwide because they represent a set of universal values
1148850 it is our hope that through the games we can show the world the sincere aspiration of the chinese people to share in the benefits of development and to join with the rest of the world in building a bright future
1148851 in 1993 they had bid for the 2000 games that were won by sydney and at that time the theory was that they were not ready
1148852 they stayed away from the athens round of bidding to address the issues and by the time the 2001 bidding came round the feeling was that they deserved the chance ultimately the members were asked to decide how they could say no to a country that is home to a fifth of the worlds population
1148853 the challenge for china has been the degree of interest in other areas of society that the games has brought china has had to deal with political inquiries from the very start the ioc will claim that this has been a good and helpful process and that the olympics have hastened the process of change in china
1148854 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him
1148855 hes got incredible skill has magic in his feet and is capable of anything on a football pitch his quality is amazing it would be great if he joined us and hed be made very welcome here
1148856 everybody wants to see good football and in fact the first rule for winning football is to make sure we play well
1148857 this team has players with great quality who can play high calibre football good quality and exciting football
1148858 this pre season tour has been a really good way for me to get to know my team mates and ive felt really comfortable out on the pitch its only the beginning for me at this club but ive been really pleased with the way things have gone so far its been easier for me to settle in when im surrounded by the players of the quality we have here that was always going to make it easier for me to adapt
1148859 i think we can play all together but i dont really think its important who is going to play
1148860 the important thing is that whoever is selected plays well weve got so many games to come this season and im sure i wont play all of them ill be rested from time to time but as i said it is about whoever is selected doing well
1148861 we showed against real madrid that ade and i have a few nice combinations together
1148862 i think any of the top four can win the title
1148863 i am not going to say we are going to win it because you never know they do not know we do not know either but i hope we can do it i am committed to win it and if you look around so is everyone here
1148864 arsenal have to win something every year that is our aim
1148865 the news report is completely false and baseless there are no such plans
1148866 michaels training is going really well and he should be ready to join the group this week
1148867 the psv game may be too early for him but the valencia game is a possibility
1148868 for us it is about getting up to a competitive level and we havent done that so far we havent played with the edge to our game that we will require to get through
1148869 the meetings can be a bit lively but overall what he ferguson is doing is in the interests of manchester united and thats what he always thinks of in those meetings if he wants to keep the player hell do everything he can to do so and hell probably succeed as well
1148870 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have a problem about him coming here the gal cticos are the past i think the best of real madrid now is the group and the dressing room
1148871 if he comes he will excite the fans for sure at the bernab u the supporters are used to watching all the best players in the world and cristiano ronaldo is now one of the best players in the world
1148872 we cannae have that in the middle of winter my lads will catch the flu
1148873 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift its not just a new face we need its new faces
1148874 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle im hoping we will have some in before the start of the season but im not going to turn around and say i am totally confident because you never know what happens
1148875 we were prepared to welcome proposals for a long term relationship with a new substantial investor to help establish west brom as a successful premier league club
1148876 we said we would shut the door on this at the end of july because we did not want anything off the pitch impacting on the new season there has been some initial contact from a few third parties but we have received no firm proposals whatsoever
1148877 it is a nonsense for anyone to suggest a transfer cannot be processed simply because i am not in attendance
1148878 i was away from the office for a few hours on wednesday afternoon but i was available by phone and there were two directors present who could have completed the deal if it had been possible to do so however the player and his representatives did not return the following day and we were later informed that he had decided to join rangers
1148879 it is likely to lead to high profile litigation during a time when the response to terrorism will be a matter of high controversy
1148880 we are concerned that parliament would be asked to make decisions that it is institutionally ill equipped to determine
1148881 i always find it interesting when people use maritime analogies when they talk about leadership but it wasnt the captain that sank the titanic a ship they claimed was unsinkable it was the iceberg the best way to avoid disaster is to manage your way around the problem
1148882 speaking as someone whos served on a ship and in a leadership the best person to steer us through is a captain with the experience to navigate through these stormy financial global seas
1148883 we feel it is consistent with the governments approach that it wants to listen and learn from the experiences of people in this country
1148884 you were found guilty of the culpable homicide of your wife who you were together with for many years in normal circumstances this would attract a prison sentence in double figures i have read and considered a number of reports from experts
1148885 it is plain to me that if i were to impose that sort of sentence you would be released in a very short time because prison would not be able to cope with your condition sentencing you would just be a token gesture i am anxious to impose a sentence that restricts your liberty
1148886 you still go to the pub where you went with your wife that must annoy her relatives not being able to go there will be a more meaningful disposal than a prison sentence which will not last long
1148887 it must have been me there are no ghosts running about the house who would have done that
1148888 there is a clear diagnosis of dementia setting in it is a progressive condition and ultimately he will need 24 hour care
1148889 police are investigating the arrival of campaigners believed to have breached their bail conditions but we cannot confirm how many arrests have been made
1148890 im pretty nervous about being arrested because ive never been to prison it will be bad but the worst thing about being arrested will be that i wont get to go to an event that i have been planning for a long time this is one of the most important issues of our generation and its vital that we are allowed to discuss it its tragic that the police seem to want to stop that

1149007 a lot of young women are just at the beginning of their careers maybe not married yet or just newly married or have young children so its a matter of dealing with intimacy and relationships sexuality and body image and fertility
1149008 i think that its important for young women to have information about freezing their eggs in case they want to have children after treatment

1149033 starbucks has done very well in international markets where there has not traditionally been a coffee drinking culture
1149034 starbucks is one of the nicest coffees that ive tried
1149035 its a stronger taste which i like its a unique experience and its renowned for being good which is why people love it
1149036 its okay but there are privately owned cafes that id rather go to

1149149 this job is killing me its eating all the time and there is nothing in return other than that measly amount of money you get at the end of the month
1149150 its really getting to me now what ive tried was automating our tasks the people at work manually do a lot of stuff that can be easily automated but i get no appreciation from my manager for what ive done
1149151 managers hardly appreciate people anyhow its just partiality towards the people they like
1149152 tell me about it do you know that the people who are close to the hr get better increments
1149153 ha ha ha what im trying now is hardly working no more working hard for me what ive realized is that they still have to pay me the monthly salary the only thing ill be missing is my bonus and im willing to forgo that
1149154 hallelujah finally someone else feels like i do i really feel i am working in a government job my place the hr runs after the girls at work doesnt really care about the other employees and that why everything is suffering i guess
1149155 you know from what ive realized you can either have good work or a good pay both hardly go hand in hand
1149156 thats bullshit many places have both they are just harder to find
1149157 you know what im going to do ive going to enjoy my work now and when ive had enough around 3 years down the line ive going for the pay
1149158 what are we working so hard for and who do we really work for

1149160 but tell me why do i see a mail from john doe who is sitting miles away and who i have never met in person and then run around doing what he asks its really pathetic
1149161 i know but thats just the way it is probably you will do the same when you are higher up on the ladder

1149163 it does not make sense to me right now the job gives me assured income
1149164 now is the time for taking the risk dont tell me you would want to take a risk when you have a family that you need to support
1149165 true but im still learning the ropes and plus the job offers me a place to network and meet people something i would need later on in life
1149166 aha so youre stuck in the place because of the comforts that you get you are nothing but a wage slave

1149273 consumers are changing their buying habits its making more financial sense for some of them to repair older vehicles instead of purchasing new ones where they would have to worry about expensive monthly car payments and of course the increased gas prices
1149274 many people have felt the effects of the economic downturn for the past several months and they are making changes in their buying choices so that they can hold on to more of their money when they compare the costs of buying a new car and repairing an old one they see a big difference
1149275 the new behavior fueled by higher gas and food prices tightening credit and a slumping housing market is the most dramatic and widespread that they have seen since the mid 1970s

1149294 the participants in the defense in dimension roundtable bring a wealth of diversity and depth of experience and perspective to the discussion
1149295 in working with both the supply and demand side of cybersecurity i see the roundtable as a real source of best thinking and i look forward to my role in the roundtable to center the discussion on closing the gap between the arsenal of cybersecurity tools available to the organizations echelon one works with and the pressing operational and governance needs they have

1149315 the first two months of the quarter were generally in line with our expectations but took a noticeable downturn in june reflecting the worsening economy
1149316 our portfolio as a whole held its own with same store revenue per available room revpar down 0 6 percent in the quarter
1149317 we had mixed revpar results in our three segments reflecting economic and weather conditions our 56 same store economy hotels which account for about 60 percent of our same store portfolio performed quite well with revpar up a strong 3 9 percent compared to an industry decline of 2 0 percent for that segment according to smith travel research average daily rate adr improved 1 1 percent and occupancy rose 2 8 percent our leisure travel remained strong throughout the quarter while business and construction related travel softened
1149318 our seven same store extended stay properties were hardest hit revpar was down 6 9 percent with occupancy declining 2 0 percent and adr off 5 0 percent the lower results at our extended stay properties were largely due to the sharp drop off in construction and contract activity which together account for a substantial portion of our guest base for those hotels especially in the southeast we believe that this base of business will return to more normal levels once this economic slowdown works through its cycle
1149319 the performance of these acquisitions in the 2008 second quarter occurred in a slow economic environment with a fairly robust economic environment in effect for the same quarter of 2007 the sluggish economy in 2008 compared to last year impacted operating performance and resulted in the total portfolio revpar being down 5 0 percent driven largely by a 4 2 percent decline in occupancy again we are confident the guest base for our south atlantic properties will revert to more historic norms once the current economic slowdown runs through its cycle
1149320 with a decline in top line revenues it was difficult maintaining our margins but our operators did a good job with same store margins declining slightly from 32 7 percent to 32 3 percent
1149321 we have made improvements in controlling our variable labor costs but fixed labor costs are a factor even in a period of slower revenue growth and we continue to experience rising energy costs our operators worked very hard to control variable costs and overall performed well in difficult economic conditions the recent decline in oil prices has not had a material impact on energy costs but a continuation of falling oil prices would be a positive we continue to evaluate energy saving solutions and are sharing best practices among our hotels
1149322 this transaction locks in attractive rates for the next eight years and adds stability to our balance sheet
1149323 our dividend remains well covered and our board will continue to evaluate our payout policy on a quarterly basis
1149324 we expect the hotel economy to continue to be challenging for at least the next few quarters
1149325 in addition there is new supply coming on line through most of 2009 however these levels are not anywhere near as high as they have been in recent cycles a lot of development projects have been halted or delayed which will have a positive impact on the supply demand ratio by 2010
1149326 our portfolio is in good physical shape and our management companies are doing a much better job of controlling costs while working to increase top line revenues
1149327 we continue to work closely with them as we pursue our common goal of improving the operating performance of our hotels
1149328 pricing is improving and we expect more properties at more favorable pricing to come to market over the next 12 months we feel no pressure to acquire at this time our dividend and balance sheet are in solid shape but we remain flexible to respond to unique opportunities while we have not been a recent seller of properties we continuously review our portfolio to look for opportunities to sell and redeploy those funds in higher return assets
1149329 the ability to see each wal mart store indexed within iri or nielsen markets allows a wal mart category management team to isolate over and under performing stores with causal information cpg vision brings a 3800 line spreadsheet to life
1149330 our performance tells the story of our focused commitment to the needs of the professional traders hedge funds and money managers we serve and in our experience key drivers for this audience are choice and flexibility
1149331 this quarter compared to the same quarter last year the number of users and trades from our proprietary tradient trading platforms increased by 168 and 465 respectively and the software services segment reported overall earnings growth of 193 in part due to the lower routing costs of this platform we see this as validation that developing and marketing a broadened range of technology offerings is a strategy with both revenue and bottom line benefits and we are excited about the momentum we are gaining by executing on this strategy after emerging from a period of change and reorganization
1149332 overall market softness in the second quarter had an unavoidable effect on our brokerage revenue
1149333 however adding the compelling new tradient pro release to our proprietary technology trading platform available to clients has played a significant role in expense control impacting margins
1149334 having turned the corner to post a swift upturn in revenue and profitability this quarter our technology development group has demonstrated just a glimpse of its potential
1149335 a continued focus on value driven innovation software speed and time to market will continue to fuel financial performance

1149384 by participating in the scheduled departure program those who have had their day in court and have been ordered to leave the country have an opportunity to comply with the law and gain control of how their families are affected by their removal
1149385 its not realistic and its kind of ridiculous they would come up with this idea

1149400 the occoc has been a major user of our infotool performance diagnostics survey technology since 2005 and we are thrilled to share in the success that our mutual efforts have garnered for this outstanding organization
1149401 under the leadership of clerk lydia gardner and hr director ceretha leon the occoc has turned conventional thinking about ineffectual government organizations on its head
1149402 they provide a level of public service and financial stewardship that most corporations would envy
1149403 these are the key success factors that we at infotool continually ask our clients to assess and improve
1149404 the infotool was created to help organizations benchmark evaluate track and create action plans around improvement in these critical areas the success that occoc has achieved in becoming a high performance organization proves that what we say works
1149405 alignment from top to bottom between the balanced scorecard and supporting strategic objectives performance measures and initiatives is what makes the system work
1149406 we had employed an annual survey in past years but infotool made the job simpler and easier and we were able to dissect the results at a deeper level
1149407 since partnering with medicalmessaging net last year we have seen rapid athenahealth customer uptake as well as the tremendous value that their service can add to our clients when combined with our core offering
1149408 we see enormous value in joining forces to bring our service offerings to the next level and to fully exploit opportunities going forward
1149409 in purchasing the assets of medicalmessaging net we add not only a well developed service capability but also a great team that we welcome into the athenahealth family
1149410 athenahealth has emerged as a truly disruptive presence in the ambulatory market and is at the forefront of driving consistent and improved operational and clinical outcomes for physician groups
1149411 by embedding our services into the athenahealth network we will look to deliver value in ways that currently are unavailable in the market we feel that there is a tremendous opportunity to leverage athenahealths software enabled service offerings for new and existing clients allowing physician practices to automate patient communications in an increasingly consumer centric health care environment giving their patients access to timely and critical personal healthcare information

1149418 either candidate can be expected to serve two full terms without age or health being an issue

1149421 the people of america need to know their president will stay healthy
1149422 it is a public service to show the health expectancy of the two candidates
1149423 it might be valuable to profile other major political candidates
1149424 this evaluation is profoundly serious and must be done for serious reasons only

1149436 tenemos un problema de d ficit en la educaci n del m dico para que atienda pacientes con vih sida ese es el problema para que pueda canalizarlos al lugar adecuado

1149441 no he recibido un curso como tal nadie me lo ha ofrecido hace no mucho nos pusieron unas diapositivas que hablaban un poquito sobre discriminaci n por vih pero muy superficial
1149442 no nos han ense ado que a cada paciente le preguntemos factores de riesgo sobre vih no nos han ense ado a tener un ojo cl nico y pensar en el sida porque actualmente nosotros que trabajamos en el seguro social vemos lo m s inmediato
1149443 de parte del instituto no tenemos una rotaci n ni siquiera por infectolog a hay cierto retraso en el diagn stico y en eso influye mucho la capacitaci n que hemos llevado nosotros como m dicos familiares y como m dicos generales tambi n
1149444 obviamente a diario se te va formando el ojo cl nico y cuando te vas encontrado con los pacientes y mencionan esos datos de alarma se nos prenden los focos rojos y empezamos a estudiarlos pero la verdad es que no hacemos un procedimiento preventivo simplemente estamos alerta para cuando el paciente se queje para poder pensar en que puede tener vih y mandarlo a hacerse una prueba de elisa
1149445 recuerdo que en el estado de m xico lleg s lo una persona el n mero de respuesta era terriblemente bajo y entonces no se contrataba al que tuviera el mayor conocimiento sino al que tuviera la disposici n
1149446 est demostrado cient ficamente que la buena evoluci n de un paciente o que la sobrevida de un paciente con vih no solamente depende del acceso a medicamentos antirretrovirales sino tambi n depende mucho de la experiencia que tenga el m dico en su manejo
1149447 porque para atender a un paciente con infecci n por vih el m dico necesita tener conocimiento de la enfermedad su evoluci n y de las complicaciones que puede tener y adem s debe tener una experiencia m nima en el manejo de estos nuevos antirretrovirales
1149448 a lo mejor adem s hay infect logos que no tienen tantas ganas de irse a trabajar a los capasits pero si hay infect logos tenemos m dicos internistas
1149449 y por supuesto el m dico necesita cursos de capacitaci n pero que se adecuen a sus condiciones laborales un m dico no se puede aislar demasiado tiempo no puede dejar lo que est haciendo e ir a un curso por eso hemos migrado hacia cursos presenciales cortos y cursos virtuales que el m dico puede estar llevando una hora al d a yo creo que un m dico siempre tiene que estar en capacitaci n
1149450 the prime ministers emphasis like mine is how we can strengthen the trans atlantic relationship solve problems that cant be solved by any single country individually climate change the issue of international terrorism some of the issues surrounding financial markets

1149453 some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals as if some ingenious argument will persuade them

1149455 i have some news for senator obama talking not even with soaring rhetoric in unconditional meetings with the man who calls israel a stinking corpse and arms terrorists who kill americans will not convince iran to give up its nuclear program
1149456 it would be a wonderful thing if we lived in a world where we dont have enemies but that is not the world we live in and until senator obama understands that reality the american people have every reason to doubt whether he has the strength judgment and determination to keep us safe
1149457 if george bush and john mccain want to have a debate about protecting the united states of america that is a debate that im happy to have anytime anyplace and that is a debate i will win because george bush and john mccain have a lot to answer for
1149458 the greatest threat to america and israel and the middle east in a generation
1149459 thats the bush mccain record on protecting this country those are the failed policies that john mccain wants to double down on
1149460 i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union
1149461 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union

1149464 they never gave her any of the proper medications for her aids diagnosis they did give her a prescription for a urinary tract infection but even then they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end

1149490 in a slow real estate market like this one its remarkable to have 10 people lined up to compete for any kind of property so were very happy with the outcome
1149491 with a specialized property like this it was important to cast a wide net so having bidders from as far away as florida and michigan lets us know we did our job
1149492 mr tumbleson owns several other hunting properties and from what i understand he plans to use this as a private hunting club
1149493 i wonder who leases and maintains these planes and how much work is involved in keeping the airplane in good working order

1149497 sales to the defense department will show modest gains in 2007 from funds already appropriated obviously a new congress events in iraq and new management at dod will affect the composition and value of defense programs in fiscal 08 and beyond
1149498 as for exports foreign sales of aerospace products jumped sharply for a second year totaling nearly 85 2 billion an increase of 18 billion over the previous years 67 billion the increase is dominated by civil aircraft exports particularly commercial transports which increased from 28 billion to nearly 38 billion general aviation aircraft exports also enjoyed another good year increasing by a third to 3 2 billion again setting a new record military aircraft exports experienced a healthy 40 increase to 3 4 billion although in absolute terms military exports only account for 15 of total aerospace exports
1149499 looking beyond 2007 the current backlog of commercial aircraft orders gives us confidence that the civil aircraft sector will continue on an upward trajectory for at least an additional three or four years
1149500 we see significant opportunity for aar in european markets as regional carriers become more prevalent and as new and existing commercial carriers and defense forces look to operate more efficiently and effectively

1149505 seeing the amazon from the plane is an amazing experience
1149506 seeing two amazonian indians from opposite sides of the amazon meet and embrace for the first time was a powerful moment for me they communicated easily with smiles and embraces but speaking proved quite challenging wuta left a cartographer for tiriy chief almirs father maribop surui right speaks tupi monde the native language of the surui as maribop spoke almir translated to portuguese then vasco would translate to english and then skappie wutas surinamese colleague would finally speak tiriy to wuta despite this game of telephone i could see from their faces that they shared a common bond that goes very deep
1149507 as our training session started off i scanned the room to gauge the students levels of knowledge it was clear that some students are more comfortable than others a few minutes into the session i noticed a group of four women sitting quietly staring at their monitors and not participating in the training exercises i investigated and learned that they were not familiar with the mouse or the other strange equipment that is such an everyday part of my life a fellow instructor eduardo focused his attention on them while i continued the training at the end of the day i witnessed something that made me feel both proud and sad all four women were chatting away on the internet searching moving the mice as if it were something they had always known smiles all around no sense of apprehension the net had found four more addicts

1149518 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china
1149519 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the
1149520 some of the changes are easy to see the birds nest the main stadium and the water cube the swimming complex are already architectural landmarks
1149521 long after the games end these and other olympic venues will encourage the youth of china to participate in sport spectators will be inspired to become athletes and athletes will be inspired to achieve their best in world class venues
1149522 the venues are just a small part of the construction legacy that will benefit china after the games
1149523 new airport terminals new roads and highways new parks and a host of other projects that were initiated or accelerated because of the games will improve the quality of life and contribute to chinas economic development over the long term
1149524 many of the infrastructure investments and other steps taken as a result of the olympics will help china deal with environmental challenges
1149525 chinas role as our olympic host has opened a window to the worlds most populous nation
1149526 we have already seen the courage and determination of the
1149527 the world mourned the staggering loss of life from the earthquake in sichuan province and marveled at the courageous response by the chinese people
1149528 starting this weekend and over the next 16 days the world will have another reason to come together to share common emotions beijing games will help the healing process in china and deepen the worlds knowledge of this remarkable country
1149529 i said at the outset that i believe these games will be historic
1149530 they are already a landmark event for the olympic movement
1149531 a billion television viewers are expected to watch live coverage of the opening ceremony on friday
1149532 the beijing games will significantly advance our goals of universality and fair play in several ways
1149533 we will see a record number of participating national teams 205 and a record number of women athletes about 45 percent of all the competitors
1149534 an unprecedented effort against doping with more stringent testing then ever before and new steps to combat irregular betting including closer co operation with law enforcement
1149535 the changes that are occurring in china are a microcosm of the changes in the rest of the world
1149536 the olympic movement has overcome countless obstacles since pierre de coubertin founded the international olympic committee in 1894 and we will have to continue to keep the olympic dream alive for future generations
1149537 well it was good seeing you take care of yourself g w
1149538 i dont think you beat obama by saying that hes paris hilton
1149539 the more important thing is really to look at is he who he says he is is he really this great reformer
1149540 convinced that the olympic games will improve human rights in china
1149541 theres still a strong perception in the west that the chinese are oppressed
1149542 the protests weve seen about chinas human rights record ahead of the olympics will only have increased that sense
1149543 theres not much evidence here of a desire to blame china for the big global problems were currently faced with like rising energy prices or food prices
1149544 and its surprising that despite all the concern about the growth in chinas carbon emissions its people in the other big emerging economies like brazil or india that are more likely to blame china for climate change
1149545 weve seen support for globalisation drop off in recent years around the world and this may be more evidence of people in the west worrying about jobs disappearing into lower wage economies in the developing world
1149546 maybe one of the most surprising things in the poll is that even though china as a country has been isolated from the outside world for such a long time majorities in britain the us and india still see the chinese as friendly and over half in the us and britain think that the chinese are like them
1149547 as a country deeply invested in the global economic system china would benefit from playing an increasingly proactive role in global economic decision making
1149548 and yet it seems to be doing the opposite in the doha round of international trade negotiations
1149549 its insistence on protecting its own industrial development is driving other countries to do the same and has been a major factor in the growing anti globalization and protectionist sentiment around the world

1149557 there could be toxic smoke that could hurt or maybe even kill people in there
1149558 the occupant load in this building is over 500 at one time and smoke is the number one killer not flames and if that is allowed to go through the building unprotected we could have a potential disaster on our hands
1149559 because the state theatre is not changing the intended use of the building it was built as a movie theatre its to be used as a movie theatre they are grandfathered into the codes originally built

1149564 there is no sure way to settle on a date by which the office of ruling bishop had emerged in rome and so to name the first pope but the process was certainly complete by the time of anicetus in the mid 150s when polycarp the aged bishop of smyrna visited rome and he and anicetus debated amicably the question of the date of easter

1149572 i will speak in the bitterness of my soul i will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefore thou contendest with me
1149573 and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and wept sore
1149574 esta es la primera vez que una red social a escala planetaria ha logrado validar la teor a de los seis grados de separaci n
1149575 looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled
1149576 the lord said also unto me in the days of josiah the king hast thou seen that which backsliding israel hath done she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree and there hath played the harlot
1149577 he hath filled me with bitterness he hath made me drunken with wormwood
1149578 this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish
1149579 for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth
1149580 this has been a short intense five months in which perhaps some of the mourning has been diverted as we sought these changes
1149581 we realize there are going to have to be several things to reduce and eradicate domestic violence
1149582 this in and of itself will not be the total solution
1149583 now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amittai saying arise go to ninevah that great city and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me
1149584 but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken
1149585 then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them but jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep
1149586 so the shipmaster came to him and said unto him what meanest thou o sleeper arise call upon thy god if so be that god will think upon us that we perish not
1149587 now the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights
1149588 then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fishs belly
1149589 and said i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heardest my voice
1149590 then i said i am cast out of thy sight yet i will look again toward thy holy temple
1149591 but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven
1149592 and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst
1149593 and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this
1149594 and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
1149595 for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee
1149596 and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
1149597 arise go to ninevah that great city and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord
1149598 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
1149599 but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord

1149612 enemies know that we are easily able to block the strait of hormuz for an unlimited period
1149613 the strait and vessels are in range of our various weapons

1149615 you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration

1149636 why should they give bashir 12 months of grace when in 5 years we have not known one day of peace
1149637 my hope for the future is that there will be peace in darfur so that we can go home for there to be peace the president of sudan must be arrested and taken to court he has caused so much suffering omar al bashir has killed children he has bombed us and terrified us he should be taken and executed
1149638 the rebels formed when people of darfur began to understand they have no rights al bashir is trying to kill the people not just the rebels he is bombing civilians
1149639 not only al bashir but 52 more should be taken to court
1149640 we want two things peace in sudan and punishment for al bashir and all the criminals who have done this to us
1149641 we need security and peace security cannot be delivered by the au they have watched us die for 5 years and we need not the hybrid but an international peacekeeping force we need compensation representation in government punishment for al bashir

1149660 we orthodox jews are not too strict the talmud is only 5 422 pages long
1149661 first of all it is worth noting that sj seems to feel that such trivialities as spelling grammar and punctuation are for the birds fine but he also seems to feel similarly about clear thinking and reasoning
1149662 let us presume that god intended judaism to be a judaism that the majority of jews can follow with minimum difficulty let us presume that god intended judaism to be a judaism that the majority of jews can follow with minimum difficulty any more difficulty beyond the minimum would be self flagellation and self flagellation is retarded

1149678 its time for the legislative republicans to tell the public how they would balance the budget
1149679 i am a governor that does not believe that the action is in sacramento and sitting around an office that is not going to do anyone any good
1149680 getting the legislators to finish the budget without pressure from the corner office is like getting teenagers to come home early without a curfew
1149681 the state of california the elected leadership cannot put the important public servants of california in harms way
1149682 we put people first we make sure we protect their interests and thats why i have to tell the governor with all due respect i am not going to comply with this order

1149694 because i suppose i realized that i had about as much to do with my call as god did
1149695 i speak to you as a human being about the holy mysteries of humanity according to my view that which has been the innermost mainspring of my existence ever since i have thought and been alive that i speak does not originate from a rational decision or from hope or fear nor does it happen in accord with some final purpose or for some arbitrary or accidental reason it is the inner irresistible necessity of my nature it is a divine calling it is that which determines my place in the universe and makes me the being i am even if it were neither suitable nor prudent to speak of religion the thing that thus drives me crushes these petty notions with its heavenly power
1149696 in the beginning the church was a fellowship of men and women centering on the living christ then the church moved to greece where it became a philosophy then it moved to rome where it became an institution next it moved to europe where it became a culture and finally it moved to america where it became an enterprise
1149697 dear boy what do we know of the idea of the divine and what can our narrow conceptions presume to tell of the supreme being if i called him by a hundred names like a turk i should yet fall short and have said nothing in comparison to the boundlessness of his attributes
1149698 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were

1149717 im determined to stand up for the many local residents whove contacted me over this issue those who depend on the service as well as those who have worked hard often over many years to help our older and disabled neighbours deserve our support
1149718 and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou here elijah and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away
1149719 then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time
1149720 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour
1149721 but he himself went a days journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my life for i am not better than my fathers
1149722 and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat
1149723 and he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coals and a cruse of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again
1149724 and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee
1149725 and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here elijah
1149726 and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away
1149727 yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him
1149728 and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there
1149729 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
1149730 so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him

1149735 e stata una scelta ponderata nel senso che mai sarei andato b ma a parma s perch una questione di programmazione di societ
1149736 sono venuto a parma per questo motivo come ho detto la programmazione quella e infatti mi stato fatto un contratto biennale e quindi io penso e spero proprio che lanno prossimo possa essere a parma in a
1149737 mah io ho fatto delle richieste per quanto riguarda i ruoli mi stato detto che cerano questi giocatori tra cui lucarelli e ho detto va benissimo
1149738 ormai domizzi saltato da tempo i nomi erano quelli domizzi lucarelli aronica noi abbiamo preso giocatori che avevano piacere a venire da noi gli altri avevano delle esigenze diverse da quello che noi vogliamo da un giocatore prima la voglia di venire a parma poi laspetto economico
1149739 in questo momento il presidente sa benissimo che siamo quasi al completo quindi ne andr via uno e ne arriver un altro parravicini un giocatore che vuole andare via da tempo la richiesta stata fatta dalla reggina e la reggina ha detto che avrebbe dato vigiani a me stava bene il giocatore per le societ non si sono messe daccordo perch giustamente la reggina vuole fare uno scambio alla pari che non ha una logica perch parravicini ha 25 anni e vigiani 31
1149740 quella di cigarini stata una sua richiesta fin dallinizio quando sono arrivato a parma mi stato detto che cigarini sarebbe stato dato in compropriet per una scelta del giocatore e poi il giocatore aveva mercato e quando mi stato detto io per ho richiesto budel e me lhanno preso lho chiesto perch lavevo avuto lanno prima questo giocatore andava via e quindi ritenevo giusto sostituirlo con un giocatore che secondo me ha caratteristiche simili con esperienza
1149741 ho fatto questo e basta perch poi la squadra era fatta quando ho parlato con il presidente mi stato detto che rimanevano un certo numero di giocatori erano tutti quelli dellanno scorso a parte cigarini per dessena discorso diverso e capitata questa occasione sia per la societ sia per il giocatore e ho pensato che forse giocava in ruolo in cui era meglio maturasse maggiormente in serie a e quindi stata fatta questa scelta
1149742 per quanto riguarda le qualit tecniche penso di s adesso vediamo quello che faranno questanno se non sar questanno saranno i prossimi sicuramente sono ragazzi di 20 anni
1149743 dipende da quello che faranno questanno comunque lidea questa sono rimasti in compropriet appunto per questo motivo intanto dobbiamo andare in serie a
1149744 non c pi nessuno che va via marco rossi e paolo castellini rimarranno sicuramente a parma questanno io spero anche in futuro perch sono due ottimi giocatori lunico che muoviamo parravicini poi vediamo uno vuole andare ma deve avere anche la squadra quindi essendo un giocatore di qualit non sarebbe un problema se dovesse rimanere
1149745 parlare di queste cose difficilissimo la societ gli aveva detto che come portiere aveva fatto una scelta diversa io anche e quindi ero daccordo con la societ di fare questo cambiamento la societ gli ha detto di rimanere nei quadri lui ci ha pensato e ha detto che vuole continuare a giocare addirittura in serie a speriamo che abbia questa fortuna
1149746 e difficile fare una valutazione tutti ci danno come favoriti poi alla fine vedremo noi lotteremo per andare in serie a sicuramente a lottare con noi ci saranno anche empoli e livorno vedo bene mantova e brescia e poi i sono le out sider che verranno fuori
1149747 i campionati italiani sono imprevedibili ci sono delle situazioni che sono abbastanza prevedibili ma come ho detto prima ci sono le out sider adesso quali siano non lo so
1149748 lempoli ha una squadra forte che con la partenza di pratali dovr sistemarsi meglio comunque vitale un buon direttore sa il fatto suo conosce questa categoria sa come si vince e da qui al 1 settembre la squadra la fa sicuro

1149751 we believe this decline was primarily driven by aneconomic slowdown which caused physicians to delay theirdecision to make capital equipment purchases
1149752 we cannot tolerate bigotry racism ethnicism or whateverit is but the jurors in the case that stood up against jurorno 8 did the right thing and i am convinced that the verdictthat was reached was the verdict of only those jurors
1149753 if only every jury in this country would react to racismthe way this jury did we would have a better judicial system
1149754 a referendum is a useful tool when the issue involved is straightforward and lends itself to a simple yes no answer however a cpz is not a straightforward matter
1149755 the results of the first consultation showed a clear majority of residents in the high kingsdown and lower kingsdown areas want a cpz
1149756 in these areas that were so positive about the tangible benefits this will bring to their lives the next stage is to work with people to refine the scheme so it is sensitive to local circumstances
1149757 where there was a clear majority against as we promised we have listened and acted t hose proposals have been dropped
1149758 i dont think there is anyone that doesnt accept that something needs to be done about the parking problems in kingsdown
1149759 if we were to carry on until we had 100 per cent support we would have to wait a very long time in the meantime the parking problems would continue
1149760 if we were to stop at this stage it would just lead to a great deal more uncertainty
1149761 if people are parking and causing an obstruction that is an offence and they do not need any more rules to deal with that i see the introduction of a cpz as an entirely separate issue it is not the right way to deal with the problem
1149762 nothing you do ever goes away and nothing you do ever escapes notice there isnt any privacy get over it
1149763 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway even unto the end fo the world amen
1149764 and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted
1149765 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world amen
1149766 i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish

1149772 by calling for change in tehran based on iranians instead of americans ipc stresses the potential for a third alternative keep open diplomatic and military options while providing a central role for the iranian opposition to facilitate regime change
1149773 i think that regime change ought to be the policy of the bush administration but regime change doesnt mean that you need the 4th infantry division to come in from the north and meet up in the south with the 3rd infantry division coming in from the south and the marines coming in from the west that is iran is not iraq
1149774 continuing strength in international markets coupled with healthy demand in the u s helped drive higher worldwide sales of semiconductors in june
1149775 key demand drivers for semiconductors especially personal computers which account for 40 percent of semiconductor sales and mobile phones which drive about 20 percent of demand continued to show double digit unit growth
1149776 emerging markets are a major factor in driving worldwide semiconductor sales
1149777 pc unit sales in emerging markets are expected to grow by 19 percent more than double the growth rate in developed markets this year in 2008 developing countries with sales of over 153 million units will account for half of worldwide pc sales in mobile phones developing countries are expected to account for 66 percent of total worldwide unit sales of over 1 3 billion up from 61 percent last year the emergence of large middle class populations in china india eastern europe and latin america has more than offset the effects of slower growth in the u s economy we expect that demand for consumer electronic products in these new markets will continue to outpace growth in developed markets for the next several years
1149778 inventory for the industry is in balance with minor excess in a few product sectors
1149779 advances in semiconductor technology continue to deliver huge benefits to consumers as semiconductor devices deliver higher performance and increased functionality at lower cost
1149780 at the same time rapid price declines for microchips tend to mask the real growth of the industry the cost of 1 gigabit of dram has declined by 43 percent during the past year while the price of 2 gigabits of nand flash has declined by 61 percent in the last 12 months lower prices enable increased memory content in consumer devices micron estimates that the memory content of the average pc will increase at least 50 percent this year while the memory content in the average cell phone will increase by more than 150 percent
1149781 the impact of advanced technology on energy efficiency is even more dramatic

1149832 you will get a bigger discount if you buy a large variety of items the trick is to come early as the freshest produce is snapped up in the early hours of the morning

1149840 i am going to turn 65 soon but i am still strong and active the fact is that i do listen to my members
1149841 i can choose not to contest this year but that will only create infighting and factions over the top two posts
1149842 god willing i will leave my post in mid 2009 for the sake of unity in wanita and the party please accept this succession plan i am offering
1149843 and to the sceptics let me tell you i am someone who keeps her word
1149844 perhaps they should look at themselves first before asking me to do that
1149845 the youth and puteri are known as wings of the party but let me declare here that wanita has always been the backbone the strength of the party
1149846 when i took over for the second time the movement was in a mess and disunited it took us years to heal the wounds

1149848 i realised that all this time my family had been eating meals that were less nutritious i did not put much thought into this as i did not know the importance of choosing the right type of food
1149849 we are not rich we have to work hard to get enough money to survive but i didnt know that food is also important for our health
1149850 hearing about how the other mothers make their choice made me realise that we all want our families to be healthy
1149851 they like to eat simple quick to make dishes like white rice with fried eggs sprinkled with sweet soy sauce and instant noodles
1149852 they prefer chicken to fish and they like fried items the boys dont like vegetables my husband and i love fresh vegetables which we eat raw with sambal
1149853 this is one of the steps by the pakatan rakyat state government to alleviate the financial burden of low income groups affected by rising living costs

1149866 people started asking me all sorts of questions if i was involved in the bribery case but the fact is i was there to help in investigations together with 11 other players
1149867 the reason for this suit is to show and prove to the public that i am innocent clean and do not accept bribes i would like to clear my name as it has been tarnished
1149868 some of us feel that our voice is not heard at the divisional and national level this is not what we want as puteri umno should play an active role in mainstream politics
1149869 azalina was a very vocal leader and during her tenure puteri was flying high however noraini prefers to play it safe this could well be a reason why some quarters are not taking our presence seriously
1149870 it is only those who are outside the movement who feel that puteri umno is quiet noraini has empowered the divisional and state puteri chiefs to organise their own programmes and we are conducting many activities on the ground
1149871 the problem with puteri umno is most of us are not known outside and it is rather difficult to get publicity that is why the perception that puteri umno is lying low arises
1149872 we have been quiet thus you cannot feel upset if people say that we are less relevant to todays political situation
1149873 it is partly our fault the whole movement has to be reinvented from top to bottom
1149874 in the 2004 election when i wanted to contest the deputy head post i was told to concentrate on my constituency so the same approach must be used now

1149888 pero a causa de las fornicaciones cada uno tenga su propia mujer y cada una tenga su propio marido
1149889 que cada uno sepa tener o adquirir su propia esposa en santificaci n y honor y no en pasi n de concupiscencia pasi n sexual descontrolada como los gentiles que no conocen a dios
1149890 pues dios nos ha llamado a santidad y no a inmundicia
1149891 pero jehov estaba con jos y fue var n pr spero y estaba en la casa de su amo el egipcio

1149894 luego la aborreci con gran aborrecimiento que el odio con que la aborreci fue mayor que el
1149895 y manifiestas son las obras de la carne que son adulterio fornicaci n inmundicia lascivia
1149896 y no se arrepintieron de sus homicidios ni de sus hechicer as ni de su fornicaci n ni de sus hurtos

1149907 figure out whether existing tax laws governing churches are adequate which could carry sweeping implications for all religious organizations
1149908 see we are on the up and up and the idea that a christian ministry would do something that doesnt comply with the law is both unfair and unchristian
1149909 genuinely reflect our common love for god and for one another
1149910 christians and muslims have had periods of good and bad relationships
1149911 its true the world has all kinds of problems but hes working on the symptoms and avoiding the root cause which is the sin nature of humanity so how can you work with all kinds of people who are called people of faith but its not biblical faith

1149967 most of us at circuit city share a rich sense of humor and irony but there are occasional temporary lapses we apologize for the knee jerk reaction and have issued a retraction order the affected stores are being directed to put the magazines back on sale

1149980 we just have to win both series and take whats coming
1149981 hes such a good pitcher sometimes he can use a teams aggressiveness against them
1149982 florida has a very aggressive team they hit a lot of home runs jamies style matches up good against them hes such a master of what hes doing he can see what theyre swinging at and move it a couple of inches
1149983 i dont have an answer theyre all good hitters they give you good at bats they battle its a matter of making pitches
1149984 on monday well fly up to philly and deal with jamie moyer try to figure out that one first
1149985 you get bored with the same thing but thats just part of it it was fun a lot more productive than i thought it was going to be i thought peoples tempers would be flying but it really wasnt it was good it was a good practice i got a lot out of it
1149986 i think it seemed like the defense got the best ends on both sides of the field which would be normal situation with guys coming in and not knowing what the other side is going to do exactly and what theyve been doing all offseason
1149987 it was just that when i hit him it kind of lifted him up i guess it was kind of too hard for him i didnt really hit him that hard but he got kind of upset
1149988 if things are important to you you will fight about it
1149989 we had a couple of those it was nothing that took away from our ability to work
