3800006 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
3800007 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
3800008 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
3800009 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid
3800010 rally the free world at the defense of a free georgia

3800012 a u s c 17 aircraft with humanitarian supplies is on its way
3800013 and in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
3800014 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3800015 for someone with a track record flair commitment and a sound business brain we can remove the hurdles that most people face when they start their business
3800016 with the quality of the location and the right person behind the project this has the potential to become one of birminghams best loved restaurants
3800017 the custard factorys location isnt great the venue has struggled over the years and from a business point of view whoever takes on a restaurant there will risk a lot
3800018 birmingham now has a sophisticated dining offer and while any new addition will always be welcome im not sure a restaurant at this venue would work
3800019 i opened jessicas in the wrong end of town and it became one of the first restaurants in birmingham to gain a michelin star
3800020 if the right operator goes in there and launches something with an edge that really works in the space theres no reason why it shouldnt become massively successful
3800021 ive got to accept that endsleigh is no more at least we handed it over in a much better state than we got it
3800022 i cant pretend it was anything other than a huge wrench when mum decided to get rid of it we did something very special there
3800023 i dont know if there is any other vehicle or any other technology that has generated this kind of interest because of the state of the market and gas prices
3800024 frankly i think thats disgusting honestly theyre 7 and 9 years old so young
3800025 so forget beijing 2008 best opening ceremony so far is still sydney 2000 they didnt see it necessary to use computer generated images to impress the world
3800026 something about passing over a child for crooked teeth just seems well wrong
3800027 china wants the olympics as a stage to present a picture perfect image to the outside world and perfection was clearly the goal for the dazzling opening ceremonies
3800028 eager to put on a perfect olympics beijing has swept its streets of fake designer handbags pirated dvds and phony corporate logos that dedication to authenticity apparently does not extend to olympics ceremonies
3800029 11 jack perhaps you and any others who felt this was alarmist would have reacted different
3800030 so a band that encouraged people to bootleg their tunes doesnt allow people to quote their words

3800035 i mean what we kind of had is an either or scenario weve either had all oil there seems to be this paradigm that everyone thinks exists where its all gotta be oil related petroleum based products or its gotta be all renewables and thats just not a reasonable plan neither of those plans actually get us to where we want to go

3800042 its an honor for me to follow in the footsteps of so many outstanding educators who have led dedman college
3800043 the ingenuity and leadership of my predecessors going back to the universitys founding combined with the indispensable contributions of the faculty have built the solid foundation that the world knows as smu my goal is to build upon the spirit of innovation that lies within the very core of dedman
3800044 cordelia candelaria has the experience and vision to provide the leadership needed to meet our aspirations
3800045 from smus opening in 1915 the humanities and sciences have been the centerpiece of the university as we approach our centennial with a new major gifts campaign we are committed to raising resources in particular for enhancements to dedman college
3800046 conspiracy to use as well as to buy and sell fraudulent diplomatic identification cards
3800047 as robots enter our everyday life they need to have sensors everywhere on their bodies like humans
3800048 imagine they bump into babies robots need to feel temperatures heat and pressure like we do to co exist otherwise it would be dangerous
3800049 the country does not want to go ahead with that kind of research
3800050 the research performed by the csiro team was of high scientific quality but the long term feasibility of the gm approach on cane toads was found to be questionable
3800051 this was because the scientists had difficulty in generating the immune response they had hoped for and not yet determined the right virus to carry the genetic modification
3800052 there was also the major hurdle of obtaining approval for release of such a virus even if the team was able to achieve their desired result
3800053 i understand we have to be very careful with releasing genetically engineered viruses into nature because it could have a detrimental effect upon our native frogs
3800054 that campaign will or will not show the communitys attitudes to cane toads and im very sure it will have a very very big turn out
3800055 but that by itself is not going to address the problem of cane toads because people are people its a day out and they need to keep doing that for a long time
3800056 we were called to a man who received an electric shock and fell from the roof
3800057 on arrival we found a male person on the ground who was conscious after receiving an electric shock by trying to remove the gazebo from the roof
3800058 he was trying to untangle it and got an electric shock and fell to the paved area
3800059 i know the government has spoken in the past about basing regional offices in the commercial centres and that is townsville cbd
3800060 i think having ergon in the cbd would send a clear strong message to government and private enterprise about the exciting times which lay ahead for the townsville cbd district
3800061 well put our case forward very strongly that the right decision for them is to be in an energy efficient building in the cbd
3800062 it would be akin to putting the staff of the townsville bulletin in the social isolation of the bohle industrial plains
3800063 if people working at ergon can intermingle with the genteel population of the cbd its a lot more healthy
3800064 we dont have to drive anywhere unless we want to or want kentucky fried chicken
3800065 its not difficult to write a full length commercial novel in one month if you do the hard work up front i know thats what i do
3800066 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3800067 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3800068 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3800069 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3800070 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3800071 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems

3800090 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the
3800091 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
3800092 it was supposed to be a picture that inspired the olympic spirit
3800093 the simple question is would stern and the league hold the american players accountable and i think the answer to that is yes
3800094 so why wouldnt he hold the other nba players accountable unless the rules only apply to the american players
3800095 we could say that too but at the end of day we are still representing the nba
3800096 no matter if were saying the actions have nothing to do with it at the end of day we have to go back home and our jobs are there
3800097 it would start an international riot if we did it but they arent us
3800098 its low rent stuff but fiba wont do squat so the nba would show them up with any punitive action i would be shocked if the nba does any more than condemn the action
3800099 if you being a jew live like the gentiles and not like the jews how is it that you compel the gentiles to live like jews
3800100 you have some there who hold the teaching of balaam
3800101 who taught balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of israel that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice immorality
3800102 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3800103 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3800104 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3800105 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3800106 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3800107 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3800108 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3800109 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3800110 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3800111 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3800112 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3800113 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
3800114 but the lord is the true god he is the living god and the everlasting king at his wrath the earth will tremble and the nations will not be able to endure his indignation

3800119 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3800120 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how anyone else see the video of mccain at a kkk klan meeting in arizona i hear it shows him in full klan leader robes with hood in hand
3800121 would consider a proposal that recognizes the value of the company and reflects the significant benefits that would accrue to roche as a result of full ownership

3800123 when youre making 16 000 a year like a junior enlisted person 100 is a chunk of change
3800124 analysis while mccain is posturing for political gain his blustering rhetoric make dangerous foreign policy better to keep it cool and measured than boyish machismo final analysis mccain is not good at foreign policy as usually portrayed
3800125 wonder if french president nicolas sarkozy has any ideas about iraq conservative french president likes obama not all conservatives are idiots just the american brand
3800126 like pres bush sen mccain seems to think that talking tough and making idle threats is good politics the us cannot lead an allied effort to apply political or economic pressure because we have neglected and even sabotaged our alliances
3800127 now we have mccain grandstanding he scares me folks if he had been president right now we would be fighting a war with russia
3800128 why did you omit from the story the highly relevant fact that randy scheunemann mccains adviser has been a paid lobbyist for the georgian government and his firm still has a contract with them do we really need a president who gets his foreign policy advice from people who are working for foreign governments
3800129 this is a genuinely bad article how can it not report that the adviser who praises mccains knowledge is georgias lobbyist we do not need simultaneous crusades against iraq iran and russia all the more so when as pearlstein says russia controls the oil and gas
3800130 the post is showing itself to be a true hack paper
3800131 page 3 this is front page screaming headline stuff the guy wants to be president of the united states and he is taking advice from somebody on another countrys payroll front page thats gotta be front page
3800132 maybe we should let barry make a decision he would tell putin to just take over any country he wants barry does not want to fight as hes too much of a wimp
3800133 mccain clearly demonstrates his knowledge of the region and the players while obama recreates his version of neville chamberlain the difference could not be clearer
3800134 in regards to russian aggression john mccain is talking loud and saying nothing these conservatives and neocons reminds me of a barking dog chasing a car the gist of the matter is his loud irritating bark which avail est nothing
3800135 its dumbfounding that mccains reaction to the georgia fighting is cheered by some as proof of his sound foreign policy credentials i am surprised that some americans would still cheer a warmonger and want him to be president
3800136 mccain is an idiot does he realize that georgia actually started this mess sure russia has overreacted but georgia attacked the pro russian province of ossetia first dolt
3800137 it is mccains service in the senate which makes him a better candidate that obama whose resume is so thin it practically disappears the world remains dangerous especially with too many ambitious men who seek to control it kumbya and hand holding will not change that
3800138 be nice to the messiah obama dont be critical of his inexperience dont be critical of his loony wife dont be critical of his america hating preachers dont be critical of his saying nothing more than platitudes about hope and change and if you do have the audacity to be critical we have a solution for you we call you a racist
3800139 i wonder who mccain is going to get to fight his war with russia maybe he is thinking that if we stand up pound our chests and yell usa usa they will just turn and run away
3800140 im not particularly fond of obama but there is no way im voting for this baffoon mccain the last thing this country needs is a president who feels the military is the first in only option in settling international conflicts
3800141 ask yourselves are the russians any less advanced or civilized than americans and yet its ok for them to roll into georgia unprovoked killing and seizing up personal property and real estate furthermore its sounding like they dont plan to stop there
3800142 hay lets go shoot some ruskies and hope nukes dont get involved
3800143 is russia trying to destroy the west or is russia just putting a show of force on for its neighbors
3800144 is it possible that mccain or someone from his campaign gave a
3800145 mccains adviser has been a paid lobbyist for the georgian government and his firm still has a contract with them do we really need a president who gets his foreign policy advice from people who are working for foreign governments
3800146 iraq is the convergence point for two of the greatest threats to america in this new century al qaeda and iran
3800147 the things he can control on inventory he really has done a terrific job
3800148 its going to be difficult for them and everybody else
3800149 the difficult macroeconomic environment causes us to be cautious in our outlook as we proceed through the second half of the year
3800150 we however note apple products typically carry low margins and strong initial sales could negatively impact best buys gross margin
3800151 obama has virtually dropped out of sight retreating to hawaii leaving it to mccain to boost his celebrity status at the same time obamas absence might have given mccain the field to himself maybe to pick up some ground command the stage for a bit before the conventions
3800152 but it wasnt to be first came olympic swimmer michael phelps and the redeem team then came the wonderful lying john edwards and the love child then bushs pal and soul mate former kgb thug vladimir putin decided to go for a little revenge on bush and nato by smacking around the upstart and powerless georgians
3800153 its really a validation of where weve been able to take our wireless operations
3800154 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months

3800163 thousands of other republicans are going to be picking country over party in this election
3800164 my goal is to let republicans have a clear understanding that their right to vote should not be restricted by party affiliation
3800165 one candidate john mccain who has always put country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not

3800167 significant parts of the book whose subtitle is leftist politics and the cult of personality have already been challenged as misleading or false in the days since its debut on aug 1 nonetheless it is to make its first appearance on the new york times best seller list for nonfiction hardcovers this sunday at no 1 the book is being pushed along by a large volume of bulk sales intense voter interest in mr obama and a broad marketing campaign that has already included 100 author interviews with talk radio hosts across the country like sean hannity and g gordon liddy mr corsi said on tuesday

3800172 forget blogs the bookworld may still be the best place to push false truths about someone
3800173 in the book world there is no fact checking a la the msm and the credibility a hardcover gives to a charge is something the msm at least fox news ends up covering

3800176 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
3800177 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
3800178 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
3800179 poti is one of the most important ports in the black sea
3800180 the offensive means that the ceasefire is dead back to ground zero
3800181 right in front me no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
3800182 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
3800183 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
3800184 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of this ceasefire they pledged not to move from their positions and stop firing
3800185 what this adds up to however while we may have have a ceasefire on the ground this is an extraordinary show of russian force
3800186 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
3800187 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
3800188 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3800189 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3800190 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
3800191 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
3800192 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3800193 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
3800194 balkan type and world war ii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
3800195 we are getting reports of large scale violation of human rights of the worst of the case
3800196 the town of tskhinvali was turned into grozny two by russian carpet bombardment and i really want people to go in and check and verify what kind of bombs are these
3800197 this is august 7 this is my birthday and im taking a bath in the sink at burger king
3800198 any bacteria on his skin could have been deposited giving people food poisoning
3800199 we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident
3800200 we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video
3800201 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3800202 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3800203 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3800204 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3800205 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3800206 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3800207 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her
3800208 how many people can you find who have a good heart to help other people in this world
3800209 we could see there were people inside but there was nothing you could do it was horrible
3800210 one hundred feet in either direction and he could have hit some cars
3800211 i hope one day that things will be back to normal
3800212 i would love to be able to sit up and watch television with him after the kids have gone to bed i guess i can keep hoping and praying
3800213 they were good neighbors and it was just a tragic loss
3800214 it was really a brand new plane if there were any problems it wouldnt have been cleared to fly
3800215 he was the kind of guy you could go to when you had a question about process or procedure
3800216 he was someone who worshipped the process and followed the rules he had opinions but he put the process above anything else
3800217 he was a guy who was public spirited and public minded
3800218 regardless of which side of the issue people were on they all respected joe
3800219 i think hes crashed his altitude went up down up down and then he disappeared off the radar at really low altitude
3800220 people rushed over and tried to help but it was just too late the flames were too intense
3800221 we ran outside we saw the flames and the smoke and we could just see the tail of the plane
3800222 there certainly was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and ive also felt it was a misplaced cockiness
3800223 youve got a lot of conditions that are similar to 1932 and similar to 1980 a very unpopular president and the party brand badly hurt
3800224 but we wont know if its going to happen until late
3800225 i dont think you see leads in presidential races over 5 points in this day and age hes averaged leads of 3 points since spring the key is that obama hasnt closed the sale
3800226 it wasnt until reagan reached the threshold that he was able to close the sale
3800227 there is something about obama that is causing something of drag
3800228 this may sound kind of harsh but if the democratic nominee were a white male from a red or purple state the theory would be dead on that this would be set up there would be a very very high probability for a democratic landslide
3800229 youve never had a young guy win by such a large margin post war
3800230 were here to help people take their location to the web by giving them the ability to control how much detail about their location they want to share and which applications they want to share it with
3800231 although the impact on their web sites is clear i believe this may end up being just some kids who got overexcited with georgia being ill prepared to say the least
3800232 while georgia is obviously under a ddos attacks and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online aftermath by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizers
3800233 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3800234 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers
3800235 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3800236 they were having some keypads issues what the judges push the other was a broadcasters decision it was not nbc the beijing broadcasters were showing the floor live as alicia was ready to compete on beam they couldnt change in the middle of a live event
3800237 the reasons seem logical even though we dont like them
3800238 it was not our decision to hold the competitor from competing
3800239 those are decisions that are made by the fig international gymnastics federation competition official the federations run the competition
3800240 they never should talk to the gymnast and they are obliged to do it right
3800241 we did so much training of making them tough and keeping their focus and concentration and still it happens it is disappointing
3800242 at this point the fig and the international olympic committee have closed the age issue
3800243 its fair to address but at this point the competition was what it was today china was a better team on the competition floor i think theres no making excuses
3800244 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that

3800249 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
3800250 this is much bigger than any other place where there is america influence and this is the most natural allies of america
3800251 who else can stand up for liberty in the world
3800252 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had one in georgia i would be very nervous
3800253 i thin those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today
3800254 it was a joint decision to achieve the most theatrical effects
3800255 i do not think there is anything wrong with that
3800256 the sensors available at that time were no good for space systems because they were big quite heavy and used a lot of heating power
3800257 so we had to develop a new type of miniaturized sensor to measure re entry conditions for spacecraft the sensors had to be very small and capable of measuring oxygen at high altitudes and during re entry
3800258 it is very easy to find terrestrial applications for this miniaturized gas sensor the sensor reacts very fast and this is useful in many cases where you need to measure ambient conditions on earth
3800259 one application where the sensor is particularly useful is measurement of the human breath with this sensor we can measure oxygen carbon dioxide and the flow of human breath and obtain the results immediately something which is impossible with the conventional systems
3800260 the sensor works well with combustible gasses and can be used to optimise the burners in industrial plants and home heating systems if you place the sensor in the exhaust gases you can control the heaters in real time by using a special algorithm and ensure that the burner operates at an optimum level
3800261 this system can reduce the exhaust gases that are harmful for the environment and at the same time by ensuring the heating system works at an optimum level it can also reduce fuel consumption by about 10 to 15
3800262 we will see more technology spinning back into space in the future

3800296 employers are increasingly viewing employee benefits programs as strategic differentiators because they can help employers address employee loyalty satisfaction and retention goals companies and brokers that are well informed about benefits trends across various industries geographies and demographics and how theirs or their clients benefits programs compare are better positioned to develop competitive and effective programs that attain their business objectives
3800297 with the diversity of employee populations and their respective employers a one size fits all benefits program can be ineffective and inefficient for addressing employers top two benefits objectives employee retention and cost control by increasing the level of customization the benefits benchmarking tool can provide metlife makes it easier for employers and brokers to identify benefits solutions for their unique needs

3800308 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
3800309 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
3800310 any instance of gods guidance of history or any alternative to evolution
3800311 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
3800312 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
3800313 we evaluate the courses to see whether they prepare these kids to come to college at uc
3800314 there was no evidence that these students were in fact denied the ability to come to the university
3800315 if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
3800316 we now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120 percent

3800336 any time we see a tanker truck we always assume its loaded until proven otherwise thank god this was empty at the time of the accident so that there wasnt an emergency if there had been another accident
3800337 we called in weavertown environmental group theyre going to do the clean up the driver actually put down some pads and some absorbent pigs to contain the spill he was actually using the pads wringing up the product and using the tub right there so he did some pretty important work before we got here so he tried to contain the spill as best he could

3800339 in any game to score and win 1 0 is a boost especially for the forward
3800340 i thought we created a lot of chances and although they put a lot of pressure on us i thought we could have won by more
3800341 the first 20 minutes i thought they looked decent and had a few chances and i thought we probably paid them a little too much respect initially
3800342 we have some high profile owners and have the tag of favourites to go up but we have to embrace that and meet it head on
3800343 the agreement gives ener1 sole ownership of crucial assets at an important time in this rapidly growing industry
3800344 it gives us more freedom and greater opportunity to bring innovations to market faster and at lower cost
3800345 the transition also paves the way for new strategic partnerships something we have long said is a key competitive objective
3800346 its funny how things can turn around he struggled to settle for a long time but hes matured a lot
3800347 he was terrific he dropped off and played in between the defence and midfield and showed that he can be the man to get the goals for us
3800348 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year i just dont have a choice

3800351 its moving forward now and we hope to bring it to a conclusion later today
3800352 in all honesty i think we should have been pleased to see it go to penalties but they got the goal that they deserved
3800353 weve got to give them some credit because they deserved the victory and we go away with our tail between our legs
3800354 it was a great honour to be asked to be part of such a successful culture as leicester tigers

3800368 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
3800369 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking left 4 dead on the road
3800370 when the policeman had me on the ground i was looking right at him and i didnt see anyone touch him
3800371 they didnt tell me anything they charged me with assault but those are the only charges against me
3800372 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration
3800373 the administrations attempt to challenge mr suskinds reporting appears to have been effectively dismissed by the publication of the authors interview recordings and transcripts i have instructed my staff to conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter
3800374 we feel the star is paying the price for johnston presss greedy spending spree over the last few years and bad decisions taken by senior management
3800375 the company relies on the goodwill loyalty and dedication of its staff who earn meagre salaries well below the national average wage
3800376 our staff have put in many dedicated years of service around the clock and this is how they are repaid
3800377 we believe the way to sell more newspapers is to invest in editorial content rather than employ a skeleton staff and we will fight these cuts
3800378 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood

3800380 if its the cancer sure get whatever you want but you know it isnt the cancer you are just making a big deal out of nothing
3800381 we know a lot of publishers are doing nothing with their international eyeballs or are using one ad network
3800382 our proposition is based around the better monetisation of 1000 ads currently for many publishers that can be less than 1 0 52 we promise face to face to improve that maybe by 10 times 20 times or even 50 times
3800383 we are there to help the transition from print to digital
3800384 publishers cant just expect digital to be the white knight that will come along and save them and some of the publishers we are speaking to do expect that publishers need to understand digital better they need to understand what digital advertisers need and invest heavily in their digital output they are well on the road but by their own admission they are by no means there
3800385 theres a great pc world down the road to help when the blackberry breaks and what else would i need
3800386 finding and adding the value no matter what side of the negotiating table he is on
3800387 well what am i going to do trust some 22 year old yahoo sales rep who will dump adverts in indiscriminately or a man like chris who is going to rock up and represent the telegraph a brand that oozes trust and respectability
3800388 this is new and there will be bumps i dont expect it to be all puppy dogs and ice cream but with chris i can have a grown up value based discussion
3800389 believes that uk historical ad spending rises cannot be sustained as advertisers pull away from decaying circulation which has fallen by 33 in the past 20 years compared with a 19 fall in the us
3800390 cautioned that uk newspaper stocks which have fallen by 40 since the start of the year compared with us papers down by 48 could fall farther
3800391 every media company will be affected in the downturn some are structurally doomed to be blunt others are cyclically challenged
3800392 to survive media companies have to make no acquisitions pay great care and attention to their core products and ensure they have solid banking relationships then they have to take a realistic rather than an overly optimistic view of just how long this is going to last
3800393 regretfully the proposals put at risk of redundancy up to 30 posts in these areas and we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3800394 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3800395 armonizar el crecimiento econ mico con la estabilidad de precios no implica reducir la tasa de crecimiento econ mico sino estabilizar la tasa de crecimiento econ mico sobre un sendero de crecimiento equilibrado
3800396 were doing quite a lot on it from a news perspective in the paper and also on our website
3800397 weve been carrying extensive coverage since monday and treating it as a major story
3800398 weve had medallists in european competitions but i dont know of any olympic ones
3800399 its the first games weve had so much close involvement with
3800400 theres a lot of interest in mansfield as its such an unusual thing for us
3800401 theres talk of giving her the freedom of the district and therell be quite a lot of celebrating when she comes back
3800402 the printing press in upper mounts in northampton is used by 39 other johnston press titles printing more than one million copies a week
3800403 following a detailed review of the printing press operations within johnston press it is proposed to close the printing operation in northampton and to reduce the printing operation in peterborough
3800404 in the event this proposal goes ahead the company will endeavour to minimise the impact of the proposal through voluntary redundancy and by re deployment to alternative positions within the company and the jp group
3800405 as well as enabling efficiency gains to be realised across the group these proposals also mark a significant strategic shift in our publishing strategy
3800406 the company remains totally committed to providing readers with highly relevant local content delivered in a range of print and digital formats when and where they want it and these proposals are consistent with this objective
3800407 we are very much opposed to it and the timing couldnt be worse
3800408 all media are in full steep ad slowdown and at the same time media companies are diversifying online
3800409 surging revenues and audiences online are what local media companies are about its not just a bolt on its intrinsic to business
3800410 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3800411 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3800412 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3800413 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3800414 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3800415 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3800416 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers
3800417 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work

3800442 i wonder what georgian president mikhael saakashvili was thinking on thursday evening when he ordered his army to topple the separatist government in south ossetia and to become the ruler of the country what i heard is that saakashvili doesnt recall that he gave the first order and he denies everything as all other people who are deeply disappointed for the same reason russia planned it to coincide with the opening ceremony of the summer olympic games but he is the one deciding the timing if the georgian troops had not entered south ossetia there couldnt have been any excuses for the bombardments on gori and tbilski let alone ossetia by the russian soldiers

3800463 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim

3800465 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
3800466 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
3800467 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
3800468 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
3800469 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
3800470 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country

3800472 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
3800473 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
3800474 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
3800475 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
3800476 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
3800477 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

3800482 im in my 60s and live in a place where its quite dry most of the time and ive had a lot of trouble for years with dry skin on my hands finger tips and thumb tips cracking open lots of roughness on the sides of some of the digits generalized coarseness and roughness i encountered shielding lotion in a store that sells high end hand woven garments yarn and knitting and weaving supplies
3800483 ive been using it throughout the day for about a week now not longer
3800484 the lotion sinks in very quickly and completely and there is no residual greasiness when i wet my hands there is none of the greasy feeling that other products have had there is no perfume in the lotion and therefore no odor on the hands im using it every four hours during the day i could not recommend this stuff more highly im totally satisfied even amazed my hands appear to have regressed in age by several decades id give this stuff ten stars if i could

3800489 a pinch is a device which creates like a cardiac arrest for any broadband electrical circuitry better yet a pinch is a bomb now but without the bomb see when a nuclear weapon detonates it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its blast radius now that tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon usually destroys anything you might need power for anyway but see a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse but without the fuss of mass destruction and death so instead of hiroshima youd be getting the seventeenth century

3800498 maintenance work will be carried out on the burke developmental road and other key state controlled roads in the gulf region
3800499 they are also heavily used by the grazing industry for stock transportation as well as tourists travelling the popular gulf tourist circuit
3800500 this maintenance work which includes road surface grading and culvert repairs will improve safety and efficiency for transporters and motorists travelling on these key regional links
3800501 in addition to roadworks the contract provides for repairs to sign posts and the installation of new guide posts both of which will improve safety for motorists
3800502 installing guide posts particularly along curved sections of road is an important safety measure to improve night visibility
3800503 i am delighted to be able to attend this seminar and look forward to meeting and helping these women who are determined to help change their communities
3800504 these free seminars will enable women to meet and network with leaders in their community and develop the skills and confidence they need to move into leadership roles
3800505 with highly regarded indigenous women speaking at the events women and girls can learn from their leadership experiences first hand
3800506 through a forum approach the women will share information training and ideas to help them to lead more effectively or become leaders in their community
3800507 many indigenous women already play a vital role in guiding the younger generations
3800508 by sharing their experiences these positive and enlightening speakers will spread their resourcefulness strength and initiative
3800509 their stories and resilience are a source of inspiration to all especially for younger women and girls wanting to develop their leadership skills
3800510 women these days are defying old occupational stereotypes breaking through the glass ceiling taking control of their finances and leading the community
3800511 these seminars will be a place to celebrate their achievements and speak to or mentor other women in their community giving stronger voices to strong women

3800513 we have made it through several floods following mitigation measures without any major flood related damages
3800514 we traveled here on weekends to get away from peoria and its traffic
3800515 a guy brought me here to go duck hunting once and thats all it took even though karen and i knew the towns flood history we liked it so much that we moved here permanently we also knew that we had to be prepared
3800516 when we built in 1995 i got the base flood elevation bfe for the area from a local official
3800517 we stayed through all of the high water events except the one in june 2008 we didnt have any gas
3800518 the illinois commerce commission passed a law which required the gas to be shut off during flooding events
3800519 once you get prepared for it its no big thing if you are going to live here you need to prepare
3800520 we have residents who are tearing down their homes and planning to move out of the area rather than face another flood
3800521 peoples day at the ekka is always a great day out for queensland families and the chance to meet your favourite sporting personalities will make this years event one to remember
3800522 fans will be able to chat to their sporting heroes about easy ways to find 30 minutes of physical activity a day and learn about the benefits of a healthy and active lifestyle
3800523 visitors can take on their families and friends in the 8 metre high rock wall challenge to see who can climb to the top in the shortest time with free prizes for every climber
3800524 there is also a mini obstacle course for those people who like to keep their feet on the ground
3800525 we want to get the message to queenslanders that by making small changes in their daily lives they can achieve the recommended 30 minutes of exercise each day
3800526 the find your 30 campaign is a queensland government initiative which encourages all queenslanders to adopt a healthier and more active lifestyle
3800527 the reality is less than 50 of the queensland adult population is sufficiently active to receive health benefits and two out of three males and one in two females are overweight
3800528 even more concerning is the fact that in the first year of school in queensland 17 of boys and 20 of girls are already overweight for many of these children this means they will then become obese adults
3800529 for people of all ages simple activities like brisk walking swimming dancing and cycling can help reduce the risk of a range of diseases
3800530 i urge everyone to visit the department of sport and recreation display at the ekka to learn from our states sporting champions how easy it is to find your 30 each day and take positive steps towards a happier healthier lifestyle
3800531 every year flooding causes billions of dollars in property damage in the united states
3800532 yet thousands who experienced flooding had no flood insurance because they thought they would never need it
3800533 in less than a month the giants will begin their 2008 season as defending champions and what better way to kick things off then with a free concert in our recently rebuilt columbus circle
3800534 the nfl kickoff concert at times square in 2002 served as a great showcase of the citys vibrancy and the concert at columbus circle promises to be just as great a success
3800535 we are pleased to return to new york city to salute the super bowl champion new york giants and celebrate the start of the 2008 nfl season
3800536 we had a tremendous experience in 2002 in times square prior to the first season opener on a thursday night and look forward to working with mayor bloomberg and the city on another pregame music and football event
3800537 planning for the upgrade of this major arterial road was a complex task given the substantial traffic growth caused by rapid development in burpengary and caboolture
3800538 this upgrade will provide a safer more free flowing road environment for all road users including motorists pedestrians and cyclists
3800539 design work will focus on upgrading the existing two lane road to a four lane median divided road with provision for an upgrade to six lanes in the future
3800540 the local community provided valuable feedback throughout the planning process
3800541 this feedback together with extensive environmental traffic and engineering studies has given the project team some really solid key design features
3800542 we face two urgent challenges both of which were responding to as part of planyc
3800543 first we have to shrink our carbon footprint to slow climate change second we have to adapt to the environmental changes that are already beginning to take place for example raise critical infrastructure like back up generators to higher ground in areas prone to flooding changes in the way we maintain and operate our infrastructure can help secure our city
3800544 the rockefeller foundation is proud to help new yorkers blueprint and build a more sustainable future as a part of our 70 million commitment to strengthen community resilience to climate change
3800545 this new york city panel on climate change will shape innovative approaches to cope with global warmings potentially devastating consequences in our hometown and model the kind of planning which can and should be applied in cities around the world
3800546 experts at columbia universitys earth institute are pleased to offer scientific and technical expertise to assist the city of new york with its climate adaptation plans
3800547 it is our hope that cities in the united states and around the world will use new york citys planning process as a model to respond effectively to climate change challenges
3800548 we look forward to building on the important work the scientific community has already done on these issues and helping new york city find specific solutions to adapt to climate change
3800549 it is an honor to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the americans with disabilities act a tremendous milestone in the history of civil rights
3800550 our administration remains dedicated to ensuring greater accessibility for all new yorkers today we recognize some of the people and organizations who help people with disabilities fully participate in every aspect of city life and make new york the greatest city in the world for people with disabilities
3800551 today as we have done in the past the mayor and i are granting awards to recipients who share this administrations commitment to bettering the lives of people with disabilities
3800552 the recipients through their actions have demonstrated their dedication to the benefits provided by the americans with disabilities act

3800580 la noci n de criminalidad femenina pasa mayormente por el infanticidio el aborto o casos de homicidios pasionales y casi siempre se se ala que sucede porque la mujer sol a ser una v ctima que se convirti en victimaria es la visi n patriarcal que tenemos creemos que el crimen es cosa de hombres m s a n si es un delito sexual

3800588 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
3800589 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they already are the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
3800590 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
3800591 the elimination of new oil access roads could significantly reduce the impacts of most projects
3800592 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3800593 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent

3800604 the utes havent decided on their returners and those positions are up for grabs they need someone to replace derrek richards who led the conference in punt returns in 2007 averaging 14 7 yards and they need someone to do a better job on kickoff returns where the utes ranked last in the conference averaging only 19 5 yards a return
3800605 but its not just on the returners its on the guys up front too we have to be more productive
3800606 i can confirm that two of our patients absconded from the butler clinic at around 11pm last night

3800616 when a community is infested by drug dealers violence is not far away these kind of investigations are one of the things that we can do to help keep the streets safe

3800623 the european players have far greater opportunities they hone their skills in top leagues and face the best teams they gain lots of experience from that and its a huge help in developing their game
3800624 were travelling the length and breadth of china we started in hong kong then it was tianjin we were here today and now well be flying to shanghai i hope our tour ends in beijing
3800625 those guys are my boys and they played so hard for me they went into battle tonight and they have improved on the international stage in my heart the boys won the gold medal
3800626 this content is kind of terrible do we really have to release this
3800627 i think its a well made picture but while its funny in spots its very english
3800628 i dont think its broadly commercial it feels like a film that deserves a spirited release but not a wide one joel has an 800 screen deal which well honor but we might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to
3800629 the filmmakers have every right to do what they think is best in support of their movies but we have the right to do whats best for warner bros sometimes the pursuit of those interests results in a disagreement for now were preparing to release the film in october but i dont see it starting out on 800 screens if joel is thinking there is someone out there willing to spend twice as much money as were willing to im sure he will pursue that
3800630 id like for us to find a way to release movies like slumdog millionaire but we keep coming back to the same question can we really do it justice
3800631 throw this negative in joels moving truck on your way off the lot will you
3800632 in life i try to control the factors that i can and then do the best i can with all the rest
3800633 if you want lemon flavoring add a slice of lemon you want bubbles stick a straw in it and blow
3800634 hardly anyone had heard of bottled water being an issue back then
3800635 i had to do a lot of public education we chose houston as one of the original cities because it has really high quality tap water and it brings home the absurdity of people drinking bottled water
3800636 four billion plastic bottles end up in landfills each year
3800637 production of plastic water bottles produces more than two and a half million tons of carbon dioxide and requires the energy equivalent of 17 million barrels of oil per year
3800638 a family of three who rely exclusively on bottled water will by the time the first child is 18 have already spent on that water the equivalent of that childs college education in a public university
3800639 its just one of those fun popcorn movies i would love to bring back the fun popcorn movie extreme violence extreme absurdity but make it fun
3800640 you send him in a time machine and transport him to the old west there are gold rushes there are gunfights its awesome i have the whole thing already worked out
3800641 the rating affirmation is based on cvs caremarks track record in integrating acquired retail stores its strong cash flow generation and the expected debt reduction to restore credit measures to levels more appropriate for the rating
3800642 looking for improvement at mimis before becoming more constructive on the stock
3800643 while we are encouraged by managements progress in improving operations and processes systemwide we believe that the convergence of all the cost pressures previously mentioned will limit upside to shares of bob evans in the near term
3800644 gm has a pretty good track record in achieving its cost reduction targets and structuring transactions that help raise capital
3800645 its reasonable to expect that the plan being implemented now will help strengthen the companys liquidity position which otherwise could have become very strained by late 2009
3800646 interestingly they parked in front of a gate that had three different signs on it saying no hunting and or no firearms
3800647 we are very serious about enforcing this ban on hunting in sedgwick reserve
3800648 and people need to know that not only are we enforcing it during hunting season were there all year
3800649 we have solutions to these threats but political will is lacking for example the bush administration has been stalling for a year and a half a proposed rule that would slow ships down to protect north atlantic right whales during that time at least two endangered right whales have been struck
3800650 slowing ships down changing how we fish and cleaning up the oceans to make them safer for all ocean wildlife are necessary steps in protecting the future of our ocean if we dont start making changes now we will lose these and other ocean species forever which will alter essential ocean ecosystems that support human life
3800651 we are trying to determine how exactly so much lead got into those gold medals
3800652 until we do we are urging all first place athletes not to lick taste or suck on their medals
3800653 i am very very concerned about my extensive contact with gold medals
3800654 but what am i supposed to do stop being so awesome
3800655 she knew he would be well looked after here and she was able to let go of daned
3800656 you spend your entire adult life going to university and climbing the corporate ladder but all of a sudden you realize youre a mom
3800657 i thought i was a fairly intelligent person but when it came to parenting turns out i am not
3800658 i am raising a family of four just as my parents did and there are so many challenges
3800659 it is an exciting time as well as an overwhelming time and because i have had a lot of challenges with my kids i have one son with autism a daughter with an eating disorder other children with learning disabilities i think i really bring a real world perspective to parenting
3800660 sometimes when youre dealing with a colicky baby it seems youre never going to live through that stage
3800661 i am there to tell them that theyll get through that
3800662 when we discovered that we each had a passion about starting a dialogue with parents across the country it all began to come together
3800663 this is a rich format intended to give every parent attending a warm hug
3800664 im really not a chicken little player but i worry that no one seems to be focusing in on this
3800665 the level of excess capacity has shrunk down in the last few years to a level barely within the planning toleration of the industry
3800666 were to the point where we need every possible resource renewables demand response and energy efficiency nuclear clean coal you name it we need it
3800667 and we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers
3800668 if you dont have generation and transmission something has to give
3800669 the event was a major crisis and did probably force something to happen that would have otherwise not happened
3800670 its easy to take the power infrastructure for granted until something goes wrong
3800671 una vez con la cartera esperamos los dos en el sem foro a que pasara un coche de polic a cuando pas lo paramos y le dijimos lo que hab amos encontrado
3800672 this keeps building on the nets evolution processing peoples usage and behavior but to do that at a massive scale you have an intelligence system this is an area evolving in many different ways with a number of different companies and verticals
3800673 everyone talks about all the data thats being created and how valuable it is but the way you make it available is by doing something actionable with it
3800674 we are really fascinated with data and the ability to use it to increase effective cost per thousand for ads theres this explosion of inventory but people havent figured out how to monetize it yet data will be the difference
3800675 on the verge of exploding in the next two years
3800676 the iphone introduction has begun to cause a shakeup that is long overdue in mobileland
3800677 theres opportunity in the space between web apis and raw cloud computing
3800678 soon all youre going to need is a terminal and net connection but until then there are opportunities to build up file systems system admin services and other things we can do with web apis
3800679 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find that there are too many empty seats they organize some cheerleaders
3800680 exposing and combating the leftist media has never been such fun
3800681 this report has got nothing to do with the conservative party this is an independent think tank it has charitable status i think this report is complete rubbish it is barmy
3800682 it has produced some good work in the past but this is a very bad report sometimes they come up with good ideas and sometimes they come up with bad ideas this is a bad one
3800683 i think there is a resurgence going on in britains northern cities
3800684 it certainly wont become conservative party policy conservative party policy will continue the good work of regenerating cities right across england including northern cities
3800685 when i think of urban regeneration and city regeneration i think of things like the albert dock in liverpool the canal work in leeds the sage centre in gateshead
3800686 i think the idea that cities cant regenerate themselves they were built for one purpose and cant do another purpose is just nonsense
3800687 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3800688 cameron can distance himself from this all he wants but he needs to explain why his friends have no faith in the north
3800689 this is exactly the sort of vindictive anti northern thinking that led to the widespread industrial decline of swathes of the north under thatcher
3800690 apparently this is once again in vogue in notting hill
3800691 it is important to counter the claims in this report regeneration continues apace in the coastal northern town i represent which has new job opportunities new industry including a new planned shipping terminal and important increases in public spending
3800692 the reality of today is that the regeneration of cities and i can only speak for liverpool but its certainly improving by leaps and bounds
3800693 the people vs friar laurence the man who killed romeo and juliet
3800694 a scintillating jazz musical the amalgam of swinging jazz ditties comic numbers and torch songs results in a superb score brought to shimmering life
3800695 this is ridiculous theyre cheating i mean they faked the opening ceremony with cgi and a lip syncing cute girl how can i trust that theyre not cheating with their athletes
3800696 those fucking people have no ethics did you know they love whats going on in darfur despite the rantings of don cheadle and they eat dog whats wrong with them
3800697 im just glad that for two weeks im allowed to say goddamn chinese and have it be considered socially acceptable
3800698 their air is shit their government is shit their leaders are shit their chow mei fun is cool their humorous attempts at translating signs into english are kinda fun but everything else about them is shit they think theyre hot business because they have all the money and power
3800699 goddamn slant eye chinese fucks me ruv you rong time and shit god i love being a racist in public
3800700 this is ridiculous theyre cheating i mean they faked the evidence to invade iraq openly embraced milli vanilli and continue to watch sports where everyone is obviously taking horse steroids how can i trust that theyre not cheating with their athletes here
3800701 those fucking people have no ethics did you know they love whats going on in east saint louis despite the rantings of nelly and they eat snickers whats wrong with them
3800702 im just glad that for two weeks im allowed to say goddamn americans and not have my penis removed the secret police
3800703 their air is shit their government is shit their leaders are shit their big macs are cool their humorous attempts at getting chinese phrases tattooed on their arms are kinda fun but everything else about them is shit they think theyre hot business because they have all the money and power
3800704 today were calling on industry higher education and people from around the world to get involved and share their ideas and expertise as we collectively explore and design future directions for the web
3800705 unfortunately the trial court incorrectly held that trademark holders and not ebay are responsible for policing the ebay site the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders in our view this approach makes no sense as a matter of law or policy once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3800706 the 7 biggest loan mistakes real estate investors make and how to avoid them
3800707 i am convinced that the players who will arrive will be strong
3800708 however we only need to complete the roster i have trust in the players who i have
3800709 i can tell the fans that we will be at our best for the beginning of the season we are the same team we were last year with the added value of alberto aquilani who only played a little last season
3800710 we like him but we must respect the wage structure of the club when making purchases
3800711 i carefully remove the contents of my packets by slicing open the back along the bottom seam with a sharp blade i rinse the inside of the packets thoroughly to ensure all traces of sauce are expelled i then wait until the packets are completely dry before i place them in baseball card cases to preserve them cleanly and safely for many generations
3800712 wow bert favre is like a partial birth abortion out there on the football field
3800713 we here in new england understand what it takes to play championship football and brett favre doesnt play championship football
3800714 i wont mention anything about your cardio methods but we were able to obtain some exclusive footage from your most recent workout
3800715 the number looks disturbingly bullish but well probably see some rebound in gasoline supplies next week now that refineries are back online after the storm
3800716 weve got a good sized really going here today but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3800717 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3800718 particularly interested in engaging with designers who have not typically been involved with open source projects
3800719 to bring even more people to the table and provoke thought facilitate discussion and inspire future design directions for firefox the mozilla project and the web as a whole
3800720 i signed my new contract today so personally i am very happy i hope i made the fans happy too ive had seven great seasons this will be my eighth and i hope to have many more
3800721 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and this was one of them it does become frustrating when you see things written some untrue some slightly true we can now put it all to bed and focus on the football
3800722 this is a great day for the club for frank and for english football frank is committed and he agreed and signed a five year contract
3800723 this will kill all the speculation thats been going on for far too long 18 months not just this summer and it allows the club and frank to focus on whats important which is next season
3800724 obviously mine and my familys world got turned upside down it was very tough
3800725 now i feel for sure 100 ive made the right decision
3800726 ill always hold jos mourinho in very high regard but personally i hold chelsea football club in very high regard
3800727 a transfer i didnt speak to jos about it its something that shouldnt be done ive got a relationship with jose where weve had certain contacts afterwards which is normal
3800728 there are many players linked to our club but we will continue to work with calm
3800729 in particular i dont want to say anything about mauro esposito
3800730 what can we learn from the past and make the future better
3800731 has a head full of projects i hope he has time to complete because they all seem great to me
3800732 i want to spend a couple of years out in qatar after that who knows what the future will bring i wouldnt rule out a move to the premiership
3800733 this is one of the biggest weeks of my time here at the club no doubt about it the premier league is almost upon us and we have a big big game in iceland tomorrow night
3800734 these games could shape our season a good start in the league is what every team is looking for and the right result in iceland tomorrow could set us up nicely
3800735 when you see rangers getting knocked out of the champions league having reached the uefa cup final just two months ago you realise how easily it can disappear from you
3800736 its at the start of our season and in the middle of theirs so theyll be a wee bit fitter but thats less of a problem now than it was a few weeks ago
3800737 its up to us to beat them its as simple as that weve got to get through the tie
3800738 we chose to play away in the first leg and ill take the advantage of playing at our place second
3800739 but that means that we go into the first game absolutely level and with the crowd behind them theyll be up for it
3800740 weve got a chance to progress and we should progress because were a premier league side
3800741 many of us in the technology community have done a poor job of communicating to the general public why they should care about these issues with geekpac we hope to change that by driving thought leadership in this area and building a critical mass of concerned citizens who will be able to get the attention of their local politicians
3800742 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
3800743 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise
3800744 beating a dead horse through overuse of a tired old joke
3800745 a computer implemented method of scoring a plurality of linked documents
3800746 cause for celebration among those philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation
3800747 system is supposed to be designed to encourage the innovative
3800748 under our expanded charter announced last year we are branching out in new directions such as power consumption while continuing to move ahead with our graphics and workstation application benchmarks
3800749 the overriding objective is to apply spec s expertise and proven methodologies in areas that provide the most value to users vendors and testing labs worldwide
3800750 in the president alone in the courts of law or in the heads of departments
3800751 the us patent and trademark office may have a major problem on its hands the possibly unconstitutional appointment of nearly two thirds of its patent appeals judges such a constitutional flaw if legitimate could call into question the hundreds of decisions worth billions of dollars in the past eight years the flaw discovered by highly regarded intellectual property scholar john duffy of george washington university law school could also afflict the appointment of nearly half of the agencys trademark appeals judges
3800752 someone skilled in the art2 to recreate it in fact the whole reason you dont have to produce a working model is because you might not have the resources available but you want your idea protected while for example you get funding to set up a factory or what not
3800753 oi nooobody mooove this lass goat glessed an no cunt leaves til we find oot

3800760 its been a while since i read this like almost
3800761 seriously when was this whos your source are they gonna cast
3800762 anyone can look at our calendar weve been successful in any genre weve done
3800763 weve had bar mitzvahs beyonc s birthday party weddings we really try to diversify our private events were not going to change directions weve had success with every format
3800764 houstons not known for being a music town but i think its getting better
3800765 someone thought houston could support a house of blues and i dont think they thought that five or ten years ago the market is growing the population is growing and were bringing in higher level talent
3800766 we actually started doing this to win free ice cream at the oscars creamery open mike
3800767 its so hard to keep peoples attention at the symphony
3800768 i think a lot of that is from the static nature of it with the seats and the sheet music that night i realized they arent bound by having to see the music and that gives them a freedom of movement which makes them very interesting subjects to light
3800769 like im gonna get seasick or something maybe fall down
3800770 this project is so exciting if youre deeply involved with lighting like i am
3800771 were only having three rehearsals so well be lighting on the fly with some cutting edge new technology the fun part is were all playing off and feeding off each other the improv element is ever present
3800772 dominic and i drove to austin to see them and we worked several projects together
3800773 when we started this group we were writing for fun
3800774 now before we finish one project another is presented to us so our songs come from this constant pressure to complete projects and being this busy is good for us it keeps us on our toes and keeps us writing
3800775 im excited to see how the rice theater department is going to visualize our music
3800776 genevieve durham head of the dance department at texas tech will be performing her original choreography the light show is happening were playing live so the whole thing is almost improvised a kind of go with the flow thing
3800777 but honestly i hadnt picked up an instrument in years until a friend just gave me one for now at least i need those painted frets
3800778 we dont want to be just another pizza joint so we need to stand out
3800779 first the dough we use is a family recipe that goes back to the 1800s to my great grandfather in italy who ran a bakery the cheese we use is a blend of mozzarella and provolone that i just couldnt get from suppliers in houston so we buy it directly from a cheese maker in wisconsin the sauce is homemade as is everything else in the restaurant my cheesecake is made with whipped egg whites so its very light and for my tiramisu i went to work in a restaurant in rome and learned how to make it the way they do
3800780 its marinated with italian seasonings and my dad sends us the breading from home
3800781 somehow convinced that he should have been given a medical retirement
3800782 troubled about the lack of investigative journalism used by you the writer and the editor of the houston press
3800783 review ed the continuous active duty service of jason franco
3800784 and retro and political you know some really fucked up crazy awesome nuts shit
3800785 i cant get anyone in the city to return my calls so i can figure out where to buy the bins from and where to have them shipped to
3800786 ive e mailed and called and one of the volunteers chris benz who im ccing has been trying to talk to someone for two days
3800787 i figure we can definitely raise enough for 200 recycling bins
3800788 initially she wanted to wait a week or two but i told her the event is in two weeks so i need confirmation really soon
3800789 we also talked about getting larger bins for a pilot single stream recycling program houston needs 4 300 bins to try out the program and those bins are 60 a piece the current bins are only 6 25 if we could get corporate sponsorship we could probably fund the bins needed for the pilot program but id also be happy just to get 200 more 18 gallon bins out in houston
3800790 hi rich i havent heard back from marilyn since monday and the fundraiser is a week from tomorrow
3800791 helps companies take full advantage of todays environmental business opportunities from credit trading to project development and technology commercialization
3800792 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
3800793 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3800794 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
3800795 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3800796 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts
3800797 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3800798 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3800799 what was not clear was his active participation in a case critical to what hes commenting on
3800800 what was not clear was his active participation in a case critical to what hes commenting on
3800801 the pto s new interpretation of patentable subject matter provides a clear avenue to reject patent applications and to invalid issued patents on all patents on innovative computer implemented processes without regard to how meritorious or creative the innovation is
3800802 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
3800803 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way
3800804 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose
3800805 what participation i have had no participation in boldrin and levines book whatsoever
3800806 many other people contributed thoughts ideas examples and discussion mike masnick
3800807 really can you point me to a time where larry lessig published a piece arguing an issue related to a case he was involved in where he does not mention his involvement
3800808 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose
3800809 many other people contributed thoughts ideas examples and discussion mike masnick
3800810 mike well not really is from mls who apparently has the temperament and debating skills of an 8 year old when its been shown that hes been wrong
3800811 mike well not really is from mls who apparently has the temperament and debating skills of an 8 year old when its been shown that hes been wrong
3800812 lo so bella credimi lo so come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso
3800813 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
3800814 ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
3800815 si mi basta mi basta di tre cose ero del tutto certa
3800816 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
3800817 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
3800818 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
3800819 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero
3800820 i think im drowning asphyxiated i wanna break this spell that youve created youre something beautiful a contradiction i wanna play the game i want the friction
3800821 ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
3800822 si mi basta mi basta di tre cose ero del tutto certa
3800823 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3800824 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3800825 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3800826 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3800827 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3800828 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3800829 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3800830 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3800831 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3800832 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3800833 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3800834 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
3800835 our legal counsel is currently reviewing the possible next steps in the litigation and while we are disappointed by the courts decision it has no impact on our day to day operation of the business
3800836 we have not factored any income from canon into our business plans we continue to make excellent progress in the other areas of our business including conductive inks sensors and nanomaterials as well as in other activities in the electron emission and display fields such as backlights our revenue and backlog levels remain strong

3800838 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3800839 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3800840 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3800841 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3800842 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3800843 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing
3800844 death valley national park is one of our nations treasures
3800845 the courts decision is both an affirmation and a reminder to all americans that we must continue to protect the parks wildlife archeological sites and unique desert wilderness for our children and grandchildren
3800846 ill bet the horned lizards and chuckwallas are dancing in the desert washes right now

3800854 we dont have to choose between national security and protecting the environment
3800855 todays agreement maintains the navys ability to test and train while shielding whales and other vulnerable species from harmful underwater noise
3800856 this agreement confirms we can achieve environmental protection while maintaining our important national security standards
3800857 it does not need to be an either or scenario when it comes to ensuring our waters are protected and our marine wildlife is healthy
3800858 limiting sonar use in breeding grounds and other key habitat areas is essential for the conservation of whales dolphins and other marine mammals
3800859 this agreement protects both national security and our most treasured natural resources

3800872 about a year ago we became convinced that the rdf data model and linked data techniques offered the first pragmatic solution to the historical data silo problem of unconnected data
3800873 the only missing piece was how to bring context to that data and so we started the umbel project
3800874 the umbel project with its need to capture the open world aspects of the web has brought a fresh perspective and set of challenges to cyc
3800875 we are excited by the release and committed to supporting umbel as part of our overall web relevance strategy
3800876 we see umbel as a useful gateway to the more sophisticated reasoning and other tools surrounding cyc
3800877 the participation and responsiveness of cycorp and the cyc foundation have been absolutely essential to the quality of umbel
3800878 umbel is a major addition to the burgeoning linked data web
3800879 it provides a coherent data dictionary that meshes naturally with the dbpedia project openlink co founded nearly two years ago
3800880 this data dictionary orientation of umbel also increases the palatability of linked data to the closed world realm of enterprise data spaces reducing the pain associated with the timeless quest for data integration

3800888 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3800889 obviously this isnt something that we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do

3800897 we appreciate the courts judgment that our license agreement with nano proprietary remains valid
3800898 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3800899 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models

3800959 recently we came across a rather unfortunate exploit case for the access snapshot viewer activex vulnerability that took advantage of a property of the activex system to exploit ie users who did not have the vulnerable control installed how does one exploit a vulnerability that does not exist on a system you say sadly attackers have found a way to install the vulnerable access snapshot viewer activex control through internet explorer prior to exploiting it
3800960 once this vulnerable control is installed on the victims computer it is exploited in the same way as if the control was installed all along to top it off this attack is carried out as a drive by attack so the unprotected user may never know that they were vulnerable or had been targeted let alone infected

3800975 the potential legal implications of texting while driving go far beyond the possibility of a mere traffic violation

3800995 there is a great deal of excitement in the quantum condensed matter community about the iron pnictides
3800996 for more than 20 years our perspective was limited to cuprates and it is hoped that this new class of materials will help us understand the mechanism for high temperature superconductivity
3800997 precisely how this happens is one of the challenging questions in strongly correlated electron systems
3800998 but even though we dont know the precise mechanism we are still able to make some general predictions about the behavior of pnictides and weve suggested a number of experiments that can test these predictions

3801009 lamento la virulencia del ataque del que he sido v ctima
3801010 y creo que las nuevas generaciones del partido que no hemos estado en primera l nea en los ltimos 20 a os debemos hacer un esfuerzo por no heredar odios que no son nuestros y hablar con un discurso personal sin ataduras y sin miedos
3801011 no es mi estilo contestar en los medios a declaraciones que hacen otros compa eros
3801012 lo que no quiere decir que como dirigente del partido en la isla y portavoz de la tercera ciudad de canarias y segunda de tenerife renuncie a mi derecho a expresar lo que me parece que debe de ser el futuro de mi partido en la isla pero siempre en positivo y sin ir en contra de nadie
3801013 un compromiso que he generado por ser hijo de un viejo militante del psoe educado en una cultura de partido muy diferente a la que otros practican y si yo traicionase esa forma de entender el partido estar a traicion ndome a m mismo y a mis ra ces
3801014 no puedo entrar a contestar porque no ser a bueno a adi pero s me reafirmo palabra por palabra en mis manifestaciones porque han sido en positivo haciendo un llamamiento a la unidad y al conjunto del partido en tenerife para poner en valor las que cosas que nos unen y dejar en un segundo plano las cosas que nos diferencian
3801015 mantengo mi convicci n de que es necesario un relevo generacional lo he mantenido en el pasado en el presente y en el futuro
3801016 desde esta plataforma al margen de la pol tica tengo la posibilidad en mi trabajo de contactar con mucha gente que me ratifica que una parte muy importante de la sociedad tinerfe a nos demanda ese relevo generacional

3801024 an emerging theme for threats in july seems to be new variations on old attack methods
3801025 following on from june web based malware continues to be a treacherous threat and organizations would be smart to build their web security defenses in preparation for what could be on the horizon
3801026 the root cause is unvalidated input which can lead to sql injection among other things including cross site scripting passive manipulation and other things
3801027 the point is that there are tools out there such that if you point them to a web site they will try injecting sql into every web site they can find theres even a firefox extension
3801028 this is just one of several tools designed for site designers to scan their own web sites but thats part of the problem its freely available and anyone can use it the bad guys can use it just as easily as the developers themselves
3801029 developers are under pressure to release software that fulfills functional requirements security requirements are generally not part of functional requirements the no 1 rule is to release the software that does its job by this date if you cant do anything else do that
3801030 the way wed like to see development going is youd like to have a security guy involved from the beginning youd like to have developers knowing or caring enough or having time enough to test these things themselves
3801031 google sites is yet another way that spammers have programmatically defeated captcha completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart mechanisms a validation technique that is designed to defend against automated sign up tools frequently used by spammers by requiring the user to enter a string of letters
3801032 while google sites spam accounts for only 1 percent of all spam currently we anticipate that this techniques popularity will rival that of its predecessors google docs calendar and pages spam if this is the case then we may see spam levels increase in the months ahead
3801033 both connelly and bellamy bring relevant skills but they lack experience in the healthcare sector or nhs
3801034 a similar lack of understanding of the nhs has led to problems in the past within connecting for health so it is vital that they are brought up to speed quickly and make an effort to win over sceptical clinicians
3801035 both connelly and bellamy are experienced cios and used to running large it projects both will also bring skills from the private sector as is increasingly common for public sector cios neither of them are career civil servants

3801038 once surgery becomes an option its absolutely critical that clinicians have the ability to identify the seizure onset zone in infants and children as early as possible
3801039 the earlier the surgery takes place the less likely that damage can occur from seizure activity during the childs critical brain development period we hope to develop a safer and simpler diagnostic tool for identifying the seizure onset zone one that is timely and thus will allow for repair and subsequent normal brain development in these children

3801043 there is an urgent need to reassess the current policies and incentives so that the business of wind gets serious about generating power and not just installing wind farms and reaping benefits from fiscal incentives in the current scheme which gives an accelerated depreciation benefit of 80 per cent and other tax incentives for installation of the plants wind energy has become the business of cash rich investors who take advantage of tax benefits and are not serious about generation of power
3801044 it is no wonder says cse that hotel companies spinning mills and even film stars have invested in wind energy

3801059 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
3801060 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
3801061 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
3801062 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
3801063 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
3801064 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
3801065 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
3801066 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
3801067 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
3801068 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
3801069 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way

3801075 frankly i think thats disgusting honestly theyre seven and nine years old so young
3801076 i find it sad that they ruined an otherwise pretty awesome ceremony with those fakes
3801077 so forget beijing 2008 best opening ceremony so far is still sydney 2000 they didnt see it necessary to use computer generated images to impress the world
3801078 apparently the little girl whose voice was used yang peiyi wasnt cute enough it was deemed bad for chinas image to show a little girl with crooked teeth
3801079 something about passing over a child for crooked teeth just seems well wrong
3801080 china wants the olympics as a stage to present a picture perfect image to the outside world and perfection was clearly the goal for the dazzling opening ceremonies
3801081 eager to put on a perfect olympics beijing has swept its streets of fake designer handbags pirated dvds and phony corporate logos that dedication to authenticity apparently does not extend to olympics ceremonies
3801082 the song was pre recorded the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
3801083 and if advertisers business is off they are normally not going to spend as much on advertising
3801084 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3801085 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3801086 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3801087 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3801088 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3801089 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning

3801104 jack and i earmarked the money for the dogs ongoing medical expenses which can run very high
3801105 we expected the medical expenses for freddies eyes to be around 3 000 but the bills totaled over 10 000
3801106 thanks to the kindness of tom and his internet marketing students we had the resources needed to help restore freddies eyesight
3801107 since receiving that check from tom weve not had to turn away even one dog in need of medical attention

3801130 it isnt an issue of playing here its family issues hes trying to resolve if he was going to play somewhere else i would have entertained trading him but it wasnt an issue of playing somewhere lese its an issue of whether hell continue with his hockey career or not
3801131 we have a number of small interests but if you add them up it puts together a sizeable list and a big chunk of business
3801132 in such a way that it might be listed in the future if times are good and the size is sufficient but its not something that we are actively working on at the moment
3801133 in 2008 we will not be doing anything but in 2009 it is possible that shareholder will decide or request us to persue it but its not something that we have ready
3801134 the government alone cannot decide our fate it has to be the big man in the kremlin
3801135 to the best of our knowledge so far the shareholder has not made a decision on whether to list or not
3801136 as management we are trying to make the company ready for this if and when the owners decide to do it
3801137 but we dont exclude the possibility that we will have to expand into offshore quite aggressively and to order several rigs and drill ships that will require a couple of billion of dollars in investments this would be possible but not comfortable to just raise through debt market so we will go for public equity

3801153 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3801154 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3801155 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great

3801163 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
3801164 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent

3801184 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions
3801185 metronet workers can join a final salary pension scheme but tube lines wants to keep the door closed on it and tube lines members are also denied the travel facilities that metronet staff enjoy
3801186 tube liness bottom line seems to be that it is ok for its staff to be treated as second class citizens so long as the dividends keep rolling in for its shareholders
3801187 we are disappointed the rmt is taking this stance and passengers have every right to feel angry over the proposed action
3801188 the rmts vote against the offer and the length of their proposed action defy reason and perhaps suggests there is an ulterior motive behind the rejection they have made no secret of their desire for tube maintenance to return to public ownership
3801189 despite rmt claims that the deal is not equal to that set at metronet tube lines believes its pay and conditions are very competitive and amongst the best in the rail industry

3801200 the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government
3801201 the moral and constitutional obligations of our representatives in washington are to protect our liberty not coddle the world precipitating no win wars while bringing bankruptcy and economic turmoil to our people
3801202 man is not free unless government is limited theres a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics as government expands liberty contracts
3801203 the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite
3801204 a government that is big enough to give you all you want
3801205 i find myself in a new and strange position here president cabinet gen scott and all deferring to me by some strange operation of magic i seem to have become the power of the land all tell me that i am held responsible for the fate of the nation and that all its resources shall be placed at my disposal
3801206 it is a proud and glorious thing to see a whole people here simple and unsophisticated looking up to me as their deliverer from tyranny
3801207 this man utterly winning and modest and soft spoken in all his personal contacts simply could not down inside look long enough on the great figure he was becoming could not get enough of the savor of admiration and love that were coming to him what buried sense of personal inadequacy was gnawing at this man that he had to see himself so constantly through the eyes of men and women who looked upon him as a hero out of legend and myth
3801208 soldiers i have heard there was danger here and i have come to place myself at your head and to share it with you i fear now but one thing that you will not find foemen worthy of your steel

3801217 heilig is degene die s nachts zijn dienaar mohammed van de masdjid al haram de gewijde moskee te mekkah naar de masdjid al aqsah heeft gebracht waarvan wij de omgeving hebben gezegend opdat wij hem van onze tekenen lieten zien

3801219 ik huil om een jongeman die later dan mij is gezonden waardoor meer mensen van zijn volk het paradijs binnenkomen dan er van mijn volk binnenkomen
3801220 je volk kan dit niet aan ga terug naar je heer en vraag hem om vermindering
3801221 bij allah ik heb de mensen van isra l minder dan dit gevraagd doch zijn zij verzwakt en hebben het nagelaten
3801222 ik heb mijn verplichting opgelegd en heb haar verlicht voor mijn dienaren het is vijf maar in feite vijftig mijn uitspraak is niet aan verdere veranderingen onderhevig
3801223 als hij dat heeft verteld dan heeft hij ook de waarheid verteld
3801224 ik geloof hem in meer dan alleen dit ik geloof hem in alle berichten die van de hemel en weer gaan
3801225 op een dag waren we samen met de boodschapper van allah in een huis van een van de ansaar een bewoner van de stad medina die de moslims hielp we vormden een djamaaah gemeenschap
3801226 de gastheer en al degenen die binnen zijn mag ik binnenkomen ik heb een wens ik moet met jullie praten
3801227 dit is lain vervloekte iblies de satan moge de vloek van allah op hem rusten
3801228 jaa rasoel allah geef mij uw toestemming om hem te doden
3801229 jaa o oemar weet jij niet dat hij uitstel van allah heeft gekregen tot een bepaalde tijd laat hem
3801230 doe de deur open laat hem binnen komen hij is hier gekomen met allahs bevel probeer te begrijpen wat hij jullie gaat zeggen luister goed naar hem
3801231 salaam vrede zij jou mohammed en vrede op jullie o djamaaah moeslimien moslimgemeenschap
3801232 de salaam vredesgroet is van allah jaa lain o vervloekte
3801233 je zei dat je voor iets kwam waar kom je voor
3801234 mijn heer allah heeft een engel naar mij toegestuurd die tegen mij zei
3801235 dus zo komt het dus jaa o mohammed dat ik met deze opdracht naar jou ben gekomen je mag vragen wat je wilt en als ik jou de waarheid niet zou vertellen zullen mijn vijanden zich met mij amuseren het is zeker heel vernederend als je vijanden met je spotten en dat kan ik niet toestaan
3801236 aangezien het feit dat jij de waarheid zult vertellen vertel me dan van wie jij het meest een afgunst hebt niet mag
3801237 dat ben jij jaa o mohammed onder de schepselen van allah is er niemand die ik niet minder mag
3801238 de moettaqie degene met taqwa godvrees jonge mensen die al hun bezittingen hebben weggeven op de weg van allah
3801239 de geduldige oelamaa die van allerlei twijfelachtige zaken afstand houden
3801240 iemand die bij het schoonmaken de onreine plek drie maal wast en doorgaat met dit te doen
3801241 de geduldige arme persoon die zijn benodigheden aan niemand vertelt en niet over zijn toestand klaagt bij anderen
3801242 jaa o mohammed hij zal zijn benodigdheden niet aan iemand die zelf ook in deze toestand verkeert vertellen wie zijn behoeftes drie dagen achter elkaar wel aan iemand vertelt zal niet tot de geduldige bij allah gerekend worden dus zo merk ik aan zijn houding of hij geduldig is
3801243 je ziet hem halal geoorloofde dingen kopen en naar zijn familie brengen
3801244 als mijn oemmah volgelingen opstaat voor het gebed wat gebeurt er dan met jou
3801245 jaa o mohammed dan begin ik heel erg te beven
3801246 omdat als een dienaar van allah soedjoed doet zich neerbuigt tot op de grond voor allah hij hem dan een graad verhoogt
3801247 en als ze vasten wat gebeurt er dan met jou
3801248 en als ze de hadj verplichte bedevaart naar mekka verrichten
3801249 en wat als ze de heilige qoraan lezen wat gebeurt er dan met jou
3801250 jaa o mohammed dan is het heel erg met mij gesteld dan is het alsof degene die aalmoezen geeft een zaag pakt en mij ermee doormidden zaagt
3801251 dat zal ik je vertellen het geven van aalmoezen heeft vier mooie schoonheden allah zal zijn baraka zegeningen in dit geval zijn bezit vermeerderen allah zal hem geliefd maken onder het volk allah zal hem door middel van de gegeven sadaqa liefdadigheid een sed een stuw dam belemmering tussen hem en de jahannam hel maken allah zal zijn problemen moeilijkheden en vloeken van hem wegnemen
3801252 hij was het niet met mij eens in de tijd van djahilija de tijd van onwetendheid voor de komst van de islam nu hij de islam betreden heeft zal hij mij nooit gehoorzamen
3801253 ik zweer bij allah waar ik hem zag ben ik van hem weggelopen
3801254 ik schaam me zo erg voor hem zoals de engelen zich voor de meest barmhartige schamen
3801255 oh ik wou dat ik verlost van hem was als hij alleen bleef en mij ook met rust liet maar hij laat mij niet met rust
3801256 al hamdoe liellah alle lof aan allah die mij veel geluk heeft gegeven tot een bepaalde tijd en die jou zondig heeft gemaakt door je schuld tot een bepaalde tijd dag der opstanding
3801257 weet je niet jaa o mohammed dat dat degenen zijn die hun bezit materie niet lief hebben
3801258 terugkomend bij de jongeren wij kunnen heel goed met elkaar opschieten en mijn kinderen kunnen ook goed met jullie kinderen opschieten denk bijvoorbeeld aan de opstandigheid van tieners tegen hun ouders
3801259 een gedeelte van deze duivels zijn bij de abids mensen die ibadah doen allah aanbidden weer een ander gedeelte bij de zahids mensen die zeer veel ibadah doen
3801260 weet je niet jaa o mohommed dat de leugen bij mij is en dat ik de eertste leugenaar ben wie liegt is mijn vriend en wie zweert bij een leugen is mijn geliefde weet je niet jaa o mohammed dat ik heb gelogen en in naam van allah heb gezworen bij adam en hawwa eva
3801261 en jij zwoer tot hen ik ben voor u zeker een oprechte raadgever
3801262 wie op zijn talaq het recht om te scheiden zweert wordt een zondaar ook al heeft hij dit 1 keer gedaan en heeft hij gelijk wie van zijn talaq alle drie de rechten heeft gebruikt zal een zondaar zijn en is zijn vrouw haram verboden voor hem ze kunnen niet meer samen blijven en als zij toch samen kinderen krijgen dan zullen deze kinderen waladi zinas buitenechtelijk zijn
3801263 als hij op wil staan om het gebed te doen dan hou ik hem op door waswasa boze influisteringen aan hem te geven
3801264 je hebt nog tijd zat je hebt het nu zo druk maak dit eerst maar af je doet het straks wel
3801265 als hij mij weer overwint dan zal ik hem tijdens de salaat islamitisch gebed lastig gaan vallen als hij bidt dan zal ik hem over zijn gezicht aaien en zijn voorhoofd kussen voor zijn gehoorzaamheid
3801266 als ik dit ook niet kan bereiken bij iemand zal ik als hij het gebed alleen doet tegen hem zeggen dat hij de salaat snel moet afmaken en dat zal hij als een haan die snel zijn eten met zijn snavel uit het grind pikt doen
3801267 hierna zal deze persoon ons blijven gehoorzamen naar ons luisteren en doen wat wij zeggen
3801268 ik ga naar degenen die arm hulploos en zielig zijn en beveel ze om de salaat islamitisch gebed niet te verrichten
3801269 en zo zal hij het gebed nalaten en zelfs ongelovig worden mocht hij aan deze ziekte overlijden dan zal hij allah in gazaab woede vinden jaa o mohammed als er leugens in mijn woorden zijn dan moge een schorpioen mij steken als ik lieg moge allah as van mij maken mohammed ben jij opgelucht over je oemmah volgelingen terwijl ik 1 6 van hen uit het geloof heb gehaald
3801270 dat zijn degenen die de salaat islamitisch gebed bewust nalaten
3801271 als de wind des doods blaast en de hitte heerst wat gebruik jij als je schaduw
3801272 degenen die niet deelnemen aan de djoemaaah gezamenlijk vrijdagsgebed in de moskee
3801273 het gehinnik van paarden die op djihaad in de heilige oorlog op weg gaan voor allah
3801274 het horen van mensen die dag en nacht vergiffenis vragen aan allah
3801275 de vele salaats islamitische gebeden die in djamaaah een groep verricht worden
3801276 ik eet van ieder dier dat niet in naam van allah geslacht is
3801277 ik ben ook mede eigenaar van goederen waar geen toevlucht tegen mij iblies bij allah wordt gezocht
3801278 ook bij sexuele gemeenschap als er geen toevlucht tegen de duivel bij allah is gezocht heb ik iblies duivel samen met hem en met zijn vrouw gemeenschap
3801279 ik heb aan allah een huis gevraagd en daarom heb ik de saunas gekregen
3801280 ik heb om een gebedsplaats gevraagd en heb de markten gekregen
3801281 ik heb om een boek gevraagd en heb daar de gedichten bundels voor gekregen
3801282 ik heb om een bed vriend gevraagd en heb de dronkaards ervoor gekregen
3801283 ik heb om een hulp gevraagd en heb de qadarijjas hiervoor gekregen
3801284 ik heb om broeders en zusters gevraagd en heb de mensen die hun tijd aan masijjah nutteloze dingen verspillen gekregen
3801285 de reden dat ik je geloof is omdat je het bewijst met verzen uit de qoraan
3801286 ik heb van allah gewild dat ik de kinderen van adam kon zien en zij mij niet dit is ook gebeurd
3801287 ik heb gevraagd aan allah of hij een weg voor mij kon banen in het bloed van de kinderen van adam
3801288 ik heb al deze dingen gekregen en ik zal je zeggen dat ik meer mensen aan mijn kant heb dan jij zult hebben tot de dag des oordeels
3801289 ik heb een zoon die de taak heeft om ibadahas aanbiddingen die in het geheim worden gedaan te openbaren
3801290 als de duivel overwint dan verliest degene die ibadah aanbidding deed 99 van zijn 100 zegeningen hij houdt er dus maar een over dus krijgt een dienaar die iets goed doet en dit geheim houdt krijgt hier 100 zegingen voor
3801291 ik heb ook een andere zoon die de mensen verblindt als zij naar islamitische bijeenkomsten gaan waar geleerden lesgeven ze beginnen slaperig te worden kunnen niet goed slapen ze gaan gapen en worden snel afgeleid zo krijgen ze ook geen zegening
3801292 als een vrouw in het bijzijn van mannen zit die niet wettig zijn voor haar komt er een duivel bij haar op schoot zitten zodat zij voor degenen die naar haar kijken aantrekkelijk wordt gemaakt lijkt
3801293 jaa o mohammed ik kan de mens niet af laten dwalen
3801294 als ik de macht had gekregen zou ik iedereen die
3801295 ik kan je bemiddelaar zijn ik geef je mijn woord dat jij naar de djennah het paradijs kan gaan
3801296 jaa rasoel allah o boodschapper van allah het zal volgens de wil van allah gaan de inkt die deze wet heeft geschreven is opgedroogd het kan niet meer worden veranderd deze dingen zullen tot de qiejamah opstanding gebeuren degene die jou tot profeet heeft gemaakt degene die jou tussen de mensheid heeft gekozen als de verkorene jij bent de heer van de djennah paradijs gemeenschap ik iblies ben de heer van de zondaars en van de gemeenschap van de hel
3801297 voorwaar de kennis daarover is slechts bij mijn rabb heer niemand kan over de tijd duidelijkheid geven dan hij
3801298 voorwaar de kennis daarover is slechts bij allah maar de meeste mensen weten het niet
3801299 zij de ongelovigen wachten op niets dan het uur dat onverwachts over hen kan komen
3801300 het uur zal niet komen totdat de tijd zo snel zal passeren dat een jaar voorbijgaat alsof het een maand is en een maand als een week en een week als een dag en een dag als een uur en een uur als de tijd die men nodigt heeft om een palmblad te verbranden
3801301 voordat het uur komt zullen er jaren van bedrog en misleiding zijn waar een eerlijk persoon niet geloofd wordt en een persoon die liegt gelooft zal worden en de onbenullige zal het voor het zeggen hebben
3801302 voorwaar er zal een tijd komen waarin de mensen zullen leven dat een gelovige niet bezorgd zal zijn hoe hij zijn geld heeft verdiend of het halal of haram is
3801303 voorwaar onder de tekenen van de dag des oordeels is dat men alleen diegene groet met de groet van de islaam die men kent
3801304 het uur zal niet komen tot de tijd dat een man zijn huis zal verlaten en zijn schoen zweep of stok hem zal vertellen wat er met zijn familie gebeurt sinds hij het huis heeft verlaten
3801305 als de dood er niet was zou een ieder die ayatul koersie reciteert na iedere fard gebed rechtstreeks naar het paradijs gaan
3801306 en zij kunnen niets van zijn kennis omvatten dan wat hij wil
3801307 wa la jaoedoehoe hief dhoehoema wa hoewa al aliyoe al adiem
3801308 en waneer de uitspraak over hen komt laten wij voor hen een beest uit de aarde tevoorschijn komen dat tot hen spreekt
3801309 het uur zal niet komen tot je tien tekenen zult zien de rook de dajjal het beest de opkomst van de zon uit het westen het afdalen van jezus as de zoon van maryam gog en magog de drie grondverschuivingen n in het oosten n in het westen en n in arabi aan het eind daarvan zal er een vuur vanuit de richting van aden jemen uitbarsten en de mensen naar de plaats van de laatste bijeenkomst drijven
3801310 het beest zal uit de aarde verschijnen en het zal de staf van mozes as en de ring van salomo hebben
3801311 het beest zal de neuzen van de ongelovige met de ring vernielen zodat de mensen die om de tafel zitten en elkaar zullen aanspreken met de woorden o gelovige of o ongelovige dat wil zeggen de positie van ieder zal duidelijk worden ibn madjah kietab al fitan hadith 4061 2 1351 1252 abd allah ibn amar zei ik heb een hadith van de profeet vzmh uit het hoofd geleerd die ik sinds die tijd niet vergeten ben ik hoorde de profeet vzmh zeggen het eerste teken van het uur zal zijn het rijzen van de zon uit het westen zijn en de verschijning van het beest in de ochtend zodra een van deze gebeurtenissen zal plaats vinden dan wordt het meteen door de anderen gevolgd
3801312 dajjaal heeft een oog waaraan hij blind is tussen zijn ogen is het woord kafier d w z ongelovige geschreven
3801313 tijdens mijn slaap zag ik mijzelf in een droom en maakte de tawaf rond de kaaba
3801314 ibn qatan is een man uit de zonen van al mostalieq uit khozaa
3801315 allah is niet blind de nep messias is blind aan zijn rechter oog het is net een drijvende druif
3801316 op een ochtend sprak de boodschapper van allah allahs vrede en genade zij met hem over dajjaal
3801317 er is nooit een profeet geweest die zijn mensen niet voor de eenogige leugenaar heeft gewaarschuwd
3801318 tussen zijn ogen is kaf fa ra d w z kafier geschreven
3801319 iedere gelovige zal in staat zijn om het te lezen analfabeet en alfabeet
3801320 wat authentiek is is dat geleerden ervan uitgaan dat dit geschrift tussen de ogen van de dajjaal letterlijk is en dat het om een echt geschreven woord gaat dat allah als teken een uit vele tekenen zal laten zien om het ongeloof en de leugens van deze dajjaal te verklaren ook dient dit als bewijs voor iedere moslim alfabeet of analfabeet en dit bewijs zal worden bedekt voor degenen die de kant van de dajjaal kiezen
3801321 wij gingen vlug naar het klooster daar troffen wij een grote man aan met zijn handen aan de achterkant van zijn nek gebonden en met ijzeren schakels vastgeketend
3801322 tussen de schepping van adam en de dag der opstanding is er geen ergere schepping dan de schepping van dajjaal
3801323 tussen de schepping van adam en de dag der opstanding is er geen andere rampspoed die groter is dan de rampspoed van dajjaal
3801324 heb je de boodschapper van allah allahs vrede en genade zij met hem niet horen zeggen dat hij dajjaal geen nageslacht zal hebben
3801325 dat beide ogen van dajjaal verminkt zijn omdat de overleveringen allemaal authentiek zijn het rechteroog zal het oog zijn waaraan hij blind is en wat er verminkt mamsooh uit zal zien het linkeroog zal ook verminkt zijn wat zich uit door een dik stuk huid dat over het oog heen hangt
3801326 waarlijk hij is in de syrische zee of de zee bij jemen nee in tegendeel hij is in het oosten hij is in het oosten hij is in het oosten
3801327 de boodschapper van allah allahs vrede en genade zij met hem verhaalde en hij zei
3801328 de boodschapper van allah allahs vrede en genade zij met hem heeft gezegd
3801329 hij zal zeggen ik heb bijna toestemming om te verschijnen
3801330 ik liep naar een man toe die onder de metgezellen van de profeet vrede en zegeningen zij met hem leefde en zei hem vertel me een hadith die je van de boodschapper van allah hoorde over de dajjaal
3801331 hij zal gevolgd worden door mensen die gezichten hebben als verbrande schilden
3801332 de dajjaal zal naar de vijver bij marriqanaat gaan een vallei in medina en de meeste die hem zullen benaderen zullen vrouwen zijn totdat een man naar zijn schoonmoeder zijn moeder zijn dochter zijn zus en zijn tante zal komen en ze vast zal binden uit angst dat ze naar hem toe gaan
3801333 de dajjaal zal slechts met een oog kunnen zien hij zal blind zijn in zijn linker oog en hij zal dik haar hebben hij zal een paradijs en een hel bij zich hebben maar zijn paradijs zal een hel zijn en zijn hel zal een paradijs zijn
3801334 de boodschapper van allah vrede en zegeningen van allah zij met hem zei ik weet wat de dajjaal met zich mee zal brengen hij zal twee stromende rivieren brengen
3801335 o boodschapper van allah hoe lang zal hij op aarde blijven
3801336 veertig dagen een dag zal zoals een jaar zijn een dag zoals een maand een dag zoals een week en de rest zal als normale dagen zijn
3801337 ik getuig dat jij de dajjaal bent over wie de boodschapper van allah vrede en zegeningen van allah zij met hem ons verteld heeft
3801338 wat denken jullie als ik hem doodt en hem vervolgens weer tot leven breng zullen jullie dan nog twijfelen
3801339 bij allah ik ben nooit zekerder van jou geweest dan dat ik vandaag ben
3801340 een deel van zijn fitnah zal ontstaan omdat hij tegen een bedouin zal zeggen denk je dat als ik je vader en moeder weer tot leven wek dat je dan zal getuigen dat ik je heer ben
3801341 allaahoemma ienni aoodhoe bika mien adaab al qabrie wa aoodhoe bika mien fitnatie al maseeh dajjaal wa aoodhoe bieka mien fitnat il mahyaa wa fitnat l mamaat
3801342 de boodschapper van allah vrede en zegeningen van allah zij met hem zei wanneer iemand van jullie de tashahhoed zegt laat hem dan toevlucht zoeken bij allah tegen vier dingen
3801343 allaahumma ienni aoodhoe bieka mien adhaabie djahannam wa mien adhaabie al qabrie wa mien fitnatie l mahyaa wa mien sharrie fitnatie al maseehie dajjaal
3801344 degene van jullie die hem zien de dajjaal laat hem de openingsverzen van soerat al kahf reciteren
3801345 degene die de eerste tien ayat onthoudt van het begin van soerat al kahf zal beschermd worden door de dajjaal
3801346 de reden voor dit verschil is omdat aan het begin van deze soerah veel wonderen en tekenen staan en degene die hierover nadenkt zal niet bedrogen worden door de fitnah van de dajjaal
3801347 degene die soerat al kahf op vrijdag reciteert zal een licht voor zichzelf hebben van de ene vrijdag tot de volgende
3801348 degene die iets hoort over de dajjaal laat hem ver weg blijven van hem want een man zal hem benaderen en zal aannemen dat hij de waarheid spreekt vanwege de grote wonderen waarmee hij gezonden is
3801349 o moslim o dienaar van allah er is een jood achter me kom hier en dood hem
3801350 de boodschapper van allah vrede en zegeningen van allah zij met hem heeft gezegd de dajjaal zal opdoemen in mijn oemmah en hij zal veertig blijven
3801351 ik hoorde de boodschapper van allah vrede zij met hem zeggen de zoon van maryam zal de dajjaal vermoorden bij de poort van loedd
3801352 elke kaafir die de geur van isa ruikt zal sterven en zijn geur zal zich uitstrekken tot zover zijn blikveld reikt hij zal dan de dajjaal zoeken en hij zal hem vinden en doden bij de poort van ludd
3801353 de boodschapper van allah vrede en zegeningen zij met hem heeft gezegd de dajjaal zal opduiken op het moment wanneer religieuze binding laag is en de kennis schaars zal zijn
3801354 o mensen wat weerhoudt jullie ervan om tegen deze leugenaar te vechten
3801355 stap naar voren en leid het gebed o geest van allah
3801356 laat jullie imaam naar voren stappen en het gebed leiden
3801357 an emerging theme for threats in july seems to be new variations on old attack methods
3801358 following on from june web based malware continues to be a treacherous threat and organizations would be smart to build their web security defenses in preparation for what could be on the horizon
3801359 the root cause is unvalidated input which can lead to sql injection among other things including cross site scripting passive manipulation and other things
3801360 the point is that there are tools out there such that if you point them to a web site they will try injecting sql into every web site they can find theres even a firefox extension
3801361 this is just one of several tools designed for site designers to scan their own web sites but thats part of the problem its freely available and anyone can use it the bad guys can use it just as easily as the developers themselves
3801362 developers are under pressure to release software that fulfills functional requirements security requirements are generally not part of functional requirements the no 1 rule is to release the software that does its job by this date if you cant do anything else do that
3801363 the way wed like to see development going is youd like to have a security guy involved from the beginning youd like to have developers knowing or caring enough or having time enough to test these things themselves
3801364 google sites is yet another way that spammers have programmatically defeated captcha completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart mechanisms a validation technique that is designed to defend against automated sign up tools frequently used by spammers by requiring the user to enter a string of letters
3801365 while google sites spam accounts for only 1 percent of all spam currently we anticipate that this techniques popularity will rival that of its predecessors google docs calendar and pages spam if this is the case then we may see spam levels increase in the months ahead

3801367 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
3801368 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
3801369 this is for the birds poo facial promises smoother skin
3801370 when i was 12 or 13 years old she had told me that in 18th century japan the geisha who were known for their beauty and their porcelain skin needed something to remove all the heavy make up they wore
3801371 at the time the make up contained lead which was very damaging to their skin
3801372 so they tried everything to take it off and nothing worked and then they tried the nightingale droppings and it not only worked but it left their skin smooth
3801373 when i explain to my customers they think i misspoke because of my accent
3801374 but after they understand many of them are willing to trust me and give it a try
3801375 she e mailed me some information i definitely needed to know more before i committed to the procedure
3801376 but then i thought about it and the japanese have been doing it for such a long time and the geishas have such beautiful skin even though they put such harsh chemicals on it
3801377 it doesnt feel as abrasive as some other facials and it smells organic
3801378 and it doesnt tingle or burn it just sort of stays there its a really simple calming facial
3801379 there is a fair amount of seasonality in broadband so a dip in the second quarter is not altogether unexpected
3801380 however the magnitude of this decline suggests that the current economic environment is hampering the ability of service providers to garner new customers
3801381 this is not a situation where existing consumers are dropping broadband en masse rather the number of new subscribers is dwindling in lean economic times people are less inclined to assume an additional recurring monthly expense
3801382 in other words between 2007 and 2008 the median download speed increased by only four tenths of a megabit per second from 1 9 mbps to 2 3 mbps and the median upload speed barely changed from 371 to 435 kbps
3801383 at this rate it will take the united states more than 100 years to catch up with current internet speeds in japan
3801384 we need high speed internet for our homes schools hospitals and workplaces speed defines what is possible on the internet
3801385 it determines whether we will have the 21st century networks we need to create the jobs of the future develop our economy and support innovations in telemedicine education public safety and public services to improve our lives and communities

3801400 under this strategy the time horizon for redeployment would be negotiated with the iraqi government and nested within a more assertive approach to regional diplomacy the united states would make clear that iraq and america share a common interest in achieving sustainable stability in iraq and that the united states is willing to help support the iraqi government and build its security and governance capacity over the long term but only so long as iraqis continue to make meaningful political progress

3801527 instead of sowing democracy in the muslim world bushs war on terror has led to billowing instability from gaza and the west bank to lebanon from syria and iraq to turkey and iran and from afghanistan to pakistan the candidate most apt to rectify bushs errors is the one who best understands that radical islamism is above all a threat to states and societies of the muslim world that the jihadist movement is both cause and symptom of an internecine conflict there

3801653 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
3801654 in any game to score and win 1 0 is a boost especially for the forward
3801655 i thought we created a lot of chances and although they put a lot of pressure on us i thought we could have won by more

3801690 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
3801691 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
3801692 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

3801763 i can only do that in my own home here however i must consider the needs of the servant who must carry the buckets of water

3801767 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show
3801768 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it
3801769 it is really a cooling off not this big dramatic breakup
3801770 whos to say where it will end up but now he has a lot going on
3801771 if she said she wants kids and hes not ready thats not being needy its being honest
3801772 locating the contemporary museum at the bowling center site changes the historic design of the main parade and would result in an adverse effect

3801775 and if youve already bought it buy another one and if youve already bought another one get another one after that
3801776 our country faces very grave economic military and foreign policy challenges and many americans of all political parties will vote for a change in november barack obama is the only candidate who offers that change of direction we need
3801777 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3801778 bernanke certainly has a deeper understanding of the academic research and tends to rely more on the views of other economists and the federal reserve
3801779 in the long run youre better off having a broader reliance on different peoples work and views
3801780 i wrote the book because i felt people need to know how bernanke is different from greenspan
3801781 people are confused about who he is people view him as greenspans younger brother
3801782 current uncertain economic conditions combined with a significant downturn in rv demand
3801783 the price of gas will impact a persons travel habits but for the rv industry its really about the lack of financing thats causing the current downward trend in rv sales
3801784 consumer confidence is factor too people have less confidence to make a larger ticket purchase and rvs are discretionary purchases so theyre more difficult to justify
3801785 but its not like the suv market where everyone is running away because of the price of gas
3801786 one of the common ways people finance an rv purchase especially for the bigger vehicles is by taking out a home equity loan and that has of course become more problematic lately because home prices have fallen and people have less home equity
3801787 theres about four five six different variables not just one focus point you have escalating food prices you cant turn on the tv or radio without hearing its another record setting day for fuel and i think thats probably one of the biggest concerns right now not only of rvers but everybody they dont know where this is going to settle in
3801788 on the low end you have a folding camping trailer that you can buy new for 5 000 and at the high end you have luxury motor homes that can cost you in excess of 400 000 the vast majority of vehicles sold are towable trailers with an average retail price of under 40 000 and theyre typically getting used between 25 and 35 days per year
3801789 we think they are postponing their purchases until their confidence in the economy improves
3801790 people might not be buying new rvs in the numbers they once used to but they are still using them and so dealers are focusing on parts and accessories customer service remains a big part of their overall business plan
3801791 theyre also watching their inventory very closely to make sure they dont order more than they can sell
3801792 many of the people in the rv lifestyle are committed to it its a way of life rv ers are like modern day covered wagon people theyre very patriotic and want to see their country
3801793 so if the economy goes bad they make adjustments they are typically very dedicated and if times are hard they can just go on shorter vacations
3801794 el s bado y domingo he vuelto a ser evo morales
3801795 as me distraigo y me acuerdo de c mo era la vida antes de llegar aqu

3801815 youre always thinking of me and youre always giving me things i cant repay you for any of these its not that i dont like them

3801819 ishikawas daughter is in the philippines and has made a 10 million us dollar investment in matsuuras company
3801820 fujimoto and matsuura are the only people i can have a decent conversation with everybodys so conservative and uptight that i have to wear this damn tie just to meet with them
3801821 anyway business is a mans world they say when ayaya was elected president i thought ayaka was lying when she told me
3801822 well apparently one of the younger board members whats her name
3801823 well lets just say i no a lot of people find it difficult to communicate with her sometimes anyway hopefully matsuuras managed to buy them all off im hoping for a small crowd from their conglomerate today
3801824 how come its only ayumi who gets called by a nickname i want to be called a nickname too
3801825 well youre names too short if she does call you maichin shell have to say one more syllable more effort on her part and you know yoshiko told us not to let her strain herself in anything
3801826 anyway i dont mind being called my name at least she calls me by my name right rika chan
3801827 sniff rika chan you smell different today sniff sniff have you been sleeping in yoshikos room
3801828 no doubt ive done her laundry enough to memorize the scent of that room
3801829 oi rika chan is there something youre not telling me
3801830 theres a visa there and a mastercard each having a credit limit of us 50 000 for emergencies and p10 000 cash
3801831 shes only giving this to rika now theyve been together for a month
3801832 remember she only gave rika keys to the flat after a week
3801833 dont worry about a thing rika chan thats nothing to yoshiko im pretty sure she wanted to give you more but i know youre not the receiving type and she knows that too so she gave you the least possible thats bearable to her conscience
3801834 ayaka she just had about a hundred dandelions shipped from japan yesterday
3801835 ishikawas daughter is in the philippines and has made a 10 million us dollar investment in matsuuras company
3801836 sniff rika chan you smell different today sniff sniff have you been sleeping in yoshikos room
3801837 theres a visa there and a mastercard each having a credit limit of us 50 000 for emergencies and p10 000 cash
3801838 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show
3801839 i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid her father aaron spelling created the show
3801840 it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3801841 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it
3801842 personally im very happy and i hope ive made the fans happy
3801843 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events
3801844 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china
3801845 the han and the ethnic minorities including the uighurs are equal members of the big family in china and they are all chinese citizens who enjoy the rights and freedoms allowed them by law
3801846 its a shock i havent heard it from her i would have expected an email
3801847 pauline was getting over the election loss and deciding whether to stay in politics
3801848 i am open to offers and i think that a farmer wants a wife is interesting and some of those people have met their ideal matches and i think thats wonderful i would dearly love to meet someone who i can spend the rest of my life with and have that companionship with
3801849 i think she would be brilliant in the media as a political commentator but not on reality tv that would be a mistake
3801850 or she would be brilliant at hosting maybe something like oprah
3801851 i dont think she would have a problem finding mr right thats why i think it is so bizarre
3801852 made a stabbing motion and i could see his arms cutting
3801853 joe was asking him questions where did he get the phone was he placing ieds was he taliban
3801854 he basically said master sgt newell had a screw loose
3801855 he told me dont worry nothing will come of it
3801856 i have pictures of the bad behavior and an internet connection
3801857 relationships that dont survive the looming departure or return to college and the concomitant expanded or shifted horizons every fall
3801858 i would not be surprised at all if they go below 47 seconds

3801860 in 1994 we had mobile phones that were the size of a brick
3801861 all of life has changed you cannot really compare me to this time just like it would be unfair to compare mark spitz to michael phelps
3801862 i just felt great i came off the turn and just felt like i didnt spend much energy on the way out and just went with all that and just used the extra energy in the second lap and it went quite well
3801863 records dont mean much they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3801864 will edwards scandal teach media that lying about adultery is wrong
3801865 i do not think liberal bias had anything to do with it
3801866 the much derided msm were superfluous their monopoly a faded memory
3801867 we all want this movie to go into production as soon as possible
3801868 its a fast tracked movie lionsgate felt the process was enhanced by having a second team come in and do a script
3801869 fans expect these types of movies to be more true to the source material
3801870 theres no reason there couldnt be a conan movie every two years hes almost like batman hes a dark hero hes a hard hero he has to be badass but we also have to like him
3801871 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
3801872 very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
3801873 you showed the sign where it said stun gun in use and you just change the word gun for bolt and its a meat processing plant
3801874 we want to make sure we got our game plan set
3801875 we want to make sure the entire procedure is laid out all the personnel know what they are supposed to do
3801876 its not like hes 22 years of age and hes never been through it
3801877 hes been traded before he understands the economics of the game he understands clubs choices and how they have to make them
3801878 he doesnt have a no trade clause so he will go where hes told to go for his familys sake with school coming up he hopes thats sooner than later
3801879 cups are hard to pick you think youre picking them when you sign with anaheim but it didnt happen marian hossa probably thinks he picked one with detroit but its hard to repeat as the ducks proved when you get to his schneiders point you want to keep playing that could be done with la winning is a bonus
3801880 if they got mathieu schneider i think they would be better than you think
3801881 all the unexpurgated brain jangling tales of debauchery sex and drugs transcendence and chemical dependence you will ever want to hear
3801882 all the unexpurgated brain jangling tales of debauchery sex and drugs transcendence and chemical dependence you will ever want to hear

3801900 what we need to be doing is all of the above
3801901 the redevelopment will provide an opportunity for true north to showcase its architectural construction and development capabilities in close proximity to i 196
3801902 the structure will also be wired to accommodate future improvements that will include the construction of a green roof and installation of renewable energy sources such as solar panels and micro wind turbines the applicant will be seeking leed certification
3801903 leave you troubles outside so life is disappointing forget it we have no troubles here here life is beautiful the girls are beautiful even the orchestra is beautiful
3801904 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
3801905 the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues

3801909 i think its a little tricky because in the states when they want a latin actress they want someone who looks sort of stereotypically latin
3801910 but i think i can get away with playing a spanish or argentine character i really hope i get to do that someday
3801911 so going from one job to another is really exciting for me after all these years
3801912 im so glad so many people loved the show the way they did and they can still watch the dvds
3801913 a lot of people say thats just the relationship i had with my mother or i wish i had that relationship with my mother
3801914 she was always special from the moment i met her
3801915 i still have family there and a couple of friends
3801916 i dont think its something that people would run into theaters to see
3801917 i think its a very relatable time for a lot of people big changes people trying to start their own lives
3801918 im looking forward to some jobs where things are kind of ready ahead of time and im excited from the get go and theres no tweaking that has to be done on my end
3801919 i definitely dont want to work if were trying to stand for something
3801920 a lot of times charities just want an actor to lend their name i actually want to know everything about what im promoting and be involved directly

3801925 jetzt bin ich zur ckgekommen um beim hsv auf der bank zu sitzen
3801926 der hsv ist seit fast 50 jahren in der bundesliga und hat in dieser zeit fast 100 mal gegen bayern gespielt niemand versteht dass es f r mich interessant ist mit meinem land das viertelfinale bei olympia erreichen zu k nnen das kann ich nicht begreifen
3801927 f r mich ist das aus sportlicher sicht eine logische entscheidung
3801928 jetzt bin ich zur ckgekommen um beim hsv auf der bank zu sitzen
3801929 ich habe juristisch nicht die kraft und die macht allein gegen den hsv zu k mpfen ich spiele nicht f r brasilien oder argentinien sondern f r ein kleines fu ball land unser verband hat angst vor dem hsv
3801930 ich werde am ende daf r bestraft dass ich vor olympia einen kompromiss eingegangen bin ich bin der einzige spieler der zur ckgerufen wurde schalke und werder haben auch wichtige spiele aber rafinha und diego die einfach abgehauen sind spielen weiter bei olympia
3801931 alle haben sich gegen mich gerichtet und auf mich eingetreten ich wurde so dargestellt als h tte ich die abmachung mit dem verein gebrochen das ist falsch
3801932 mir wurde gesagt dass die sportliche situation bei olympia einfluss auf die entscheidung habe jetzt bin ich der verlierer jeder sollte sich fragen ob es l cherlich ist dass ich f r mein land spielen wollte

3801944 titola oggi il settimanale dei cattolici e lennesima puntata di una serie di editoriali durissimi contro lattuale governo pubblicati dalla rivista delle edizioni paoline che hanno fatto scalpore sul resto della stampa italica proprio per la loro puntuta ruvidezza
3801945 non ho un barlume di simpatia per chi parla dal punto di vista del culto organizzato le religioni non sono altro che corporation strumenti di potere politico e finanziario senza relazione con il dio che professano di servire si travestono con costumi bislacchi per dispensare precetti e causare guerre non ho allevato nessuno dei miei figli secondo le tradizioni ebraiche e non so neppure quando cadono le feste sono un antisemita no penso solo che il mondo sarebbe assai migliore senza religione
3801946 come se la ragione di tanti sprechi inefficienze ingiustizie cancrene fosse lassistenzialismo in s lo stato del benessere in s legualitarismo in s e non gli abusi le illegalit luso spregiudicato e clientelare che si fatto in italia di questi strumenti per altro mai posti alla base delle nostre scelte di politica economica
3801947 abbiamo adunque con la chiesa e coi preti noi italiani questo primo obligo di essere diventati sanza religione e cattivi ma ne abbiamo ancora uno maggiore il quale la seconda cagione della rovina nostra questo che la chiesa ha tenuto e tiene questa provincia divisa

3801950 this is not a race issue i have grandchildren the color of barack obama
3801951 you can always tell a hanh property because the grass isnt cut and the snow is not shoveled
3801952 what this program amounts to is what i call demolition by neglect other people from the neighborhood would be here except they werent notified including the owner of the property himself
3801953 571 pays 10 000 in city taxes who will make up for that and the hundreds of thousands lost from the other properties we all will have to
3801954 i met my best friend at edgewood school parent meetings
3801955 but its a magnet school now and most of the spots are taken the authority should work with the school system on making spots available that would help it also would make sense of these scattered site rentals were a step toward home ownership
3801956 i like the fact that scattered site units are being put in the west of the city
3801957 because our area the north east of the city particularly quinnipiac meadows has had more than our fair share
3801958 lots of condo owners come to our management team meetings with issues about the behavior of kids from the area repeatedly weve asked hanh representatives to come to the meetings
3801959 as to social integration please according to the ruling we treat people who move into this housing like anyone else like any neighbor and they can send their kids to school anywhere they want some kids might have special needs having said that i know hanh keeps a special separate list of candidate families for scattered site housing who are screened they know whats expected of them
3801960 first of all of the 183 units there are far fewer actual properties and many of these were built on open land where taxes were not being paid maybe 25 percent im not sure of the figure are in pre existing houses in addition i think there is some kind of pilot payment in lieu of taxes that hud does indeed reimburse the city
3801961 the owner put his place up for sale as soon as the house next to it was purchased by hanh he would have been here but he didnt know about the meeting what are you going to do
3801962 acabo de cumplir 30 a os y lo veo como mi ltimo gran contrato y terminar jugando hasta el fin de mi carrera en chelsea

3801972 toronto based journalist devoted to tracking the international olympic committees host city deliberations

3801974 lots of people are asking how is this going to impact madrid 2016 my reaction is it wont
3801975 notes spanish olympic mens hoops squad ups the racist ante and abc espn disney says oh well
3801976 this report has got nothing to do with the conservative party this is an independent think tank it has charitable status i think this report is complete rubbish it is barmy
3801977 it has produced some good work in the past but this is a very bad report sometimes they come up with good ideas and sometimes they come up with bad ideas this is a bad one
3801978 i think there is a resurgence going on in britains northern cities
3801979 it certainly wont become conservative party policy conservative party policy will continue the good work of regenerating cities right across england including northern cities
3801980 when i think of urban regeneration and city regeneration i think of things like the albert dock in liverpool the canal work in leeds the sage centre in gateshead
3801981 i think the idea that cities cant regenerate themselves they were built for one purpose and cant do another purpose is just nonsense
3801982 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3801983 cameron can distance himself from this all he wants but he needs to explain why his friends have no faith in the north
3801984 this is exactly the sort of vindictive anti northern thinking that led to the widespread industrial decline of swathes of the north under thatcher
3801985 apparently this is once again in vogue in notting hill
3801986 it is important to counter the claims in this report regeneration continues apace in the coastal northern town i represent which has new job opportunities new industry including a new planned shipping terminal and important increases in public spending
3801987 the reality of today is that the regeneration of cities and i can only speak for liverpool but its certainly improving by leaps and bounds
3801988 outperform their competition across a wide range of financial and profitability measures
3801989 what pleases me even more than the money is that this is effectively a public apology
3801990 a lot of wild figures have been bandied about but what i wanted more than money was for people in the street to realise they got it wrong about me
3801991 i would like to buy my council flat where ive lived for over 30 years and i want to put in a new bathroom and kitchen and make a few changes in the garden and of course make sure ive got food on my table and my bills paid
3801992 the best thing is being able to get off the dole im a proud man who has never been afraid of work but nobody in the countless interviews ive attended has wanted to take me on
3801993 im now slowly realising that i have a future after all and thats a great feeling

3802026 i couldnt ask for anything else so far over my first three medal races i think weve done everything that ive wanted to do so far im very happy with how things are going im really happy with how this morning went i actually watched the 200 free on t v and we were just commenting or talking about how my underwaters were pretty good during the race

3802053 so the roller coaster ride in bostons always fun luckily we got the cheers at the end
3802054 nobody should ever score 10 runs in the first inning its embarrassing
3802055 but we know our team is capable of fighting back
3802056 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in the ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought that the game was over
3802057 this was a game that i think potentially could have been a major downer for us
3802058 and we actually turned around and made it actually a great win
3802059 um dia perfeito fiz um grande sacrif cio e me preparei muito hoje foi o dia de mostrar isto

3802061 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3802062 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3802063 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3802064 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3802065 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3802066 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3802067 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3802068 folks cancellaras averaged almost 70 kilometers per hour or in u s lingo about 44 miles per hour en route to the final kilometer
3802069 late in the first quarter natural gas fundamentals started to show improvement for the first time in almost two years
3802070 a cold winter in north america has led to a decline in the storage levels of natural gas compounding this was a diversion of liquefied natural gas away from north america to capitalize on higher prices for natural gas in other parts of the world
3802071 these fundamentals continued to improve during the second quarter natural gas storage levels at the end of the second quarter were significantly lower than the last two years and below the five year average as a result many of the trusts customers have been re evaluating and in a number of cases increasing their 2008 budgets
3802072 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3802073 i couldnt have done it without my coaches friends and family
3802074 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

3802078 the federal government has awarded 85 billion in contracts for work in the iraq theater through 2007 if you included this year the total would exceed 100 billion roughly one of every 5 for the cost of the war in iraq
3802079 the parents are constantly complaining to me but who can i complain to
3802080 why do we need bechtel they have done absolutely nothing
3802081 cronyism is an important factor in our iraqi debacle its not just that reconstruction is much more expensive than it should be
3802082 the really important thing is that cronyism is warping policy by treating contracts as prizes to be handed to their friends administration officials are delaying iraqs recovery with potentially catastrophic consequences
3802083 according to the report the yearly cost of maintaining a single private contractor in iraq can approach half a million dollars far exceeding the annual pay of even the most senior military commanders
3802084 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3802085 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3802090 her education troubled us we know that shes extremely bright shes radicalized we knew that she had been planning or at least involved in the planning of a wide variety of different operations whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the president
3802091 we knew that she was involved with a great deal and we had to bring her into custody
3802092 what she described as units and what we would call cells
3802093 were proud of our role as americas first line of defense against foreign animal diseases
3802094 were equally proud of our safety record not once in our nearly 50 years of operation has an animal pathogen escaped from the island
3802095 we know that he has been involved in terrorist planning with senior al qaeda leaders overseas and has scouted sites across america that might be vulnerable to terrorist attack
3802096 the warrant officer saw and heard siddique fire at least two shots as interpreter 1 tried to wrestle the gun from her no one was hit the warrant officer heard siddique exclaim allah akbar another interpreter interpreter 2 heard siddique yell in english get the f out of here as she fired the rifle
3802097 her medical condition is that she was shot in the abdomen there are stitches that run from the breast plate area down to the belly button area layers and layers of tissue have been sewn sutured we have heard reports that she has lost a kidney we dont know if those are accurate but we are concerned about that there has been intestinal damage part of the intestines we understand have been removed

3802200 washington is out to deny china east land access to either russia the middle east or to the oil and gas fields of the caspian sea
3802201 a close look at the map of eurasia begins to suggest what is so vital for china and therefore for washingtons future domination of eurasia the goal is not only strategic encirclement of russia through a series of nato bases ranging from camp bond steel in kosovo to poland to georgia possibly ukraine and white russia which would enable nato to control energy ties between russia and the european union
3802202 washington policy now encompasses a series of democratic or soft coup projects which would strategically cut china off from access to the vital oil and gas reserves of the caspian including kazakhstan the earlier asian great silk road trade routes went through tashkent in uzbekistan and almaty in kazakhstan for geographically obvious reasons in a region surrounded by major mountain ranges geopolitical control of uzbekistan kyrgyzstan kazakhstan would enable control of any potential pipeline routes between china and central asia just as the encirclement of russia controls pipeline and other ties between it and western europe china india and the mideast
3802203 eurasia is the worlds axial super continent a power that dominated eurasia would exercise decisive influence over two of the worlds three most economically productive regions western europe and east asia a glance at the map also suggests that a country dominant in eurasia would almost automatically control the middle east and africa with eurasia now serving as the decisive geopolitical chessboard it no longer suffices to fashion one policy for europe and another for asia eurasia accounts for 75 of the worlds population 60 of its gnp and 75 of its energy resources collectively eurasias potential power overshadows even americas

3802205 the house is burning down and the president of the united states says this is the way to put out the fire applause and to me at this time there is only one answer to this question and that is to give the president what he demands and says is necessary to meet the situation
3802206 such action is necessary to protect the currency system of the united states
3802207 under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe any transactions in foreign exchange export or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency by any person within the united states
3802208 during any other period of national emergency declared by the president
3802209 require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency or in an amount in money of the united states measured thereby
3802210 no man outside of a lunatic asylum will loan his money today on a farm mortgage
3802211 there is no limitation upon the power of congress it is not circumscribed in any respect whatever it is given full and plenary power to deal with that subject and therefore it is the same as if there were no constitution whatever
3802212 with the full understanding that the government may change its monetary policy at any time and that he must accept whatever the congress says at a particular time shall constitute money
3802213 coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures
3802214 the constitutional power of the congress over the monetary system of the country t hese clauses interfere with the exertion of the power granted to the congress
3802215 obligations cannot be legally avoided by prohibiting the creditor from receiving the thing promised there would be no serious difficulty in estimating the value of 25 8 grains of gold in the currency now in circulation
3802216 for the government to say we have violated our contract but have escaped the consequences through our own statute would be monstrous in matters of contractual obligation the government cannot legislate so as to excuse itself
3802217 secreting or manipulating his assets with the intent to place them beyond the reach of creditors
3802218 will bring us unending humiliation the impending legal and moral chaos is appalling
3802219 that by false interpretations and naked usurpations the government has been made in practice a very widely and almost wholly different thing from what the constitution itself purports to authorize
3802220 has either authorized such a government as we have had or has been powerless to prevent it in either case it is unfit to exist

3802235 i guess more than anything its a little bit annoying that weve been made the scapegoat when you consider how much money we receive relative to the budget for the entire program
3802236 i think our funding comes in at something less than 0 1 per cent of the whole program
3802237 so all of these other larger groups who need money more than we do to travel abroad like ballet and symphonies we become the scapegoat for the cutting in their funding

3802284 it is extremely difficult to appreciate why our hindu friends fail to understand the real nature of islam and hinduism they are not religions in the strict sense of the word but are in fact different and distinct social orders the hindus and muslims belong to two different religious philosophies social customs literature they belong to two different civilizations which are based mainly on conflicting ideas and conceptions their aspects of life and our life are different

3802288 when food and fuel prices surge inflation will shoot up but it is not impossible to bring down inflation even as those prices remain high
3802289 the overall rate of inflation is an average of that from all different sectors so inflation can be kept low as long as price stability in other sectors are maintained

3802315 travelling is no longer considered a luxury with airfares being so affordable these days we expect middle and upper income earners to continue to travel
3802316 aku mengetahui segala apa yang berlaku pada masa lalu anak muda itu satu hari datang kepadaku dan memberitahu apa yang terjadi dan menyarankan supaya aku meninggalkan kota ini karena nyawaku akan tidak selamat dari mu tetapi oleh karena aku menganggap kamu tetap adalah sahabatku aku berharap kepada rahmat dan karunia ilahi setiap hari aku berdoa untuk mu semoga dirimu dibebaskan dari rasa dengki dan hasad terhadapku
3802317 sahabatku ketahuilah bahwa kedengkian laksana api yang membakar dan orang yang mula mula dibakarnya adalah diri insan itu sendiri alangkah baiknya jika dalam masa yang pendek dan singkat di kehidupan dunia ini kita saling kasih mengasihi sehingga kita meninggalkan nama yang baik
3802318 jika manusia kehilangan sahabatnya dia bisa segera melihat sekitarnya kemudian akan mendapatkan sahabat sahabat baru datang dan menghiburkannya akan tetapi apabila hati manusia kehilangan kedamaiannya di manakah dia akan menemukannya bagaimanakah dia akan bisa memperolehnya kembali tanpa ketulusan dan kejujuran mungkinkah semua itu akan bisa tercapai untuk sementara mungkin jawabannya bisa namun itu hanya untuk sementara selanjutnya hanya waktu yang bisa menjawab semuanya
3802319 after years of violence we finally realized that al qaeda was only here to destroy our city
3802320 the relationship between the sos and isf in samarra is the best in all of iraq
3802321 from the beginning the americans were very serious about it
3802322 with all due respect to the coalition forces it was the sahwa movement that brought the most security to the city today is the safest samarra has been since al qaeda arrived in 2004
3802323 please pass along a message to your government from me tell them to do everything they can to get my boys hired into the iraqi security forces if they dont get hired they will go back to being jobless and we go back to the starting point

3802326 kamu belum mampu untuk bisa semulia itu hati dan pikiranmu masih terlalu rumit emosimu masih jauh dari stabil tidak pantas kamu bersembunyi di balik satu kata yang sangat keramat itu
3802327 tapi aku tidak mau tejebak dalam kata pasrah terlalu sakit rasanya kalau aku menggunakan kata itu kata pasrah itu terlalu mencerminkan ketidak berdayaanku dan itu bukan diriku banget aku tidak selemah itu
3802328 kalau kamu tidak mau terlihat lemah kamu harus mengenal dan memahami permasalahannya terlebih dahulu coba kamu terlusuri apa sebetulnya akar permasalahan yang membuat jiwamu menjadi labil dan tertekan seperti itu aku yakin semua beban itu pasti bukan berawal dari orang lain
3802329 tapi bagaimana caranya aku bisa mengetahui akar permasalahannya sementara aku sendiri tidak merasa bersalah apa yang aku lakukan adalah wajar dan selalu ada alasan mengapa aku bersikap demikian terhadap orang lain orang lainnya saja yang memang tidak bisa mengerti apa yang aku mau
3802330 itulah kesalahan kamu yang paling fatal kamu selalu menyandarkan harapan terhadap orang lain sementara apakah kamu sendiri mengerti apa sebetulnya yang kamu mau
3802331 aku ya jelas tahu lah yang aku mau tanpa aku jelaskan secara rinci seharusnya orang lain bisa mengerti apa yang aku mau seperti halnya aku selalu berusaha mengerti apa yang mereka mau
3802332 gotcha sekarang aku tanya apakah kamu sendiri benar benar sudah tahu apa yang sebetulnya mereka mau
3802333 nah kamu sendiri nggak yakin kan dengan perasaan kamu sendiri bagaimana orang lain bisa mengerti apa yang kamu inginkan kalau kamu tidak pernah memberitahukan kepada mereka ketajaman perasaan manusia itu berbeda beda ada yang bisa membaca hanya melalui kata kata dan gerak tubuh kita ada yang sebaliknya sulit untuk mencerna karena terlalu banyaknya beban dalam dirinya sendiri yang belum sanggup untuk dia selesaikan seperti yang terjadi pada dirimu saat ini
3802334 apabila kamu sendiri sudah mengenal dan memahami akar permasalahannya ini berarti kamu sudah menyadari siapa diri kamu yang sesungguhnya dan apa sebetulnya yang kamu inginkan pada saat seperti ini aku yakin kamu akan bisa memahami apa yang sebenarnya dipikirkan oleh orang yang selama ini kamu anggap tidak peka pada apa yang kamu inginkan dan selanjutnya kamu akan bisa memaklumi ketidak pekaan mereka tersebut

3802341 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease fire
3802342 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3802343 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces who have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3802344 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected
3802345 all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
3802346 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis

3802365 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3802366 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3802367 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3802368 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3802369 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3802370 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3802371 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3802372 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

3802374 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3802375 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3802382 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3802383 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3802384 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions

3802390 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3802391 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3802392 they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
3802393 in contact with afghan authorities to confirm reports that two canadian aid workers were killed today
3802394 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3802395 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most

3802402 aggression against a small country in europe not be passed over in silence or with meaningless statements equating the victims with the victimizers

3802404 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow people hopefully to face their own lives completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with existence
3802405 when youre looking at yourself you see all your flaws and you think of them as being unattractive but when you look at someone else its the flaws that make them so beautiful
3802406 damn lucky smiles i certainly know that i have a chance thats one in a million and a job thats sort of disposable and i feel lucky that i havent been found out
3802407 i constantly recognise my incredible luck and am reminded of it every day when i talk to friends who said that they waited three hours for a casting call and they got to the door and it was shut in their face i was in the right place at the right time
3802408 no my head is screwed on pretty good and i just take it as it comes i suppose
3802409 i think it depends on where you come from and what kind of family you come from

3802411 oh definitely i mean thats a given women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry
3802412 it was fantastic to not only live with that music i love every day but to work with such wonderful musicians
3802413 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show
3802414 i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid her father aaron spelling created the show
3802415 it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3802416 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it

3802475 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3802476 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3802477 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together

3802479 we think crysis warhead is going to offer a tremendous experience to a wide range of gamers
3802480 fans of crysis are going to enjoy more of the open ended gameplay cutting edge visuals and huge epic battles from the first game while also finally finding out what kind of havoc psycho was wreaking on the other side of the island

3802482 the other religious groups did not have a universal mission and the holy war was not a religious duty for them save only for purposes of defence islam is under obligation to gain power over other nations
3802483 a religious war with those who are unbelievers in the mission of muhammad the prophet it is an incumbent religious duty established in the quran and in the traditions as a divine institution and enjoined especially for the purpose of advancing islam
3802484 the other religious groups did not have a universal mission and the holy war was not a religious duty for them save only for purposes of defence islam is under obligation to gain power over other nations
3802485 wherever an islamic community exists it has a god given right to step forward and take control of the political authority when god restrained muslims from jihad for a certain period it was a question of strategy rather than of principle
3802486 brings out with simplicity clarity and precision the quranic philosophy on the application of the military force within the context of the totality that is jihad
3802487 the prophets operations are an integral and inseparable part of the divine message revealed to us in the quran the war he planned and carried out was total to the infinite degree it was waged on all fronts internal and external political and diplomatic spiritual and psychological economic and military
3802488 the aggressor was always met and destroyed in his own territory
3802489 the quranic military strategy thus enjoins us to prepare ourselves for war to the utmost in order to strike terror into the heart of the enemy
3802490 terror struck into the hearts of the enemy is not only a means it is the end in itself once a condition of terror into the opponents heart is obtained hardly anything is left to be achieved terror is not a means of imposing decision upon the enemy it is the decision we wish to impose upon him
3802491 against them non muslims make ready your strength to the utmost of your power including steeds of war to strike terror into the hearts of the enemies of allah and your enemies
3802492 thats why we buy back to school clothes at such and such store so she can feel good about herself

3802495 you wouldnt want other students making fun of your kid would you
3802496 there is a little doubt that the poker den has a cult following clips from the first two games are all over the internet viewers love the fine line between poker genius and complete madness it seems to bring out in the worlds top pros the den is a small intimate venue so we just hope it is big enough to accommodate their egos
3802497 the poker den has come such a long way since we started it back in the summer of 2005

3802503 if he resigns now it will be taken that he ran away from a charge sheet
3802504 it is increasingly difficult to demonstrate that buying a renewable electricity tariff is offering additional carbon emissions reductions
3802505 businesses signed up to green tariffs based on the evidence available at the time but their choices have been producing only limited additional renewable generation capacity
3802506 many companies bought these tariffs in good faith but there are no guarantees that they actually save carbon they didnt pay much of a premium for the carbon savings they could claim in their marketing statements so they have basically been given a free ride
3802507 theyre worried about being ranked badly nobody wants to come bottom of a table of their peers
3802508 this is a serious problem for a number of companies who have followed the governments guidelines and gone out and purchased green electricity and are now being told that green source is no longer valid
3802509 the gravest breach of the commitments of the council of europe
3802510 the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues
3802511 i see no point in us getting lost in a long debate today about responsibility for and origins of the escalation of the last few days
3802512 you can decide to make strong statements with one sided condemnations or you can look to the future and take a real role in stabilizing the situation

3802534 os estados unidos est o do lado do governo democraticamente eleito na ge rgia e insistem que a soberania e a integridade territorial da ge rgia sejam respeitadas
3802535 i know the proof in the hermitian case needs work
3802536 specific requirements are in place to assure there is a lessening or even a removal of potential for damage in future storms
3802537 there are many approaches to mitigating a storm damaged structure
3802538 they include elevation and relocation of properties or simple things such as raising hot water heaters washers and dryers among other things
3802539 we urge all rebuilding contractors and property owners to visit their local permitting offices and obtain the necessary permits before beginning the rebuilding process
3802540 prior planning and good information will produce a structure that would be better able to withstand the next major disaster and will keep the property owner from having to undergo the costly process of getting the proper permits
3802541 wills you over with its charm its sense of mischief and its pure scottishness
3802542 now if youll excuse me i have to go pick out a vice president
3802543 john needs to be the deliberate experienced veteran and not the grumpy old man
3802544 feels no guilt about encouraging her supporters to mess up obamas big moment thus undermining his odds of beating john mccain and improving her odds of being the nominee in 2012
3802545 our voters and edwards voters were the same people they were older pro union
3802546 we appreciate the concern of the group that wal mart and coca cola is financing
3802547 its clearly in retaliation for having voted the union in
3802548 once you file and an election day is set the company then goes into war mode
3802549 they have captive audience meetings where they bring everybody together and they say its not in their best interest to have a union
3802550 when your employer says that and thats the same person who signs your check it has a very harmful effect on free speech
3802551 theyll make all kinds of threats theyll find out if you owe money for example and theyll play on that
3802552 theyll actually have a campaign for every single person involved now these ads on tv talk about democratic rights well where the hell are the democratic rights in this process they dont exist those are fascist elections thats what they are
3802553 if you read the proposed law it would be illegal to have a traditional private election once the union organizers convinced enough workers a simple majority to sign a public card the union bosses are the ones who will decide if there is a private ballot workers votes will be made public to their employer union organizers and co workers
3802554 i would be surprised if we can find enough in further savings to cut the rate
3802555 avoid attempting to mediate disputes which would have only a minor effect on interstate commerce
3802556 during this period it is believed that employers often hire anti union consultants terminate pro union employees and conduct captive audience meetings where employees are exposed to the employers views against representation
3802557 i would be surprised if we can find enough in further savings to cut the rate

3802562 im so incredibly sorry i hope we can still have a magical evening
3802563 all cases of bulimia all cases of anorexia and all cases of cosmetic surgery in all women is a direct result of the fact that all men when they reach a certain age always look to dump their wives for younger women
3802564 you cant make these blanket sweeping generalizations you cant say all men all women all cases
3802565 middle aged men obsessed with youth can afford lifesize matchbox cars preferably v8 two seaters only two seats since the kids have grown up and out and thinking hes the first to master the subtle art of the combover hes surging with enough self confidence to kick his wife of 30 odd years to the curb purely as a goodwill gesture of course so she wont have to ride hump as he picks up his newly acquired lycra clad ab crunching breast implanted 20 something trophy girlfriend
3802566 because women have programmed men to chase after younger women
3802567 but then joy of all joys we actually do become friends because im the one left holding back her hair while she finishes throwing up not cause im so chivalrous but because deep down i think shes gonna tell me to brush away the rest of that vomit and show her what its like to really be kissed
3802568 but college does and its freshman year again and since were such good friends now shes calling to tell me how much sex shes having with upperclassmen while im still going home on weekends for the sadie hawkins dance so excuse me if i have little empathy or regard for your dissertation on middle aged mens infatuations with younger women im kirk cameron and thats one to grow on
3802569 that was the most overly macho testosterone laden psychobabble ive ever witnessed in my life

3802604 an emerging theme for threats in july seems to be new variations on old attack methods
3802605 following on from june web based malware continues to be a treacherous threat and organizations would be smart to build their web security defenses in preparation for what could be on the horizon
3802606 the root cause is unvalidated input which can lead to sql injection among other things including cross site scripting passive manipulation and other things
3802607 the point is that there are tools out there such that if you point them to a web site they will try injecting sql into every web site they can find theres even a firefox extension
3802608 this is just one of several tools designed for site designers to scan their own web sites but thats part of the problem its freely available and anyone can use it the bad guys can use it just as easily as the developers themselves
3802609 developers are under pressure to release software that fulfills functional requirements security requirements are generally not part of functional requirements the no 1 rule is to release the software that does its job by this date if you cant do anything else do that
3802610 the way wed like to see development going is youd like to have a security guy involved from the beginning youd like to have developers knowing or caring enough or having time enough to test these things themselves
3802611 google sites is yet another way that spammers have programmatically defeated captcha completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart mechanisms a validation technique that is designed to defend against automated sign up tools frequently used by spammers by requiring the user to enter a string of letters
3802612 while google sites spam accounts for only 1 percent of all spam currently we anticipate that this techniques popularity will rival that of its predecessors google docs calendar and pages spam if this is the case then we may see spam levels increase in the months ahead
3802613 no evil thats inflicted more pain and more suffering than racism and its something we in the labor movement have a special responsibility to challenge

3802666 ive gone to a driving range before and hit golf balls because i saw tiger woods doing it on tv

3802668 in the swimming world i will be known for the next four years

3802671 id like to inform you i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd and has zero to do with the movie i performed in
3802672 my best friends girl is the best funniest film ive done yet its got a terrific cast
3802673 kate hudson alec baldwin jason biggs and myself really kicked the funny around this movie showcases our talents accordingly as it expands on them
3802674 whoever photoshopped our poster must have done so at taser point with 3 minutes to fulfill their hostage takers deranged obligations
3802675 my character apparently has fallen in love with a strand of kate hudsons hair kates mannequin is desperately in love with the inside of my right ear while jason is half stunned half corsage

3802677 its no secret that im more rugged facially due to a drunken visit by the teen acne fairy but according to this poster ive got perfect porcelain flesh

3802688 a senior bush administration counterterrorism official said tuesday that an analysis of public statements by al qaeda in the past year shows that nearly half the verbiage is devoted to justifying the groups legitimacy

3802813 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3802814 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3802815 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
3802816 it will be more direct more about life and have more social commentary in there
3802817 thats where its kind of heading now it wont be a boohoo record about oh we got famous but a commentary on how the world is now
3802818 from what ive seen after going back and looking at tapes its been very fair
3802819 even our losses have been very fair there are some things theyve missed but thats the human element all five are seeing something a little different because of where theyre sitting in the ring
3802820 when i sit in the corner im thinking damn theyre cheatin us to myself then i go back and see the tape at night and its man the guy really did score its all according to where you sit
3802821 when they came up with computer scoring it really did not help us
3802822 most of our coaches train their kids with a professional style and professional style does not do well internationally
3802823 everythings good everythings fine were going to continue working hard until we get that gold medal from now on im going in the ring to have fun
3802824 look aidan uncle drew and aunt kate made a donation to the zoo in your name
3802825 no with their money they donated the money in your name
3802826 what wait i dont understand animals cant even use money why did they do that
3802827 mom two more couples just left the dance floor look
3802828 they have been married forever 57 billion years or something waawhooooo they won look they get a prize i hope i get a prize for being married for that many years too
3802829 but i didnt get to kiss uncle drew gooood byeeeeeehhhhh
3802830 im so hot in this tuxedo i think im going to diiiiiiieeee
3802831 i didnt get to do anything all day long only a wedding thats it
3802832 the wedding prize the solar car even though i have to wait until 9 or 3 to use it
3802833 no the book said between 9 and 3 are the best times to use it thats when it will work the best because thats when it tends to be the most sunny
3802834 oh so if its like 8 00 but its sunny i can still use it right
3802835 you cant put ethanol in a pipeline and even your car needs some adjustments to it whereas the product were making is going into the existing system and thats a big difference

3802862 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3802863 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3802864 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3802865 i feel for sure ive made 100 per cent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3802866 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3802867 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there
3802868 its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought its a great day for the club frank and english football
3802869 he has agreed and signed a new five year contract
3802870 it allows us to kill all the speculation of the last 18 months and allows us to concentrate on the really important thing next season

3802874 people are dying to have waterfront development here you know to reconnect to that water so its been widely accepted more so than we thought it would be
3802875 a lot of communities around the country now are changing from an industrial use of their waters into a more residential business type economic development and ive seen tremendous results from that
3802876 it depends on what costs it brings to us and everything but i think as long as it makes this part of town nicer im all for it depending on all the little details
3802877 one thing technology promises us is speed acceleration more of everything in less time all we are doing here is creating a physical and biological interruption to this flow and we hope that by doing this we might also interrupt for one small moment our understanding of communication allowing us to explore notions of time it may even enable us to take time rather than lose it

3802959 what are the essential natures of minds and mental processes
3802960 how many distinct kinds of entities do we need to posit the existence of in order to explain mental phenomena
3802961 what does it mean to say that a mental state is a conscious one is conscious used in the same way always and therefore picks out a unitary phenomena or is it used in bewilderingly differing kinds of ways and therefore is unlikely to pick out any single property in the world
3802962 if i were him then i wouldnt have done it like that

3802980 psychology as a behaviorist views it is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science its theoretical goal is prediction and control
3802981 to predict given the stimulus what reaction will take place or given the reaction state what the situation or stimulus is that has caused the reaction
3802982 all psychological statements that are meaningful are translatable into statements that do not involve psychological concepts
3802983 everything important in psychology can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice point in a maze
3802984 are derived from contingencies which specify discriminative stimuli responses and consequences
3802985 to inner states is not that they do not exist but that they are not relevant in a functional analysis
3802986 whatever happens when we inspect a public stimulus is in every respect similar to what happens when we introspect a private one
3802987 it is in the nature of an experimental analysis of human behavior that it should strip away the functions previously assigned to autonomous man and transfer them one by one to the controlling environment
3802988 people just naturally do the things they need to do to maintain themselves and treat each other well and they just naturally do a hundred other things they enjoy doing because they do not have to do them
3802989 the essential or defining feature of any type of mental states is the set of causal relations it bears to bodily behavior
3802990 while staying wholly inside an animal eventually we must turn to forces operating upon the organism from without
3802991 unless there is a weak spot in our causal chain so that the second neurological link is not lawfully determined by the first environmental stimuli or the third behavior by the second the first and third links must be lawfully related
3802992 valid information about the second link may throw light on this relationship but can in no way alter it
3802993 is not empty and it cannot adequately be treated simply as a black box
3802994 something is done today which affects the behavior of the organism tomorrow
3802995 we now have an enormous collection of experimental data which it would seem simply cannot be made sense of unless we postulate something like
3802996 from the very moment that the experience of whose qualia they are
3802997 the variables of which human behavior is a function lie in the environment
3802998 contemporary connectionism are the new parallel distributed processing models cognitive or associationist
3802999 there is no convincing evidence for operant or classical conditioning in adult humans
3803000 the causal potency of qualia its nature and its source
3803001 the role of information about the response outcome relationship in instrumental discrimination learning

3803005 the area i live in is totally infested with raccoons
3803006 they run along the fences theyre in the garbage theyre in your yard they try to dig up plants
3803007 the most common cause is wildlife urinating and getting into stagnant water and then a dog coming along and drinking that water
3803008 it can actually go in and affect the liver and kidney
3803009 what we found is that the liver enzymes were right off the scale
3803010 you have to look at the risk factor of your own dog and decide whether you want to vaccinate or not or keep the animal on a leash so you know what theyre getting into
3803011 these are not tame animals theyre not supposed to be here in the numbers that they are
3803012 what a staff person would do is offer advice depending upon the information that they receive
3803013 our first advice always is to try to make it as easy as possible for animals and humans to co habitat
3803014 if they really want the animal removed then people have the choice of trapping the animals themselves

3803053 so how is felix a compliment he only runs 2 sec faster than barber and doesnt catch even close to as many passes
3803054 he is generally brought down on the initial hit when operating in a crowd he had just 22 runs on which the opposition needed more than one defender to take him down on 133 attempts in 2007
3803055 durability might be a concern with his lack of ideal size but he shows good power and leg drive to break tackles and is not a liability taking the ball up the middle
3803056 when he keeps his pads down generally does he uses his balance and leg drive to break through initial tackles
3803057 were going to win we decided to sue after the last meeting were trying to take the high ground here every time we try to do that city council president charlie mallow comes in with broad general statements without any basis weve told our attorey it has to be filed before the next council meeting

3803074 martha jones ex time traveller and now working as a doctor for a un task force has been called to cern the worlds largest particle physics laboratory in geneva where theyre about to activate the large hadron collider lhc
3803075 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france once activated the collider will fire beams of protons together recreating conditions a billionth of a second after the big bang and potentially allowing the human race a greater insight into what the universe is made of
3803076 but so much could go wrong it could open a gateway to a parallel dimension or create a black hole and now voices from the past are calling out to people and scientists have started to disappear
3803077 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
3803078 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
3803079 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick

3803085 now that the challenges of rebuilding failed states and shattered societies are central to u s foreign policy his coats lively and fascinating account of one effort at national reconstruction is as timely as it is informative

3803088 ive always thought bodybuilding was a very apt vehicle to explore the idea of self improvement if my views have changed recently with regard to the possibilities of bodybuilding it is only in relation to the alarming rate of growth my man boobs have undergone the last couple of years ive started doing flies and push ups to firm them up so i dont look like a lactating gorilla
3803089 he asked me with o j mayos departure if i could guarantee him a spot in the starting lineup
3803090 i told him angelo youre going to play a bunch and could start on 95 of the teams in the country but i cant guarantee you that i dont think it would be fair to our new players coming in to guarantee anything to anybody hes made his choice and is going to explore his options

3803103 he was performing one of the more nobler duties of the military in afghanistan he did a lot of good for the local afghanis

3803107 puerto rican heartthrob is living each day like my last cause it might be
3803108 i say what is on my mind and the truth no matter what
3803109 i live life like i want to so i am not one of those guys that says damn i wish i did that
3803110 there was a certain charm about it its hard to explain but its something he pulled off
3803111 i am a simple guy with simple interests and a complicated brain
3803112 had the biggest heart and the most beautiful soul of anyone i have known words cant even begin to describe how generous he was
3803113 it was my surprise after having surgery and for being as he put it the strongest woman he has ever known besides his mama it is very much ironic to receive the flowers on the same day i find out but in his own fashion that was him
3803114 i cant imagine him going out in a better way he was a true warrior in every sense of the word
3803115 his uncanny ability to make me smile while telling me the brutal truth he would tell me the truth in such a way that you couldnt help but smile even if it hurt a little bit
3803116 my most sincere condolences go out to the family of our lost service member our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected and impacted by airman yelners death

3803118 special forces and that sgt budeyskys hebrew name was baruch ben mayer northwestern university reported that steven budeysky class of 2001 died on may 19th but the year was uncertain
3803119 perhaps because of what happened to jews in the holocaust americans today have a mistaken idea of the role american jews have played and continue to play in our countrys armed forces
3803120 i do think the american player overall is better at this stage than he was about 10 years ago
3803121 as far as the standout player i think youre getting the same amount
3803122 the pool of the middle of the road player who can do enough to be successful at that top level for a couple of years has gotten much deeper
3803123 but its the players who can come into the league the first year be starters have an impact we have to do a better job of developing those players
3803124 it comes down to this theres so much more emphasis put on results than whats right for development
3803125 when the only way they judge the play is if you score if you make a save or the end result thats not right
3803126 there should be recognition of a kid trying to control a ball or trying to pass the ball or trying to make some move even if it doesnt work
3803127 the first thing is its me and the ball the second is its me and the ball and wheres the opponent then its its me and the ball and wheres the opponent wheres my teammate
3803128 i dont think we should be looking at playing state championships when theyre 8 9 or 10 years old but when they get 11 12 yeah they become competitive
3803129 and bigger faster stronger wins sometimes at those age groups so you have to take that into account but what youre really trying to do is see how the individual players are adapting and interpreting the information that the game gives them and how they are becoming better at that and thats what i always told parents
3803130 im not going to promise you any championships but were going to win games were gonna have some fun were going to play good soccer and try and play soccer the way i want to play soccer and they way it should be played if you want to win titles then this aint the team for you
3803131 at every age level you might create chances but you dont score the goals you might need to win the game
3803132 are you possessing the ball are you playing as a unit are the players having fun are they becoming more skillful are they able to understand each others movements in relation to each other do they have individual skill and flair those are the things that basically youre looking for

3803145 no more gas based power plant to be set up in the country
3803146 so the present government has to think about gas import
3803147 even weve accepted the price that bapex offered for its new gas field
3803148 we should go for multiple approaches in resolving the countrys power and energy crises
3803149 were going to hand over power to an elected political government so they should take experts to deal with the matters
3803150 jeg er ikke anmelder af hjerte jeg er en kunstner som tager en time out for at blive anmelder
3803151 to meet the 300 times more demand for electricity we will require to invest up to 10 billion over the next 20 years
3803152 the present per capita electricity consumption is 117 kwh kilo watts hour nearly 6 percent of the world average
3803153 over the next 20 years as we plan to become a middle income country by raising our economic growth to at least 10 percent from 6 percent now the country will have to produce about 13 000 mw
3803154 a policy is being finalised to give private sector full support which will enable them to invest even in the state run power plants and make then more productive
3803155 because of excessive revisions and inputs from a wide number of people the draft policy now sounds more like a law than a policy
3803156 and this was exactly the observation of the law ministry about the policy when the energy ministry sent the draft to the law ministry a few months back
3803157 that is why the law ministry observed that instead of such a policy the government should work on several laws instead of just one
3803158 once the government acquires a piece of land it cant be returned to the original owner the government can however restore the land and allow its agricultural use
3803159 there has been no study by any group about such an open pit mine in barapukuria how can this committee suggest this besides who would invest for a test case if there is no guarantee of any profit
3803160 again technically you also need bigger land for an open pit mine the barapukuria mine area has a power plant and other structures then is this a feasible idea or just an undue idea
3803161 coal can be a useful and effective alternative source of energy to ensure the countrys future energy security and help developing the national economy
3803162 but to utilize the countrys coal reserve potentials a bold decision and its immediate implementation are necessary
3803163 images of these packs stuffed in jeans pockets can give kids the wrong idea it turns this into an alcoholic candy bar
3803164 these shots are perfect to take with you tailgating at concerts to sporting events on vacations on a plane or on your next camping or boat trip
3803165 we are tidying up what might be considered controversial we are trying to turn this into a positive product
3803166 combining vodka with raspberry drinks and calling it a party in a pouch who are they appealing to this isnt the kind of thing adults drink
3803167 we think a cocktail in a pocket fulfills a real niche out there
3803168 you can have four of the cocktails for example and not be in trouble
3803169 we are aware of the complaints but we have limited jurisdiction on what we can do about it
3803170 any alcohol product that has marketing characteristics that would appeal to youths is something that we are concerned about
3803171 he had decided to end the campaign after restoring security for russian citizens and peacekeepers in south ossetia
3803172 just as you wouldnt expect to see a tobacco ad on a kids site or show there shouldnt be junk food ads there either
3803173 while there are some rules for tv there are no rules when you move online
3803174 we dont want to reduce junk food advertising to kids on tv and then find that it has just moved to another platform
3803175 with social networking marketers are getting the kids to create the ads and share them with their friends
3803176 it is incredibly sticky and it is viral regulators need to understand that
3803177 the report finds that although there is room for improvement the food and beverage industries have made significant progress
3803178 the cost of reaching and engaging a lot more kids is a lot less than the cost of what it is to buy a 30 second television ad
3803179 they are using a powerful arsenal of tools to target children and adolescents so they can engage in these unhealthy eating behaviors
3803180 to show that the government needs to regulate this advertising to improve childrens diets would be pretty tough
3803181 we think that companies can act on a self regulatory basis much more quickly than the government can
3803182 listen up fellow parents when we point a collective finger three more are pointing right back at us
3803183 when will we stop playing the victim and start taking personal responsibility for our kids health and eating habits
3803184 it was probably us that encouraged georgias president to be so over confident
3803185 the world is a dangerous place and we need someone strong
3803186 this year politics of fear are not working the way they used to
3803187 i felt much more attracted to women and just felt like a man but i knew i was not lesbian
3803188 while this may be the line which the muslim brotherhood would like us to accept without debate the reality is that a plurality if not a majority of muslims refuse to subscribe to the religio political collectivism of the muslim brotherhood and the now archaic concept of the islamic state
3803189 she gave her daughter into the hands of the devil and cursed her for eternity
3803190 discard is a terrible practice in addition to the moral aspects of this sheer waste of food discards lead to unrecorded catches which lead to incorrect fisheries statistics which again disrupt the basis for scientific assessments of stocks and scientific advice on management
3803191 the best scientific advice is that we shouldnt be fishing for cod at all because stocks have been so depleted in the north sea and yet here we have tons of fish being dumped overboard
3803192 discard is happening all the time but normally it takes place at sea where nobody can see what is happening this incident has to be multiplied many many times to get an idea of the scale of the waste
3803193 the fishermen would say it happens because quotas are too small and they have to throw fish back but you would have to be insane to agree with that argument
3803194 it is morally wrong and its just p ing in your own bed this has been illegal in norway since the eighties and the boat would have been arrested had it done it in the norwegian sector it is just calculated environmental criminality the whole thing is very provocative disappointing and shocking
3803195 the system forces fishermen to go to a place they are unfamiliar with to seek the fish they have quotas for unfortunately in this case they landed a quantity of saithe which they didnt have a quota for
3803196 if they had dumped it there and then they would have been breaking norwegian laws and if they had landed it back in the uk they would have been fined
3803197 they did the only think they could do which was to steam 100 miles away wasting time and fuel to an area where they hoped to find the type of fish they are entitled to catch and where they could legally dump the saithe
3803198 this is a horrible indictment of the system fishermen have to operate under these are young men under massive pressures trying to make a living no fisherman wants to dump fish his job is to find fish for people to eat not to see it thrown over the side
3803199 throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see but there is no easy answer
3803200 uk fishermen have shown that they are committed to finding new ways of protecting vulnerable stocks and the european union has backed a uk action plan designed to reduce the amount of discards
3803201 never tells consumers how the tuna was caught imposes no restrictions on fads for the majority of their catch and no support for marine reserves and more widespread use of tuna from stocks under specific threat
3803202 thousands of turtles and sharks are killed every year while catching tuna to be put in tins and john west the biggest tinned tuna seller in the uk is currently the worst supplier of the lot
3803203 whilst the label on the tin may say dolphin friendly some tuna fishing methods can be hugely destructive
3803204 john west must stop selling tuna caught in this way and if the whole fishing industry is going to be truly sustainable then they must support the introduction of large scale marine reserves across the worlds oceans
3803205 the problem is that people dont really know how it starts but once it does it can kill all of your fish really quickly
3803206 this part of the publishing world has not been getting the respect that areas such as internet content have been getting
3803207 people see the trade magazine and trade show models as kind of old school with advertisers and exhibitors hunting out new ways to promote their companies on the web
3803208 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
3803209 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3803210 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3803211 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3803212 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3803213 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3803214 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3803215 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3803216 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3803217 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3803218 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3803219 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3803220 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3803221 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3803222 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3803223 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3803224 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3803225 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3803226 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3803227 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3803228 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3803229 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3803230 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3803231 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3803232 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3803233 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3803234 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3803235 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3803236 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3803237 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3803238 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3803239 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

3803253 the invitation means that pyongyang is beginning to have non political talks with western society
3803254 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3803255 we have said that the sanctions should not be lifted without the return of all abductees and our stance will never change
3803256 ill never trust north korea at all i cannot be confident without seeing results
3803257 look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time make the right moves on the nuclear issue
3803258 this is an achievement thanks to fukudas talks oriented policies
3803259 we have to monitor details of their action and consider if it will lead to what people can accept
3803260 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims

3803266 el deber de todo revolucionario es hacer la revoluci n
3803267 ese movimiento en cuba no se sinti era visto como un problema de los j venes de europa sobre todo en francia en contra del poder instituido nosotros viv amos oyendo estaciones extranjeras para poder escuchar la m sica que nos gustaba hab a una forma muy r gida de pensar muy intolerante
3803268 fue muy diferente de lo que suced a en estados unidos y en europa fue un movimiento liderado por intelectuales profesores y artistas por un breve momento experiment un poco de libertad as que el 68 fue muy importante pod amos vivir libremente pero dur muy poco despu s volvimos a los antiguos m todos estalinistas
3803269 la mayor a apoy los nuevos aires y abraz la revoluci n porque cre an que se trataba de un verdadero cambio para mejor cuando la gente recuerda esa poca la suelen asociar con la guardia roja y una serie de atrocidades cometidas en su nombre
3803270 1968 es importante porque hasta cierto punto resume lo que fue la d cada de los 60 una d cada de cambio cambia el papel de la mujer en estas sociedades avanzadas el tema racial que fue siempre un tema candente lleva a la aprobaci n de dos leyes important simas
3803271 hay que recordar que nosotros cre amos ser un movimiento pol tico no un movimiento cultural por lo tanto si se observa el 68 como un movimiento pol tico hay que decir que fuimos derrotados pero si los vemos desde el punto de vista de la historia de la cultura hemos obtenido una victoria enorme
3803272 me rebelaba contra la represi n y la antidemocracia m xico viv a un r gimen represivo que negaba el ejercicio de las m s elementales libertades el derecho de manifestaci n de asociaci n y de prensa el movimiento de 1968 fue en favor de las libertades democr ticas y por la libertad de los presos pol ticos
3803273 para los que vivimos en esos a os el mundo era una responsabilidad para transformar mejorar y volverlo solidario yo so aba con un mundo mejor donde cada ser humano podr a hacer de su vida una aventura donde hubiera lugar para la poes a la m sica el trabajo el placer y el descanso
3803274 fuimos la primera generaci n en rebelarse contra la sociedad de consumo porque no nos daba una sensaci n de verdad sent amos que no pod amos confiar en esa sociedad y buscamos ideales y los ideales los encontramos en la calle cuando tom bamos una piedra o hac amos un cocktail molotov
3803275 el episodio m s terrible fue en agosto cuando las tropas sovi ticas entraron en praga y aniquilaron el movimiento conocido como la primavera de praga en mosc siete u ocho disidentes se manifestaron en la plaza roja y en pocos minutos fueron rodeados por la kgb y enviados a prisi n

3803291 destapan los techos de basura huele a gato por toda la ciudad hay gatos con problemas de piel d biles que entran y salen de viejos edificios vacantes
3803292 para m dejar que estos gatos deambulen por la ciudad es en s un acto de crueldad hacia los animales
3803293 los gatos son algo muy bueno para el viejo san juan
3803294 no le hacen mal a nadie y la mayor a de los visitantes quedan encantados con ellos
3803295 im just curious what if you have a sense of something
3803296 well i often have these feelings which turn out to be false so in this case where i cant prove it one way or the other im inclined to doubt my feeling until other evidence shows up
3803297 well some guy in a white coat probably knows how it works
3803298 take ufos for example they are most likely not alien ships but does it stand to reason that they arent more than mere airplanes
3803299 finally an often overlooked fact about ufo sightings is that they never occurred until the advent of science fiction literature it was after science fiction popularized the image of a flying saucer that sightings became common
3803300 no it doesnt mean that but the question is irrelevant and youre a cretin for asking
3803301 the burden isnt on us to show that something exists
3803302 the burden isnt on us to show that something doesnt exist
3803303 i did and the rest of the account i didnt i it was unidentified flying object okay its like its unidentified i saw something
3803304 i did and the rest of the account i didnt i it was unidentified flying object okay its like its unidentified i saw something
3803305 dont worry thats just a bunch of neurons firing creating your experience
3803306 and if you do what do you say to them when they are scared and confused about life
3803307 there is a supernatural being who is looking out for you
3803308 the whole issue is about the relationship between the handicap and the task to be performed
3803309 its not immediately obvious how mere belief in god conflicts with accepting evolution
3803310 im mad as hell and im not going to take this any more
3803311 religion functions as a mental handicap to the pursuit of a career in science
3803312 do you think it incompatible to believe in god and evolution
3803313 do you think it incompatible to believe in god and evolution
3803314 provide a coherent reasoned justification for christianity given the facts of evolution
3803315 cue the pleas for epistemological relativism in the face of insurmountable pwnage
3803316 provide a coherent reasoned justification for christianity given the facts of evolution
3803317 there are people here who speak of the way the mind works
3803318 cue the pleas for epistemological relativism in the face of insurmountable pwnage
3803319 up until the point where he rejects evolution as an explanation for altruism
3803320 do pay attention to what he says he tends to be right
3803321 i was only addressing the empirical question of whether belief in god and evolution are incompatible
3803322 i disagree for the reasons stated above why do you think the metaphor was fine
3803323 solo queremos probar suerte como solistas pero nunca nos separaremos
3803324 you should know why johnny lingo paid eight cows for his wife
3803325 get johnny lingo to help you find what you want and let him do the bargaining
3803326 johnny lingo a boy seated nearby hooted the name and rocked with laughter
3803327 everybody tells me to get in touch with johnny lingo and then breaks up let me in on the joke
3803328 johnnys the brightest the strongest young man in the islands and for his age the richest
3803329 but if hes all you say what is there to laugh about
3803330 only one thing five months ago at fall festival johnny came to kiniwata and found himself a wife he paid her father eight cows
3803331 eight cows she must have beauty that takes your breath away
3803332 but the kindest could only call sarita plain sam karoo her father was afraid shed be left on his hands
3803333 but then he got eight cows for her isnt that extraordinary
3803334 i said it would be kindness to call her plain she was skinny she walked with her shoulders hunched and her head ducked she was scared of her own shadow
3803335 and thats why the villagers grin when they talk about johnny they get special satisfaction from the fact that the sharpest trader in the islands was bested by dull old sam karoo
3803336 they say theres nothing i might want they you cant help me get
3803337 always and forever when they speak of marriage settlements it will be remembered that johnny lingo paid eight cows for sarita
3803338 theres only one sarita perhaps she does not look the way they say she looked in kiniwata
3803339 she doesnt i heard she was homely they all make fun of you because you let yourself be cheated by sam karoo
3803340 what it must mean to a woman to know that her husband has settled on the lowest price for which she can be bought and then later when the women talk they boast of what their husbands paid for them one says four cows another maybe six how does she feel the woman who was sold for one or two
3803341 then you did this just to make your wife happy
3803342 i wanted sarita to be happy yes but i wanted more than that you say she is different this is true many things can change a woman things that happen inside things that happen outside but the thing that matters most is what she thinks about herself in kiniwata sarita believed she was worth nothing now she knows she is worth more than any other woman in the islands
3803343 i wanted to marry sarita i loved her and no other woman
3803344 johnny obrigada por tudo sem voc eu n o teria chegado a lugar algum n s vamos arrebentar
3803345 as pessoas pensam que eu sou realmente confiante mas eu fico envergonhada de me despir em p blico como muitas mulheres eu n o fui fotografada por livre e espont nea vontade de biqu ni por sete anos e n o creio que eu vou faz lo novamente
3803346 she had her first performance when she was six since then i cant remember a time when she isnt singing something
3803347 it is a common misconception that an image invariably involves a figure of speech
3803348 in spite of the exercise books and the negative approach of our schools language stays alive it is often more alive in the mouths of truck drivers than in the correct mouths of people who feel that there is a single proper or correct way to say everything

3803465 a senior bush administration counterterrorism official said tuesday that an analysis of public statements by al qaeda in the past year shows that nearly half the verbiage is devoted to justifying the groups legitimacy
3803466 have devoted nearly half their airtime to defending the groups legitimacy
3803467 this defensive tone continues a trend observed since at least last summer and reflects concern over allegations by militant leaders and religious scholars that al qaeda and its affiliates have violated the islamic laws of war particularly in iraq and north africa
3803468 at least hundreds of thousands of innocent people if not millions

3803475 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
3803476 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
3803477 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
3803478 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid
3803479 now that school is over everybody is really getting into their playbook were keying into our plays its coming along good for us at linebacker
3803480 we had a good spring we have a couple of guys with experience and some young guys were going to be alright
3803481 hes doing good hes good he came in early and hes really getting to know the plays he came in and took a different attitude towards the game he got into his playbook and worked hard right away
3803482 im not a perfect guy i just need to keep working hard and getting better
3803483 my job right now is to focus on the linebackers were getting better were trying to get better everyday
3803484 its down to those three and were going to give them the work on friday night and see where it goes on saturday
3803485 the idea is to find a guy who we think we can win with we made that decision to cut it to three those three guys all have something we like about them and its all down to how they perform in these next two scrimmages
3803486 he is very similar to the kids we had at bc that played the field linebacker position
3803487 its almost a hybrid position you still need the two bigger guys inside but the guy in the field is a half linebacker half strong safety type looking at him last year i dont think he could play in the secondary for us and wouldnt have played for us this year but its a perfect position for him with what his talents are
3803488 unless somebody lines up in two tights ends and two backs and wants to go smashmouth thats the only time hes got to be in there to play run defense
3803489 he can do that hes not going to do it 65 plays but nobody plays that way in football anymore
3803490 with all the wideouts everybody has the field spread hes wide to the field so hes got to have skills to be a pass cover hes got to understand the passing game which he did at strong safety and hes got to come in and get in the box when the ball is run its similar to what he did last year but now hes six yards closer to the line of scrimmage than he used to be
3803491 weve had success with that for a long time we went out this year in the spring a couple of coaches went to a couple of different places more and more people are getting to that type of play so it kind of suited what we did at bc
3803492 youve got to get into some type of substitution defense youre almost in nickel defense all the time now anyways
3803493 weve had two surgeries here in the last couple of days
3803494 toney baker has had surgery to clear out some things in his knee so hes on the shelf for a while until he comes back from that
3803495 clem johnson broke his jaw in the scrimmage so hes out for maybe the year
3803496 the way he was playing he would have been the starter at safety for us with the way he was going its a big loss for us right now
3803497 if he doesnt the thing with the jaw is you dont want to eat and you lose all that weight all that problem with trying to get substance in him hell start all over once it heals which is a lengthy process anyways
3803498 this affects you me everyone in the united states who takes pharmaceuticals
3803499 pharmacutical companies wont put a drug out there if they cant make a million dollars a day on it a lot of those drugs dont make a million dollars a year so it doesnt affect a very large segment of our population
3803500 the top brand name drugs went up 8 percent last year and that happens every single year
3803501 the biggest thing you can do is when you see a doctor ask if there is a generic alternative that you can take thats the key
3803502 we think this underscores best buys strong working relationship with apple and provides even greater differentiation from peers
3803503 in addition we believe the iphone will help grow traffic and sales in this years holiday season which could be weak overall on slowed consumer spending
3803504 we believe that despite the difficult economic times market share gains and price stability are leading to positive same store sales this quarter for best buy
3803505 hurt demand or at least foot traffic to best buy and circuit city
3803506 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3803507 our customers are looking for this product we do believe that broadening our assortment and having iphone in our stores is certainly going to be very important heading into the holiday season

3803572 the value added by bringing in one of the most decorated wrestlers in piaa history as well as one of lehighs all time greats is yet another step this program is taking in its quest to win the national title troy has had amazing success on the national level and that experience is vital to his role as director of operations
3803573 im very excited to join the penn state staff especially at this time
3803574 penn state is in a great place right now and theres an exciting buzz about the program with all these changes and with the talent on this team this group of guys from the talent on the staff to the talent in the wrestling room is poised to win a national title and im thrilled to be a part of it

3803576 i believe my attitude enthusiasm and love for this sport are a perfect fit here at penn state and im ready to contribute to the teams success in any way i can
3803577 aaron did an outstanding job for us last year as the director of operations
3803578 this opportunity to move from the administrative side of our program to the coaching side is one im pleased hes accepted his work ethic and skills on the mat will be a huge asset to us as we continue our drive to win a national team title aaron will be vital in helping our upper weights continue their progress towards all america status
3803579 the european players have far greater opportunities they hone their skills in top leagues and face the best teams they gain lots of experience from that and its a huge help in developing their game
3803580 were travelling the length and breadth of china we started in hong kong then it was tianjin we were here today and now well be flying to shanghai i hope our tour ends in beijing
3803581 those guys are my boys and they played so hard for me they went into battle tonight and they have improved on the international stage in my heart the boys won the gold medal
3803582 the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
3803583 greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us one from the other
3803584 there is another wall that exists on the us mexican border this wall is still under construction this wall is here must we ignore it
3803585 technology to deter and prevent crossings along the us borders with canada and mexico
3803586 every single mayor from brownsville to el paso is against it border wall
3803587 this will be a tremendous waste of money and it will not stop illegal immigration people will just go around it
3803588 hemisphere where all men can hope for a suitable standard of living and all can live out their lives in dignity and in freedom
3803589 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3803590 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3803591 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3803592 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3803593 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3803594 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3803595 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies
3803596 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3803597 as you know through the nato membership if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3803598 i do not see any obtainable objectives in lebanon and the longer we stay there the harder it will be to leave
3803599 nous lui avons d j donn un certain apprentissage par r p tition puisquil reproduit certaines actions
3803600 dans les 24 heures a soulign le chercheur des connexions ont pouss entre eux
3803601 en une semaine il sest produit des impulsions lectriques spontan es et ce qui paraissait tre une activit de cerveau ordinaire
3803602 nous avons utilis cette r action pour relier le cerveau au robot avec des lectrodes d sormais le cerveau contr le le robot et celui ci apprend par r p tition
3803603 maintenant nous tudions comment lui apprendre en augmentant le voltage sur diff rents lectrodes
3803604 sil est un certain endroit et que nous voulons le faire aller droite nous pouvons envoyer une stimulation lectrique
3803605 nous voulons comprendre comment les souvenirs sont archiv s dans un cerveau biologique par rapport un cerveau dordinateur
3803606 des stimulations les connexions se renforcent il semble devenir plus alerte
3803607 nos travaux ont ainsi un rapport avec alzheimer en ce qui concerne le stockage de la m moire et comment on peut le renforcer
3803608 est une version simplifi e de ce qui se passe dans le cerveau humain mais l on peut regarder et contr ler les l ments essentiels comme nous le voulons
3803609 et cest dr le fait remarquer le chercheur il y a des diff rences entre eux il y en a un un peu violent un peu actif un autre ne fera pas ce quon lui demande il s crasera contre les murs chacun a sa personnalit
3803610 i set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons ill develop new nuclear weapons on a secret global ban on production of fissile material ill negotiate with russia
3803611 i see my sons regularly but have nowhere to take them i want to meet them and take them to my home not to a tent
3803612 i have just got my forklift licence but finding work is difficult when you have a criminal record and dont have an address
3803613 i dont like having to go from room to room and i dont like living here but i feel like its my only choice
3803614 circumstances that can affect any of us such as divorce debt redundancy domestic abuse addiction and mental and physical health issues can and in our experience do contribute to homelessness
3803615 some of these people have exhausted any other avenues and have ended up with no other option its not a solution just a very temporary basic help intervention
3803616 these people are human beings and they deserve a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs no matter how they got there
3803617 it just isnt possible to open the doors of any old building and let people in just like any business serving food or accommodating people there are certain regulations to follow
3803618 homelessness is a big problem and while places like the salvation army and ymca provide a vital service they are almost always full to capacity because people are not moving on
3803619 wilbury house provides a short term answer but if nowhere else can be found then people have to return to the street i sometimes think people are better off being left there rather than build their hopes up like that
3803620 in the lead up to this years elections all three parties agreed that a night shelter was not the way forward
3803621 we looked to our local counterparts in norfolk cambridgeshire and essex where they had night shelters in operation but we found that if anything rough sleeping had increased in fact norwich was forced to close its shelter
3803622 the estimated cost of opening such a facility was about 1million to find that money would mean a ten per cent increase in council tax and in the current climate such an increase could push other people over the boundary
3803623 they dont have to be there the reason why we still see people sleeping rough is that some people just dont want help others simply wont engage with authority so its not that help isnt available
3803624 we have in the past tried to help and were not turning our back on these people or anyone who is in need but we cant force people to accept our help suffolk homes

3803643 unlike some other health care trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
3803644 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them and their actuaries develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
3803645 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs
3803646 this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community

3803651 i have no view on whether it should be remade but it doesnt have my blessing
3803652 im not co producing it and i wont be involved in any way
3803653 the first i heard about it was when people sent me cuttings from us papers
3803654 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth
3803655 our hope has always been that each new endeavour and rebirth will expose the rocky horror experience to new audiences and expand the fan base
3803656 the original has some qualities that cant be reproduced but a remake could have its own very different strengths and qualities
3803657 i dont really want to answer that at the moment
3803658 we have other things to worry about and we need to get back in the right direction
3803659 we can definitely do better than where we are now particularly with the rule changes its a big opportunity to put a good car out there
3803660 the future is here well next year then well see

3803664 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3803665 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3803666 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3803667 the club gave me time and i appreciate that i feel for sure ive made 100 per cent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3803668 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3803669 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3803670 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3803671 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3803672 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3803673 wieso klappt das bei anderen verb nden aber bei uns nicht
3803674 the biggest challenge for open source or any other kind of software development for that matter is finding the right information to solve a problem adding automatic hardware tagging to our search data not only improves the relevance of our support but also gives it developers the most reliable information faster and with the analytical tools to make the right decision based on their exact environment no phone calls into support no trouble tickets just search on your desktop
3803675 our innovations in search technology combined with our sophisticated data gathering and diagnostics tools free technologists from waiting on hold for minutes or hours for support
3803676 the reason for the expected sharp dampening of inflation is that the recent key drivers of the cpix and cpi food electricity and petrol will all be significantly down weighted in particular the influence of food prices falls by a third and electricitys by a half
3803677 there will also be a level drop for cpi inflation and this could see it starting 2009 around 10 for the total country measure instead of closer to the 12 we would estimate under the current weighting system and falling below 6 midyear

3803686 they solve problems all the time at the bedside research is just more rigorous problem solving
3803687 im ecstatic i made the move i can make a contribution here and also be on the cutting edge of research
3803688 with more patients being released from the hospital soon after major surgery we need to determine how to aid recovery when patients arent with us

3803690 it seems there were concerns raised by the chef de mission of the danish team who accompanied her that it was a condition of that visit that it be private and there be no filming within the residential area
3803691 we certainly werent aware of that condition and if that was the condition then we are sorry that we didnt comply with it
3803692 neither her royal highness or prince frederick themselves expressed any concerns to me at the time the chef de mission did and we asked the television crew just to back off
3803693 i am finishing a small attic space in a 100 year old house a 6 8 foot gable that comes out from a hip roof i am trying to figure out how to insulate the knee walls which are 5 feet high someone told me i should leave an air space between the insulation and walls to prevent condensation and dry rot or should i fill all six inches with batt insulation on the exposed walls and then cover with a vapor barrier

3803702 we have no other choice because no other country came to our aid
3803703 it is particularly satisfying to receive recognition from a national organization that feels as passionately about hispanic higher education issues as we do here at csu pueblo
3803704 its not how large of an institution they are but how committed they are to the hacus mission
3803705 in terms of level of engagement in providing support for advocacy work and our programs csu pueblo has been very much at the top
3803706 we feel by honoring the institution we are motivating young people in the area to reach as high as they can to make their dreams of higher education become a reality
3803707 meeting the educational needs of the hispanic community is an important part of our mission as a hispanic serving institution
3803708 we want to serve the entire population of southern colorado and while most of our students are not hispanic we know we will not be doing our job if we dont make particular efforts to recruit retain and graduate hispanic students
3803709 the economic future of colorado will depend on our collective ability to do so

3803727 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3803728 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3803729 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3803730 how the fuck did i get here who the hell is this stranger starin all in my face
3803731 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3803732 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3803733 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3803734 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3803735 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3803736 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3803737 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3803738 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3803739 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3803775 parents havent learnt the fact that much of what has been promised will not be delivered for another three or four years much of the new technology cannot be in place until the academy itself has been built

3803785 the pattern drove me crazy and made everything feel crowded

3803787 we didnt need a big house we just needed a little house that felt bigger than it was
3803788 i think that most companies lack the skills to add internet collaboration tools to their environments particularly those that have traditionally focused on back end processing rather than front end applications
3803789 they are beginning to hire younger people who have the skills but they still need the corporate blessing to do something with them in the short term they usually hire some geeks from a company that has three people to help develop the applications
3803790 we have seen renewed interest in all things internet as a result of web 2 0 technologies but the kind of training people are asking for is less about understanding the issues and applications involved and more about effective communication and why and what is effective rather than how to do it
3803791 it is a new course area so was always going to be a bit more popular but we have noticed a lot of demand for podcasting which is surprising because it is almost an old technology for web 2 0 though people ask for videocasting as well

3803837 methane is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of global warming potential so its really a significant contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas
3803838 this biogas emission reduction project can produce 110 000 cers per year and thats our estimate so far part of the income thats coming from the sale of the cers will be shared with the quezon city government and this will fund social economic projects for quezon city especially for payatas

3803942 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there

3803948 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3803949 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3803950 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3803951 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3803952 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3803953 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund

3803957 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3803958 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3803970 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
3803971 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class

3804173 we are delighted that digital mammography will soon become a reality here at prince county hospital
3804174 the genuine interest in this campaign has been overwhelming and we are so thankful to the many groups organizations and individuals who have already supported this great cause
3804175 without a doubt having access to this new technology is extremely important for women as we look to a future where cancer is caught and treated earlier

3804192 the projects goal is to provide intensive in home and community based education designed to change individual and community practices regarding pest control and the use of pesticides
3804193 educational programs about pest management are desperately needed because residents will often turn to restricted and illegal pesticides which can be very dangerous and do not eliminate the pests
3804194 our team trains the residents in ipm and we also utilize a train the trainer approach in which people are trained to provide education about ipm to newly arriving residents during their orientation
3804195 buybacks are scheduled to coincide with bostons biannual residential hazardous waste collection so far this project has collected a wide array of pesticides including over the counter sprays and bombs as well as restricted use pesticides that by law can only be applied by a licensed professional
3804196 instead of routinely spraying pesticides in an entire complex the pest control company does inspections and only applies gels in units that need it
3804197 treatments are also tailored toward the individual development the way pests spread in a three story building will be very different from a building with 20 stories
3804198 people are beginning to see they no longer have to live with their pest problems they feel empowered by being able to take control of their pest problems and their health
3804199 at the state level the massachusetts public health association will educate its members about ipm support ipm advocacy and provide training for community health workers in addition the asthma regional council is developing a handbook and kit on ipm for building managers and promoting it to the 375 housing authorities in new england a similar tool will be aimed at health plans interested in home environmental assessments education and supplies

3804237 president mugabe and the leader of the opposition mdc have signed the agreement tsvangirai refused to do so at the last moment but this does not affect progress the principals of the other two parties have agreed that they cannot wait any longer and the nation demands progress as such president mugabe will go ahead and form the next government and parliament will soon sit
3804238 president mbeki understands that the negotiations cannot be stalled any longer
3804239 the paper came as a surprise even to tsvangirais negotiators and everyone objected to its introduction as it sought to override the agreements that had already been reached by the three parties it seemed that reason would prevail for the sake of progress but at the last minute tsvangirai declined to sign that is why you saw tendai biti saying afterwards that he was confident the negotiations would continue
3804240 the fear is that tsvangirai might take too long to sign the agreement in which case the other two parties will simply go ahead and form the next government
3804241 the deal is not sustainable and it is not going to solve the crisis the country is experiencing
3804242 zanu pf is not prepared to concede power they would rather divide conquer and rule
3804243 whatever they do they should not ignore the morgan tsvangirai faction as this would result in a serious legitimacy crisis for any government that will be formed
3804244 there is no way the economy will recover if sanctions imposed by western countries are still in place
3804245 to put it mildly mugabes government has displayed very poor economic management and zimbabwes economy will not recover until his disastrous policies are reversed
3804246 the leaders of our political parties must rise up to the challenge to provide leadership
3804247 they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3804248 space to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators mugabe and mutambara have agreed
3804249 all three parties must agree if there is to be an agreement there is no way you can extract a bilateral agreement from a tripartite process
3804250 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people
3804251 i am quite certain that all the of the parties are determined to find a solution

3804263 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted

3804287 all vineyard soils contain around 20 to 30 trace metals like selenium or molybdenum for example
3804288 the patterns change according to which region you are in first youd establish what the pattern of trace metals was in wines made only from grapes grown in montalcino then youd analyse wines from any regions outside montalcino which you think have been used as blending material wines labelled as brunello falling outside the statistical pattern of the soils from which they are supposed to have been grown on can thus be identified and matched to where they might really have been sourced from

3804304 the communist party usas newspaper is defending democratic presidential candidate barack obama against potential defectors on the left saying his candidacy represents a broad multi class multicultural movement
3804305 barack obama is not a left candidate the editorial said this fact has seemingly surprised a number of progressive people who are bemoaning obamas shift to the center its sad that some who seek progressive change are missing the forest for the trees
3804306 but they will not dampen the wide and deep enthusiasm for blocking a third bush term represented by john mccain or for bringing obama by a landslide into the white house with a large democratic congressional majority it added
3804307 the editorial though never using the word endorse expressed excitement about his candidacy

3804310 while there was a marginal increase in the numbers of students that sat the higher paper in maths this year when you take into account the fact that more students sat the leaving certificate this year compared with last year the numbers are disappointing
3804311 for the past number of years the high failure rate in maths and the small numbers choosing to take higher level has made the headlines it is time to stop posturing and tackle the problem head on radical solutions must be introduced immediately
3804312 between 1999 and 2007 the irish medical devices workforce grew from 16 000 to over 24 000 representing nearly 10 per cent of irelands total manufacturing workforce this employment is sustained by the availability of highly skilled and educated workforce and is particularly reliant on skills in science and engineering subjects
3804313 ireland needs high levels of achievement in science and technology and to realise this a sea change in how we teach how we resource and how we deal with these courses is needed fianna f il has failed to meet the challenges posed by falling participation rates and achievement in maths and the sciences
3804314 there is no doubt that it is a milestone exam and that it marks an important turning point in the life of every student
3804315 however i want to urge them to remember that there is more to life than the leaving certificate the result they received today will not dictate the path their lives take
3804316 it is easy and very understandable to be disappointed if the desired results are not achieved but there is more than one path to any career choice and there have never been more options available for third level education and training opportunities

3804318 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3804319 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3804320 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3804321 we dont know yet how many men carried out the attack
3804322 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3804323 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way

3804343 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
3804344 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
3804345 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
3804346 poti is one of the most important ports in the black sea
3804347 the offensive means that the ceasefire is dead back to ground zero
3804348 right in front me no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
3804349 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
3804350 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
3804351 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of this ceasefire they pledged not to move from their positions and stop firing
3804352 what this adds up to however while we may have have a ceasefire on the ground this is an extraordinary show of russian force
3804353 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
3804354 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
3804355 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3804356 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3804357 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
3804358 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
3804359 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori

3804375 fire eagle allowed us to easily add location data to pownce using their simple api
3804376 pownce users can now say where they are and geo tag their notes which adds a new dimension to the service
3804377 right upon sign up users are given the option to receive regular e mails from yahoo to see if they are still comfortable with sharing this kind of information
3804378 if you do not respond to this e mail yahoo will automatically disable your fire eagle account yahoo also allows users to turn the service off when they want to keep their location private
3804379 once it is running smoothly again we would not be surprised if fire eagle could make good on its promise of becoming the central clearinghouse for location services
3804380 already close to 800 developers are working on applications that make use of fire eagle in some form or another
3804381 while users have full control over their current fire eagle status which only includes their current position and keeps no log the partner services theyve signed up for may continue to display their location history indefinitely
3804382 fire eagle says that as part of the terms of service partner services must agree to let users delete their messages but this will be impossible to enforce ultimately it will be up to users to selectivity give their information to the services they trust

3804410 this year we have been working just as feverishly on the nonexistent home gutting program
3804411 what this study shows is that doctors should be doing regular monitoring of these children over time because a one time checkup might not be enough to tell if they are at risk for developing diabetes
3804412 to better treat at risk children we need better ways to monitor beta cell function and visceral fat buildup
3804413 those are tough to measure but are probably the main factors determining who will get type 2 diabetes
3804414 the study provides great insight into the risk factors that lead to the progression towards type 2 diabetes in this population
3804415 only by understanding how this devastating disease develops will be able to begin taking steps to prevent it
3804416 i was debt free i lost my health my home and my pet

3804425 n o produzimos mais porque a cota que nos foi atribu da n o permite e a solu o para aumentar a produ o seria a obrigatoriedade de introdu o de uma porcentagem de biodiesel no diesel comum porque assim haveria igualdade de concorr ncia entre todas as petrol feras
3804426 o modelo de introdu o de biocombust veis no consumo em portugal n o funciona e tem que ser adaptado para o neg cio do biodiesel
3804427 o nosso modelo arrancou numa base de voluntarismo de introdu o de biocombust veis no consumo em que os distribuidores petrol feros est o convidados a introduzir biodiesel isto no in cio funcionou mas depois os mercados internacionais do diesel e do leo vegetal tiveram ciclos de mudan a de pre os que fizeram com que os distribuidores petrol feros n o tivessem interesse em comprar biodiesel

3804468 i am a college graduate and have no delusions what will occur as an end result of these proceedings

3804483 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3804484 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3804485 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3804486 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3804487 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty

3804496 i dont feel comfortable talking about this because it is a complicated issue for the brand
3804497 the question is do you have to love someone who loves you
3804498 the worst thing to do is turn off someone who is that passionate about you
3804499 a brand doesnt have to actively embrace someone like kendra but they should certainly be willing to accept the fact that shes willing to tell the world how much she loves them

3804510 this all sounds more about local politics and the exercise of power than it is about seven acres of corn
3804511 but it makes you wonder why in this day and age some government officials would be willing to have several thousands of dollars of perfectly good feed corn deliberately go to waste
3804512 even if i am a minority of one truth is still the truth
3804513 the smallest minority on earth is the individual those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities
3804514 there are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakably as a dictatorship one party rule executions without trial or with a mock trial for political offenses the nationalization or expropriation of private property and censorship a country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives any claim to national rights or sovereignty and becomes an outlaw

3804524 nobodys trying harder theyre listening to manny offers but the big issue is trying to get a bat back that will protect david ortiz in the lineup theyre not going to do something stupid just to get rid of him
3804525 underscores the gops struggle to define itself in the shadow of an unpopular president and in the wake of defeat in the 2006 midterm election
3804526 neither leach nor chafee is particularly known for his staunch conservatism theyre members of one of the least popular species in the political zoo rinos or republicans in name only
3804527 really served as a reminder of how thin those party crossover groups actually are
3804528 the democrats or republicans who start them arent exactly mainstream spokespeople for their party
3804529 the crossover groups tell us about as much about obama and mccain as they have about past presidential candidates nothing
3804530 obama is no fiscal tightwad the cbo scores his proposals as less damaging to fiscal balance than mccains
3804531 i t only takes a few points here or there to alter the election
3804532 w hen candidates tout bipartisan credentials the point is usually to stress an ability to work with and listen to other elected officials not to stop voting on the platform outlined by a politicians campaign or party
3804533 obama may have some republicans in his camp they arent doing attack dog politics like liebermans doing for mccain
3804534 can use this discontent to not only get elected but to create as many converts to liberal principles as reagan did to conservative ones
3804535 i just thought theres got to be a better way
3804536 i love to see things come to life why am i so excited about a silly piece of metal because it works like silly good
3804537 everybody thinks ball markers have to be round but the rules changed five years ago
3804538 now you can use anything it could be a phone book if you want
3804539 when you align the putt and you know its dead nuts perfect then when you go to stand over the putt its all positive things that youre thinking its so simple but you can gain confidence
3804540 if you use it once you never want to be without it again
3804541 im constantly thinking of ways to create the next product make the product better what i dont want to do is just create a new product every year because i have to create new products i dont have to do anything
3804542 i think i get red flagged whether its ours or somebody elses we analyze the putter see what loft it has what lie what weight it has what shaft flex it has people say shaft flex shaft flex means a lot as far as performance if its too soft on putts over 20 feet theres a kick putts under 20 feet not a lot going on so what we analyze is 20 feet so you can see whats going on
3804543 we can watch a ball perform then talk about what a persons doing even before we actually look at the person its kind of like being a mechanic the engines not firing right so why isnt it youve got to look at the timing the spark plugs so on same with a putting stroke look at the ball you look at the golf ball first the putter second and the person third
3804544 i think in the old days greens were so shabby
3804545 people say theres no arc in the putter stroke well is there an arc in a golf swing of course there is there is an arc in the putter stroke i wish there wasnt but there is it comes from the lie angle of the shaft the usga says its must be at least 10 percent not straight up and down with that angle there must be an arc i wish we could putt between our legs 90 degrees square to square but the usga says we cant putt between our legs so i design putters to fit those arcs so that it becomes almost effortless for the putter
3804546 were never sitting still were always going forward when youre sitting still youre going to get passed but its tough to get passed when youre moving forward
3804547 go back to some of the great putter makers before my time they didnt have the technology the hi speed video the machinery that i have im just carrying the torch from where they had been and i want to carry that torch into the future by being able to use the technology from today

3804568 kuwait was caught by surprise last time when iraqi troops invaded the small emirate and routed the kuwaiti army in just a few hours
3804569 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
3804570 we did it because we thought it was going to be something nice something with no problem
3804571 but somebody wants to talk about it it is too much of a big deal with you guys the media and everybody talking about that
3804572 if i go to play with a taller team and i put here raising up on the tips of his toes it is not an offense
3804573 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it just because to me it was a little clownish for our part to be doing that
3804574 but the sponsors insisted and insisted i think it is just a bad idea i guess to do that but it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
3804575 i didnt find it very funny i didnt find it offensive either i guess some guys didnt mind to me i dont want to be that way i guess to be doing that stuff
3804576 if anybody feels offended by it we totally apologize for it we never meant anything offensive by it
3804577 if you put it in the wrong context and put it with the wrong people or a different kind of people you could take it that way
3804578 but not with our group and not with our people i would find that a wrong read
3804579 stop getting booked in places i wont be at it damnit
3804580 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3804581 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3804582 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3804583 i got an american record in my 200 free she said i wasnt as fast as i wanted in the 200 im but i did my best
3804584 i did this double at the olympic trials so i was confident i could pull it off here
3804585 part of the thing with katie is she has a lot of chances to do well and that is part of the reason she enters such a big program yetter said
3804586 i think she is capable of doing anything she wants right now she is having a good meet
3804587 its a faster meet than any other olympics yetter said
3804588 the 200 im she hoff had to take a chance and get out there fast yetter said
3804589 at some point you have to take a chance to win or to medal
3804590 shes a stud who swam many many events and many unusual doubles coughlin said of hoff but the 200 free and 200 im she would be tired
3804591 its so hard hoff said of the olympic meet after the 400 free
3804592 people say dont worry about it think of it as just another meet its not just another meet
3804593 our olympic trials are so hard said 1964 olympic champion donna devarona

3804596 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
3804597 throw the legitimacy of the election into question because it is so one sided
3804598 unequivocally held that same sex couples have a constitutional right to marry
3804599 the attorney general did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the chief purpose and effect of the initiative is to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry
3804600 since the superior court would not exercise its authority to protect voters against misleading language we will ask the appellate court to do so
3804601 its important that voters know exactly what this measure would do which is to change the constitution to eliminate a fundamental right the right to marry from one group of people
3804602 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3804603 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3804604 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3804605 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3804606 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3804607 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3804608 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3804609 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3804610 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3804611 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3804612 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3804613 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3804614 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3804615 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3804616 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3804617 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3804618 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3804619 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3804620 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3804621 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3804622 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3804623 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3804624 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3804625 we intend to leave the final outcome to the voters
3804626 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
3804627 the good news today is were going to move a capital bill forward

3804664 behold adam has become as one of us because he knows good from bad and now let him not put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and thus live forever
3804665 and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
3804666 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was invisible and without form and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and god called the firmament heaven and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and god said let the earth bring forth grass for fodder and the fruit tree yielding fruit and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven that they may be for a light upon the earth and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to rule over the day and over the night
3804667 now the whole heaven or the universe or whatever other name would be most acceptable to it so let it be named by us did it exist eternally having no beginning of generation or has it come into being starting from some beginning it has come into being for it can be seen and handled and has a body and all such things are the objects of sensation and such objects of sensation being apprehensible by opinion with the aid of sensation are things that came into being as we saw and have been generated it follows therefore according to the reasonable theory that we ought to affirm that this universe came into being as a living creature possessing soul and intelligence in very truth both by the providence of god
3804668 and god said let us make man in our image and our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and said be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over all the cattle and over all the earth
3804669 gods of gods those works whose artificer and father i am will abide indissoluble so long as it is my will lo all that hath been fastened may be loosed yet to will to loose that which is harmonious and in good case were the act of an evil being wherefore since ye have come into being ye are not immortal or indissoluble altogether nevertheless ye shall by no means be loosed or meet with the doom of death since ye have found in my will a bond more mighty and more potent than those wherewith ye were bound when ye came into being now therefore hearken to the saying which i proclaim unto you three kinds of mortal beings still remain unborn and unless these have birth the heaven will be incomplete for it will not have within itself all the kinds of living things yet if these should come into being and receive a share of life at my hands they would become equal to gods therefore in order that they may be mortal and that this all may be all in very truth turn ye according to your nature to the contriving of living things imitating my power even as i showed it in generating you and such part of them as is fitted to receive the same name as the immortals which is called divine and the power in them that governs all who are willing ever to follow justice and you this part i having sowed it and originated the same will deliver to you for the rest do you weaving the mortal with the immortal contrive living beings and bring them to birth then by giving them sustenance increase them and when they perish receive them back again
3804670 if each one of these also should come to exist by me it would of necessity become immortal
3804671 such part of them as is immortal must needs be given to these by the creator
3804672 and thou shalt say unto pharaoh israel is my son my firstborn and i have said to thee let my people go that they may serve me but thou didst refuse to let them go
3804673 and they say unto him the god of the hebrews hath summoned us we will go therefore three days journey into the desert that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god
3804674 the lord the god of the hebrews hath sent me unto thee saying let my people go that they may serve me in the wilderness
3804675 do not think that he is the god of jews only but also of gentiles yea of gentiles also
3804676 and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name before we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men had builded and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they have begun to do and now nothing will be withholden from them which they purpose to do go to let us go down and there confound their language that no man may understand the speech of his neighbour so the lord god scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city and the tower
3804677 i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt
3804678 for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third generation
3804679 thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain
3804680 phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them and i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy
3804681 phinehas hath turned away my wrath from the children of israel in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them
3804682 why were you so ungrateful to our gods as to desert them for the jews
3804683 solomon was also proficient in the secret cult of god

3804696 the geographic areas covered by rural neighbourhood policing officers will tend to be fairly large due to the wider spread of population and may encompass a number of villages or smaller settlements the officers role will be to identify the priorities that are important to the people living in the area they cover and to work with local people and other partners on solving those problems in addition to resources that other partners may be able to offer to support the officer they will be able to call on other neighbourhood officers sergeants pcs and police community support officers from surrounding neighbourhoods police response teams and other specialized police resources to help them when necessary in many areas there are also special constables other community volunteers and neighbourhood watch working with neighbourhood teams so although i can understand your concern at the apparent coverage the real picture is far more positive

3804710 war in the causasus towards a broader russia us military confrontation
3804711 attacks were timed to coincide with the olympics largely with a view to avoiding frontpage media coverage

3804716 commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
3804717 spread to georgias second breakaway province of abkhazia where separatist rebels and the russian air force launched an all out attack on georgian forces

3804721 russia accused georgia of killing more than 2000 people mostly civilians in south ossetia

3804732 the war in georgia is a war for the west

3804793 now i think its an exciting game weve done a lot of things that appeal to fans weve moved the mound back moved the fences back
3804794 you get to an olympic arena you get the best pitchers in the world
3804795 and i dont care if its major leagues or softball great pitching is going to control the game a little it
3804796 right now we have a gold medal on our minds when were out there on the field that thats the only thing thats going through any of our minds
3804797 fifteen years ago we had that white ball and we threw from 40 feet
3804798 it was ugly game to watch it was an ugly game to coach
3804799 now i think its an exciting game weve done a lot of things that appeal to fans weve moved the mound back moved the fences back
3804800 you get to an olympic arena you get the best pitchers in the world
3804801 and i dont care if its major leagues or softball great pitching is going to control the game a little it
3804802 right now we have a gold medal on our minds when were out there on the field that thats the only thing thats going through any of our minds
3804803 your conscious mind might tell you to vote for obama but in the privacy of the election booth your unconscious biases may vote differently
3804804 it remains to be seen but cautiously i think america is ready
3804805 extensive amounts of research have demonstrated the prevalence of stereotyping prejudice and discrimination but where others saw mere statistics trish saw an opportunity the premise upon which much of her research is based is that people desire to be good
3804806 in her personality lectures and research trish consistently conveys this message of optimism
3804807 i felt like i was this lone voice in the field saying you can trust what people say about their values but everybody was incredibly suspicious there was this clarion call to not trust peoples verbal reports because they are going to lie because it is socially acceptable to be non prejudiced i thought that was incredibly cynical
3804808 it turns out that the work i was doing changed the direction of the field it caused people to step up and take notice
3804809 prejudice is the legacy of our socialization experiences we all learn these stereotypes and have these biases at the ready whether we condone them or not whether we think they are good or not and as a result the immediate reaction is a biased one
3804810 if you are going to respond in nonbiased ways you have to have to gain control or override the automatically activated stereotypic response and instead respond in these thoughtful deliberate ways that might represent your personal values
3804811 it is almost impossible not to bump into devines research be it an introductory psychology textbook or in other researchers scholarly publications
3804812 whats most remarkable is that devines groundbreaking work of the late 1980s and early 1990s has stood the test of time the findings have been repeatedly replicated and they have served as a mighty catalyst for further investigation
3804813 eliminating prejudice is a process making that decision is the first step but then what you have to do is put some effort into it
3804814 just making the decision doesnt mean you wake up one day stretch and say im not prejudiced because you have got this whole socialization experience that you grew up with
3804815 when peoples values conflicted what i predicted is that if they were sincere in their non prejudicial beliefs they would feel guilty and self critical and they would hold themselves accountable
3804816 when given a chance low prejudice people tried to learn from mistakes tried to absorb material and at the next opportunity when prejudice was possible they responded in a fair and unbiased way
3804817 high internal high external individuals are not good at responding without bias so what they need is help learning to respond without bias they already have the motivation we need to give them the skills
3804818 for the high external individuals we need to create internal motivation that is what will rid them of prejudice over time
3804819 the low internal high external individuals on a campus like this receive a lot of pressure and not in a gentle way people say the way you think is wrong and people who like you are stupid you start to get irritated and you push the message away
3804820 that is one of the things i worry about backlash the harder non prejudiced norms are pushed on them the more they cement their walls of resistance for such individuals reducing prejudice requires finding ways to crack those walls of resistance

3804911 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3804912 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3804913 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3804914 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3804915 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3804916 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3804917 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3804918 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3804919 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3804920 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

3804923 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3804924 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3804925 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3804926 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

3804934 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

3805043 im thinking this kind of daily bulletin format might be a better way of covering the happenings inside the cbc rather than me trying to make a news story post out of big items

3805072 we mag journalists protest against the deliberate political take over of the weekly magazine at which we are employed the magazine mag which has been published since 1995 was created as a response to media single mindedness in it were presented alternative points of view which could not be expressed in other media during the period of slovenias accession to euro atlantic alliances mag decisively advocated membership of both the eu and nato the candidate for new responsible editor veso stojanov opposed nato in his articles in addition to which he comes from a different circle of thought than present mag readers although the weekly mag has changed owners or publishers three times since its founding its editorial policy has not been changed the newspaper house salomon 2000 which bought mag from the company interdat was even proud that it could publish a weekly with politically relevant contents and opinions the then management of delo under the leadership of toma perovi also had a similar position at the time of buying the magazine it did not revoke mags right to autonomy and the expression of various political positions under the present owner sales of mag have increased by approximately half the highest growth has been marked precisely in the period since silvester urla took over the editorship sales of recent numbers have exceeded 14 000 copies which in view of conditions on the market for political magazines is an exceptional success this clearly did not persuade the members of the delo supervisory board to confirm as responsible editor of mag an editor who had already proved to be successful in fact they initially offered this position to him but deferred the appointment when he submitted his programme meanwhile the president of the supervisory board andrijana starina kosem and vice president stojan zdol ek exercised politically motivated pressure on him commented on several contributions and interviews and demanded a different political content in particular they were upset by articles on dubious managerial buy outs of companies about about turns in the sova affair interviews with president of lds katarina kresal and koper mayor boris popovi and questions a journalist posed to izola mayor tomislav kloko ovnik prior to the an interview and then demanded that the interview deal with them starina kosem told urla that tycoons are good for slovenia and that in mag they should blame the prime minister janez jan a most for inflation and not the mercator chain of shops she even demanded that we write articles critical of the jan a government andrijana starina kosem and stojan zdol ek thus wanted to exploit the magazine mag for their own political and business interests as well as the interests of pivovarna la ko which wished to take over the largest shopping chain mercator in september in fact they had asked urla to write an article in mag on how pivovarna la ko does not abuse its monopoly on the slovene drinks market although some distinguished economists believe otherwise urla of course resisted all these pressures since it was a matter of interference by the supervisory board in the editorial autonomy of mag the last straw was an interview in mag with prime minister janez jan a which had a wide public response in which he apportioned most blame for the disputed sale of mercator to the president of the supervisory board of delo andrijana starina kosem who at that time had been his state secretary and president of the supervisory board of kad capital investment fund on the very day that the aforementioned interview was published the supervisory board held an extraordinary session and published a public call for applications for a new responsible editor of mag the call for applications was a farce since it was known in advance that it was punishment of the editorial staff because it had resisted the pressures and that a candidate would be chosen who would fulfil the wishes of the supervisory board when urla drew public attention to the politically motivated pressures that kosem and zdol ek had exerted on him he was told that he was already out of the running it is also of interest that the selected candidate as new responsible editor of mag veso stojanov is even himself a member of the supervisory board since he represents the employees on it there is therefore no doubt that he would know what kind of content the supervisors wish in the new mag and what kind would no longer be allowed to appear in the magazine stojanov has already announced in some media a change in editorial policy which is supposed to be harmonised with the owners and similarly a strengthening of staff about which the delo publishing house had previously been unwilling to listen it is therefore clear that the editorial changes at mag are above all a political take over of the magazine or in view of the already published opinions of the future responsible editor even a revolutionary take over as journalists on mag we appeal to the slovene public representatives of the state and civil society to support us in the struggle against the political and capital destruction of the weekly magazine the forced diametrically opposed editorial policy will destroy the most important part of what mag has represented ever since its foundation a different view of conditions in society from the prevailing one in the slovene media journalists of mag also have the right to free expression under the law constitution and international conventions and our faithful readers have the right to an independent weekly magazine

3805115 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

3805133 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3805134 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3805135 im really not a chicken little player but i worry that no one seems to be focusing in on this

3805217 this incident was discussed in my school for many days it made a deep impression on me most of the other students sympathized with the insurrectionists but only from an observers point of view they did not understand that it had any relation to their own lives they were merely interested in it as an exciting incident i never forgot it i felt that the rebels were ordinary people like my own family and i deeply resented the injustice of the treatment given to them
3805218 for the first time i saw and studied with great interest a map of the world

3805225 there are many photographs of mao in patched trousers worn and baggy jackets pockets always deformed by books and papers there are also many reminiscences of interviews with him of their length sometimes lasting all night of maos untiring passion for explanation down to the last detail he would join in the fun of parties laugh at theatricals in photographs he has a habit of not trying to occupy the center of the picture anna louise strong has left us a charming word picture of mao dancing to a timing of his own he is not a good dancer of children running in and out of his cave while he worked there is a kind of childish impish gaiety about mao but it can change into deadly seriousness in a second in speaking he has a way of presenting a most complicated subject so that even the uneducated man can understand it he never talks above the heads of his audience but he never talks down to them either there is a real flow of intimacy between him and the people he always seems to be in contact
3805226 the chinese revolution is great but the road after revolution will be longer the work greater and more arduous

3805233 russian aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance

3805241 its not that uncommon for the spouse of a seriously ill person to commit adultery
3805242 the healthy spouse often feels guilty lonely and helpless about the illness and that combination can make a spouse more vulnerable to having an affair
3805243 i know edwards spoke of his narcissism as a factor but far more than that had to be going on
3805244 his wife took care of him three or four times a week but she was in her 50s and was still a young person
3805245 some cave in and feel victimized and others say screw it and fight and win
3805246 not only are you losing your body parts and vitality but also losing what you perceive to be your dreams your family and your social status
3805247 its very difficult for someone like elizabeth edwards to leave in this situation
3805248 she has a high investment in maintaining that relationship she may submerge a great deal political wives do they have an investment in the political arena as well
3805249 i am not sure what the word forgiveness means but they never forget
3805250 there is something about a lot of the people in power that they think the rules no longer apply to them or theyre above the rules
3805251 they have a sense of entitlement that comes with their prestige or place in the political sphere
3805252 when youre powerful you get away with a lot of things
3805253 and when youre attractive youre given a lot of slack thats just how the world works
3805254 there is a euphoria attached to the relentless feeding of the ego
3805255 the grandiosity in their own mind tends to make them so vain that an illusion of invincibility is created
3805256 if there is no meaningful consequence of what hes done typically change will not happen
3805257 if he loses power or a job or there is legal intervention then he might
3805258 going on television says two things one that he cant hide anymore because he was up against the wall and two that narcissists are always thinking about themselves and their appearance to the audience
3805259 edwards may just be thinking that the best way to preserve his ego is to take some ownership and give his behavior a title by saying hes narcissistic
3805260 by putting a diagnostic label on it might be another way of not taking responsibility
3805261 if sydney were personified shed be bronzed brazen and almost certainly wearing a zimmermann bikini so synonymous has the sunny australian label become with australian style

3805265 i was brought up in kings park in glasgow and from the end of my road you could see hampden park where i launched my football career
3805266 as a youngster confidence is not an issue you just feel you can play to the required standard and tend not to worry about things
3805267 i left school during that time and started work as a sub editor in the sports section of the old bulletin newspaper but as with everybody of my age i was eventually called up for national service
3805268 i was sent to catterick and stayed there for the entire two year duration because i played for the british army team we had a fair side and billy macphail was one of my team mates we had some good games too against luxembourg scotland and england
3805269 another representative side i played for at that time was great britain in the olympic games of 1948 i think im right in saying we finished fourth at wembley there were four or five queens park players in the side as it was a totally amateur outfit
3805270 when i came out of the army later that year i decided i wasnt going back into the newspaper business and turned professional there were a few clubs in for me at that time but i joined third lanark
3805271 i moved on after about six months though to go to newcastle united it was a good decision as in those days they were doing very well within months of me joining they won the fa cup although i was in the reserves and not involved
3805272 so i thought thats my big chance gone but the next season we retained the trophy and i was in the team we beat a very good arsenal side 1 0 in the final it was a great time for me especially as i had only joined the club the year before
3805273 we had a strong team including bobby mitchell and frank brennan playing important roles but the club favourite was undoubtedly jackie milburn i loved my time there as the people really loved their football if anything more so than they do today
3805274 there were crowds of 60 000 regularly crammed into st james park sometimes they had to close the gates three hours before kick off at 12 oclock i have a suite in the stand named after me
3805275 my career was eventually ended by injury but i think those sessions kept me sharp and quite possibly helped to prolong my career for a season or two jock trained you hard and always kept all the players on their toes
3805276 i knew the team celtic were putting together then was going to be a good one jock knew how to blend individuals we had a great rapport but i never once thought in terms of winning european trophies
3805277 we had a lot of talent throughout that side and a great defence as well that didnt lose many goals we had our differences on the park but we always put it behind us when we got off the pitch we all got on well together
3805278 when we got to the european cup final in 1967 it was just something that happened the games we played in the run up to the match with inter milan were just regular games for us when we got to the final it was just another match
3805279 we were all over them and thoroughly deserved to win 2 1 the second picture shows the penalty they scored early on mazzola put the ball to my right and there was nothing i could do about it but my team mates came good in the end as i knew they would
3805280 at one point i got caught about 30 yards off my line when they played a ball through the middle i back heeled it and john clark collected it it all turned out fine but if it had gone wrong i have no idea what would have happened
3805281 the pools panel were looking to have a man in scotland and one of the football reporters at that time john fairgrieve suggested me i got the job and did that for many years
3805282 i have enjoyed working as a matchday host at celtic with some of my fellow lisbon lions and it has been great to see the success the club have enjoyed under martin oneill
3805283 you know why he wiz so good on his right side it wiz because he kept his teeth in his bunnet there nothing ever got by him there

3805288 because he ended up breaking my nose it was an accident of course but i dont think he liked the attention
3805289 cruyff was out of this world in that first game at parkhead the touch he showed to lay off the ball for jesper olsen to score was just incredible
3805290 when billy mcneill originally told me i was down to mark jesper olsen i thought he was winding me up i was hardly in the door and olsen had given danny mcgrain a really hard time in the first leg he said it was his best ever game
3805291 but billy changed his mind in the days before the game and i had to go everywhere with cruyff that suited me because i had my instructions and i knew what to do
3805292 and of course danny mcgrain roasted olsen that night it was difficult to know who was the right back and who was the left winger as olsen just couldnt cope
3805293 and when you find out the two subs they had on the bench
3805294 you realise what a team they had marco van basten and frank rijkaard no less
3805295 when charlie scored that amazing goal we began to think the impossible could happen
3805296 but they equalised and it was looking like we were out
3805297 but we had some terrific players too like charlie murdo george danny big pat bonner and one of our subs that night was davie moyes it was a great night and ill never forget it

3805314 i lost my parents i lost both my parents the living was getting worse people killing people starving we decided to go to egypt
3805315 we went all of us me my aunt and my two sisters and my brother as a matter of fact theyre still in egypt
3805316 for the younger generation its awfully difficult just to go to school for young people when you graduate you go to the army and fight thats all a lot of people are missing school down there and only a few people get chances to go to other countries
3805317 i came to the u s for a better life
3805318 sudanese forward teeng akol a 6 foot 10 specimen made his national debut with our savior new american last weekend at the national prep tip off and it was a good one
3805319 akol is a legitimate player on the perimeter is a slender athlete and has a touch though not nearly as strong as he needs to be akol has the talent and upside needed to attract major college suitors
3805320 ive improved a lot while at img and understand the game a lot better
3805321 it was great working out and practicing with pros and college players ive improved in strength and mentally they taught me to make the game easier and itll help me at the next level
3805322 he recruited me last year and i know him a long time ago when he was at umass
3805323 thats why i felt like he knows my game i know him a long time ago so i feel like he can make me better
3805324 we love him and we were developing a great relationship unfortunately usf was not the right fit for him we will do everything to we can to make sure he ends up at the right institution and we wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors
3805325 hes helped me with a lot of things schoolwork he really helped me with a lot of things
3805326 me and the coaches and staff everybody is new were looking to do great things for oklahoma state im looking to do my best to put them on the map
3805327 i wouldnt say he was careless but he knew where he was going
3805328 i really feel for him hayden he was lying there in the hospital with no one for three quarters of an hour
3805329 i thought oh yeah thats hayden he will have broken his leg or something
3805330 they wanted to do it sooner than we did but we held off
3805331 its the hardest thing to watch your kid die at least we had the chance to say goodbye
3805332 i was always at him to do it up properly
3805333 hed had his battles but things were finally coming right for him
3805334 weve got some wonderful communities and its all about these visitors experiencing that real community feel
3805335 then i knocked on the window of the house and opened the front door and just yelled at them to get out
3805336 the older woman couldnt hold on to cup she was so upset
3805337 im not a hero i just did what i did
3805338 there was about 10 minutes of ads then the tv went boomph
3805339 everyone involved was distressed at the timing of the glitch
3805340 how do i insert a newline into a regexp or the replacement string
3805341 he believes that narcolepsy is attributable to an inability to suppress rem sleep during waking
3805342 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3805343 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3805344 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3805345 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3805346 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3805347 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3805348 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3805349 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3805350 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3805351 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3805352 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3805353 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3805354 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3805368 the perception that we played a slower style under sendek isnt right
3805369 i want to play fast i want to be aggressive but i dont want to be reckless
3805370 clearly the lifeblood of any program is recruiting and we need to do a good job with that
3805371 but its a lot easier to know something can happen when it has happened before
3805372 i have a truly marvellous proof of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain
3805373 i think the first time we had a multiplayer match with our test group and everything came together it was a ton of fun as its a multiplayer centric game even though its single player game too but when you get eight players together and throwing big red rubber balls at each other including trash talking it doesnt get much better than that
3805374 the multiplayer is a big component and the fact we have three different dodgeball modes there are a lot of different customization options to use also there are four teams we are shipping with zombies robots pirates and ninjas each team will schematically tie to a level and will have a story of their own to play through that is tongue in cheek each will come with their own cut scenes too
3805375 yeah we definitely at first we had quite a bit of e mails and still to this day we have e mails asking when the game is coming out but as of late we have fell of radar because there hasnt been much buzz or talk about it we kind of fell of the map because we were going through certification trying to figure out the best release date but coming up youll definitely see more announcements regarding the game
3805376 its passed certification and its waiting to be released at this point i think what microsoft offers is pretty transparent we knew from the very beginning when we first got into it what the tcr requirements were and all that and i know that a lot of other developers sort of complained a bit microsofts tcr is fairly workable and they have a lot of interpretations and will usually work with you regarding the tcrs that can be interpreted different ways the development team is already familiar with the tcr policy and it was all planned for at the beginning thats the key too not many developers really plan for the commission conference and they dont plan for meeting certain guidelines or requirements if you plan from the very beginning youll be better off
3805377 we are looking forward to early september and at 800 points
3805378 yeah we do its something in the future i want to see i definitely want to see future pvn games i could totally see a puzzle fighter style game with pvn its sort of the action based genre thats character based maybe sports pretty much a team aspect of it although you know i definitely want to see more genres the sky is the limit for pvn
3805379 there were tidbits thrown about at e3 but we cant officially confirm anything yet
3805380 its not a part of the shipping game but itll be for downloadable content we cant mention the name or who they are yet but they are certainly are an icon and a part of gaming when they do release theyll come with their own level and story we think people will get a kick out of it very cool team cool visuals and really cool level as a matter of fact its one of my favorite levels
3805381 im hoping to get it done within the month of the games release
3805382 i think in terms of what people have said about gamecock and how they are very hands off developer is that its all true none of it is hyperbole and its all very much true
3805383 you have to do it this way or that way
3805384 i cant speak on that yet but i can confirm that we are an official ps3 developer and wii developer
3805385 kids will find another way to compete its sort of the nature of growing up nature of humanity you could almost say cops and robbers cowboys and indians have been going on forever i think its kind silly
3805386 im kind of a more of a pirate fan i love the ninjas but i think their weak i like rum too so i think im more on the pirate side
3805387 you know what if players want an experience the keeps on giving a multiplayer game lets say a game that you dont play for a few hours and put down then pvn is the right choice its the kind of fun that has unlimited assort of gameplay a lot of customization options for matches with beautiful graphics and really cool dodgeball gameplay its a one of a kind experience on xbox live arcade youre not going to play anything like it and players will have the chance to finally figure out whats better pirates or ninjas or zombies or robots
3805388 i think so too the game is fun and the story is really funny its light hearted but its the multiplayer thats going to keep people coming back for more thats where we see live arcade thats the type of games we want to make were not into the single player experience where you play for a few hours and put the game down were into the online multiplayer where players can keep coming back and feel like they are getting their moneys worth
3805389 ive been goin to colandreas since i was 3 im 28 now and the food is still always fresh and delicious ive never had a problem with anything there god
3805390 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
3805391 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
3805392 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors

3805397 being so lean for so many years makes you creative but it is also like living on an oxygen tank if you turned it off now we will not be able to be sustainable
3805398 some are under the impression that we can just up the ante and hold another fundraiser
3805399 the good news is we love our news department our educational programs and our workforce
3805400 the difference is how we will continue to pay for it
3805401 forty years ago this structure made sense for the state but not today
3805402 the new organizational structure will give njn the flexibility to lease some if its licenses to generate new revenues to help fund operations and modernize equipment all proceeds gained from these business arrangements will be channeled right back to the organization to provide economic sustainability and encourage growth

3805667 i told them curses against the lecturers dont apply because we know the counter spell
3805668 it was a very explicit spell from a woman against a man that said every time he makes love make his penis hurt
3805669 the ones you want to attract people now those are mostly done by men who want to get the girl they wanted to have a sexual relationship with them mostly
3805670 others are done by women who want to preserve the love of their partner
3805671 its not just fanciful they have to give parallels from around the world like what is the purpose or who is the god they are asking you dont make up anything
3805672 the purpose of it is therapeutic you write it down you get it out of your system
3805673 in some ways its like all humanity subjects we offer them the opportunity to develop their academic skills but we do it by using an interesting topic i guess its the kind of topic that appeals to people who might not do religious studies
3805674 that sort of concern would be brought on by a misunderstanding of what we are doing we are not advocating witchcraft we are putting it into an historical context
3805675 property values continue to fall across the country with almost all areas now showing values lower than they were 12 months ago
3805676 the market is now well off its peak of late 2007 and early 2008 with many sellers accepting the state of the market and dropping their expectations accordingly
3805677 i just tried to black out the whole thing it was bad
3805678 i was terrified for my girls if they hadnt been here it would have been a different kettle of fish i just thought if i pass out i wont be able to look after my girls
3805679 he grabbed my left hand put it down on the bench and started slowly pushing the knife into my hand
3805680 he was very calm he was very collected he wasnt looking sideways he didnt look nervous we thought it must have been a case of mistaken identity
3805681 a scumbag like this comes into your house and does this to you whether he gets caught or not its a small price to pay for the amount of terror he has caused in a neighbourhood
3805682 ive been through some pretty hairy things in the past and im not afraid of dying its just my wife and my family we are going to light this house up like a christmas tree now i dont want to be outside after dark anymore

3805684 he was hunched over but when he straightened up you could see what i think was the intestines
3805685 i was worried about him he was saying that two guys jumped him
3805686 he was only here less than 10 minutes what he told me was that he was going to go home and get his mother to take him to hospital
3805687 the pictures arent the clearest but you can see the wound quite clearly

3805798 no tiene que ir m s all de lo que los ciudadanos pagan para entrar a actuaciones musicales en las propias fiestas
3805799 no lo vimos mal lo vimos como una oportunidad para que la ciudadan a asumiese un nuevo espacio urbano como propio pero hay una condici n previa y es que al ayuntamiento no se le incremente el presupuesto de las fiestas
3805800 la situaci n econ mica no est para hacer nuevos dispendios tanto m s cuando el alcalde juan alberto belloch prometi que las fiestas no supondr an un incremento de partida ni un d ficit de costes

3805804 we dont know that they were illegal if they were contributions from the campaign then obviously theres some issues there with legality but at this point were still trying to investigate that
3805805 and if you take that money that people have contributed to you based upon the fact that they think their money is going to a presidential candidate and you give it to a girlfriend of a god knows what thats a crime but the question is how do you prove that and she was somehow working for the campaign as its videographer so was the money she got so inappropriately more than what she deserved thats going to be the issue the feds are going to have to look at it would be a federal offense

3805808 has also confirmed that edwards secretly visited rielle and their love child three separate times at the beverly hilton hotel in los angeles this year enquirer reporters caught edwards 55 making a late night visit to 44 year old rielle and their daughter at the hotel on july 21
3805809 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself

3805811 weve probably got our tougher matches to come and we need to work hard in them as well
3805812 any result 10 0 is pretty big it is good its always good to get a big win
3805813 its tough for us but we feel that were very fit at the moment and i think thats taken the toll on the other team
3805814 the more we can push harder i think its making the other team struggle a lot more
3805815 we worked very hard in perth at the heat chamber at the ais there

3805823 there were only five venture backed ipos in the first quarter of this year and zero in q2 something we havent seen since 1978
3805824 that kind of market can be challenging for venture capital companies like harris amp harris which primarily invests in nanotechnology and cleantech companies
3805825 at last report the companys balance sheet showed cash per share worth less than a penny per share
3805826 but that is highly misleading as it does not include the companys sizable 53 59 million investment in highly liquid u s treasuries amounting to 2 30 per share on its balance sheet as of the end of the first quarter
3805827 at press time its stock was tracking under 6 00 after setting three new 52 week lows this month bottoming out at 4 97 this means the value of tinys stock has reached near parity with the firms last reported net asset value of 5 85
3805828 with the ipo markets currently closed and investors risk averse for speculative new issues harris amp harris needs to buy time for its portfolio companies
3805829 this helps explain why the firm decided to raise an additional 14 39 million from institutional and private investors in a private placement last month issuing shares at a discount of over 18 to the traded price

3805837 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3805838 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces who have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3805839 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected
3805840 all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
3805841 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis

3805935 the book evolved out of the images memorabilia and stories that partly developed from the soho road to punjab exhibition
3805936 for one the retro audience who are now in their 30s and 40s and were the youth who were present at the live music events during the heydays of bhangra in the 80s young people who are into british asian music but might not know the history and importance of bhangra music since the 60 and 70s it can also be used at an academic level where gcse a level and university students on media and cultural studies courses can draw on it as a resource in their studies as well the general reader interested in aspects of british bhangra music and its industry
3805937 bhangra has really forged a path for itself through the years and nowadays it is commonplace to hear its influence in many mainstream songs such as the remixed version of mundian to bach ke which has leading hip hop artist rapping on it clearly british bhangra music has evolved in the uk from its folk beginnings in the punjab i simply wanted to recreate the journey bhangra has embarked on over the years and i hope the end product is an experience worth sharing with others
3805938 i think this fascinating tale about bhangra musics journey would provide mainstream as well as south asian audiences a means through which they can find out about the origins of bhangra how it has evolved in the uk and its relevance to the music scene today

3805940 chinas leaders know the development of green buildings is a critical need and the olympic village can serve as a model for this development
3805941 with this award the olympic village is being recognized for its contributions to making this years olympics the greenest ever
3805942 on day one we were given instructions in terms of implementing a green agenda
3805943 there was a general objective that this was the green olympics so we had to consider energy conservation and water recycling but in terms of details it was up to designers to come up with solutions
3805944 the water cube is very much a green building because of the way the buildings features work it had inherent advantages of saving energy and also retaining and recycling rainwater
3805945 china is going through a green push and theres a lot of buildings that have these elements water recycling maximizing natural light etc its all moving in that direction

3805970 we saw his goal and were proud that he and brad are doing well
3805971 he knows what its like to wear that galaxy uniform
3805972 when you have two teams in the same building people look at that
3805973 were looking at the three points its a good game for the fans
3805974 few if any new steeples of this size are raised these days
3805975 the churchs past is invaluable from an archival standpoint it testifies to such an impressive length of time and has witnessed so many landmark events moments and individuals in history that it is impossible not to appreciate its accumulated historic cache but the churchs value far exceeds its longevity its mission today to serve those in need is a close reflection of its original mission 344 years ago which is just as urgent now as it was then the church continues to be a place of comfort and a force for positive change in the community and region as it always was and that is where its true value lies
3805976 mental health and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents globally have received little research attention even though mental health problems are one of the most significant contributors to the global burden of disease
3805977 little is known about the efficacy of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflicts in low and middle income settings childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability
3805978 no changes were found on the other outcome variables traumatic idioms depressive anxiety symptoms and functioning the latter for boys we hypothesize that these results may show that psychosocial interventions alone are unable to reverse the challenges to psychosocial well being presented by chronic poverty and political instability
3805979 in short a school based psychosocial intervention was able to moderately reduce ptsd symptoms retain hope and improve functioning for girls and retain hope for boys affected by communal violence in a low income context
3805980 further adaptations and research to address the full range of post traumatic outcomes and functioning are necessary
3805981 we all want this movie to go into production as soon as possible its a fast tracked movie lionsgate felt the process was enhanced by having a second team come in and do a script

3805986 concept genesis coupe is the most thrilling most emotional hyundai yet
3805987 when it hits the market in early 2009 we aim to deliver a driving experience that challenges cars like infiniti g37 at prices more like mitsubishi eclipse
3805988 the mission for concept genesis coupe was to create a pure performance car with a design that would capture the imagination of hardcore automotive enthusiasts
3805989 with its aggressive look from just about any angle i think we have been able to do that
3805990 beauty and danger co exist in the design of the concept genesis coupe
3805991 when viewed from a distance the car is beautiful to look at but up close it can appear a bit menacing and even a little intimidating
3805992 symbolize the spirit of flight and soaring above it all
3805993 over 350 horsepower as applied to the executive car shown in these new spy snaps
3805994 concept genesis extends our product range into new territories from a performance design and packaging perspective
3805995 when it arrives in 2008 it will catapult hyundai into competition against some potent rivals and genesis is up for the challenge
3805996 concept genesis is a manifestation of hyundais extraordinary desire to deliver world class products across all model segments
3805997 with genesis weve got a unique product position an all new highly capable rear wheel drive platform a high performance powertrain and premium progressive design all at a price starting well under 30 000
3805998 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
3805999 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
3806000 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
3806001 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
3806002 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
3806003 our focus right now is on getting gasoline production to return and to get product into our sites any other issues that we have to address well look at down the line
3806004 it would be inconceivable to expect any refiner to have multimillions of dollars of extra plant sitting idle to await those rare occurrences
3806005 it was my goal for there to be nothing stereotypical except for when the story demands that hes momentarily specifically stereotypical for which the actual black man puts him in his place
3806006 so the funny thing about this in retrospect looking at how we did this and decisions that were made and all that is that i remember that we had discussions and then the talk is over and youre out there shooting a movie and so my idea was to try and be natural and entertaining
3806007 my faith is in hope staying hopeful in spite of all the ups and downs of life
3806008 thats not to say i havent shaken my fist at the sky especially when i got breast cancer
3806009 it took a long time but i met another wonderful man it taught me firsthand that the heart is an accordion it keeps opening up
3806010 it was great because the women loved the romance and the relationships and the men loved the sex and violence
3806011 and i thought well thats kind of a clich but im glad theres something in there for everybody
3806012 i love the fact that these creatures are struggling for assimilation i can relate to that in certain ways

3806017 we are aggressively going after our tenants that are following behind on their payments
3806018 we think this underscores best buys strong working relationship with
3806019 in addition we believe the iphone will help grow traffic and sales in this years holiday season which could be weak overall on slowed consumer spending
3806020 i cannot begin to understand why anyone would want to build an eyesore like this in their back garden
3806021 it is not in keeping with the properties in this area its like building an asda supermarket in the middle of a beauty spot
3806022 the gym is not my taste but my husband and two sons love it
3806023 the biggest challenge for open source or any other kind of software development for that matter is finding the right information to solve a problem adding automatic hardware tagging to our search data not only improves the relevance of our support but also gives it developers the most reliable information faster and with the analytical tools to make the right decision based on their exact environment no phone calls into support no trouble tickets just search on your desktop
3806024 our innovations in search technology combined with our sophisticated data gathering and diagnostics tools free technologists from waiting on hold for minutes or hours for support
3806025 a clean desk is a sign of a sick mind
3806026 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted toward men with genetically similar odours
3806027 it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3806028 we will continue to invest in the underlying hypervisor as a core enabling technology esxi embodies our latest technology it has the attribute of having a very small footprint and its very easy to deploy we think that there are many more people who can benefit from that technology
3806029 you can just get esxi and use it and we dont require you to say you have to move up to windows 2008 or introduce a new operating system in your data center to get to virtualization hypervisors at the end of the day are just enabling technologies but customers want full solutions and they want the benefits of what they can build on top of the hypervisor the customers who want to do those things buy our virtual infrastructure which helps them build on top of the hypervisor
3806030 in the last six months the virtualization field has changed a lot with citrix systems buying xensource and microsoft coming out with hyper v
3806031 a few years ago if customers had the esx hypervisor for 500 it wasnt a bad deal now we recognize that a bare metal hypervisor is basically worth zero or close to it i think vmware realizes that as a bare metal hypervisor becomes an essentially free commodity and virtualization becomes increasingly ubiquitous this is how you stay alive
3806032 asbestos insulation milled from ore originating at the karst mine is known as karstolite and has been found in several structures in bozeman helena and livingston
3806033 an undetermined number of homes and commercial buildings built before 1960 may contain the insulation we want to make sure the public is aware of this possibility and if someone finds karstolite in their home or business that they take proper precautions for handling asbestos
3806034 if you think you have found asbestos ore in your yard park or near hiking trails do not disturb or transport the soil yourself contact the deq or refer to our website for more information

3806062 seized a georgian military base and also held onto ground in western georgia maintaining control of the town of zugdidi
3806063 russia accused georgia of killing more than 2000 people mostly civilians in south ossetia
3806064 because large areas of georgia are too dangerous for journalists to enter to assess the true scope of the damage

3806074 the war in georgia is a war for the west

3806109 our own observatory at armagh is one of the oldest in the world and has been observing solar cycles for more than 200 years what this work has shown is that over all of this time short and intense cycles coincide with global warmth and long and weak cycles coincide with cooling most recently this pattern continued in the 1980s and 1990s when cycles 21 and 22 were short less than 10 years and intense and it was notably hot but all this now looks set to change cycle 23 which hasnt finished yet looks like it will be long at least 12 to 13 years and cycle 24 which has still to start looks like it will be exceptionally weak based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years of course nothing in science is certain perhaps though i doubt it armaghs old measurements are wrong or perhaps there are now other factors such as co2 emissions which may change things somewhat however temperatures have already fallen by about 0 5 degrees c over the past 12 months and if this is only the start of it it would be a serious concern northern ireland is not noted for extreme warmth at the best of times and has much more to fear from cold weather than it does from hot we really need to be sure what is going to happen before spending too much money on combating global warming we may need all the money we can save just to help us keep warm david watt brentwood essex
3806110 the sad truth is that it often takes a series of miracles to gain access to post conviction dna testing our criminal justice system is too fraught with error to rely on miracles to find the truth post conviction dna testing serves the interests of fairness accuracy and public confidence in the criminal justice system and states should make every effort to facilitate testing for defendants claiming innocence

3806136 this really shows how phony the mental health exception is for these late term abortions this couple was relieved to be able to keep their baby and would have suffered mentally and emotionally from the loss of their daughter
3806137 there is no way that abortion would have met the legal standard of substantial and irreversible impairment to the mothers mental health if this pregnancy continued this is evidence that tiller and his cohorts continue to manufacture bogus mental health excuses in order to keep profiting from expensive late term abortions that are clearly illegal

3806189 when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3806190 i think that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3806191 so the fact that the cost of borrowing money has dropped over the last 10 days has had limited impact
3806192 basically we have a situation where all of the term deposits are rolling over at the moment at a higher rate of around 150 200 basis points and all of the long term funding we are rolling over at a higher rate

3806528 people are being hit in the pocketbook with these price increases but they have room to trim they are cutting back on discretionary spending and hanging on to durable goods longer not running out and buying a new fridge or washer and dryer
3806529 i had a client trade a pickup truck for a mazda miata he went from a gas hog to a very economical car to drive so we see a lot of that trend happening right now
3806530 over the past few years families looked for new ways to bridge the gap between slow income growth and rapidly rising prices especially for houses but also for food energy and health care
3806531 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir j m keynes
3806532 weve been clear about the current threat for the last six months the threat is high in certain parts of northern ireland
3806533 but theyre badly disrupted theyre marginalised theyre fighting with each other so they are not at the same level and they dont have the capacity in our judgement to carry out an outrage on the scale of omagh
3806534 but they still pose a threat to the public and to the police
3806535 their focus is clear they are determined to kill a police officer they are focused on killing a police officer and that is where our efforts are going
3806536 it started bothering me at the beginning of the match
3806537 i thought i played well i definitely felt like i was in control when i relaxed and played my game
3806538 everyone wants to go to heaven everyone wants to believe there is a place for them there everyone wants to go to heaven but no one wants it to be their turn
3806539 sometimes i think im wiser for it the years teach much which the days never knew thats ralph waldo emerson but other times i just feel like im lonelier for it
3806540 death is not the greatest of evils it is worse to want to die and not be able to
3806541 there is something that makes it worth it all though
3806542 showing people that life is worth it its easy to forget that sometimes
3806543 because we all sit around fearing death and pushing it out of our minds because its something weve never done it before but death isnt the greatest loss in life the greatest loss is those things that die in us while were living
3806544 the northern ireland act 1998 requires designated public authorities to have due regard to the need to promote equality

3806548 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent

3806555 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3806556 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3806557 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems

3806573 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials because they were perceived by the russians as green lines basically but this one was very strong
3806574 what i expected specifically from america was to secure our airport and to secure our seaports
3806575 the main thing now is that the georgian tbilisi airport will be permanently under control

3806600 we simply do not want to spend the money and resources to host these entries
3806601 the vimeo staff has decided that we are no longer going to allow gaming videos on vimeo specifically we are no longer going to allow game walk throughs game strategy videos depictions of player vs player battles raids fraps or any other video gaming videos that simply depict individuals playing a video game videos falling into this category will be subject to deletion as of september 1st new videos of this type will be removed
3806602 vimeo staff does not feel that videos which are direct captures of video game play truly constitute creative expression
3806603 again vimeo is making no claims that we are deleting these videos because they are
3806604 vimeo is a thriving community of people who love to make and share video from simple moments to masterpieces vimeo is the perfect home for you to upload store and share all the video you create your videos quality and security is important to us and that is why weve built advanced privacy options sharing tools and high quality video encoding so whether you are an amateur filmmaker proud mom restaurant critic or just a guy with a cellphone connect with vimeo today
3806605 one of the things we think defines vimeo and differentiate it from youtube is the humanity were not sure game videos advance that idea
3806606 this decision is not going to be overturned as stated in the blog post a major reason is that we simply do not want to spend the money and resources to host these videos that alone is reason enough
3806607 gaming videos are by nature significantly larger and longer than any other genre on vimeo over these last few months they have been the single biggest reasons for our transcoder wait times
3806608 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3806609 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3806610 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3806611 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3806612 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3806613 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3806614 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3806615 who are open to doing something on the production side
3806616 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3806617 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3806618 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3806619 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3806620 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3806621 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3806622 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3806623 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3806624 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3806625 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3806626 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3806627 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3806628 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

3806630 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3806631 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3806632 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3806633 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3806634 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3806635 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3806636 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3806637 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3806638 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3806639 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3806640 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3806641 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3806642 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3806643 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3806644 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3806645 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3806646 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3806647 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3806648 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3806649 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3806650 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3806651 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3806652 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3806653 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3806654 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3806655 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3806656 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3806657 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3806658 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3806659 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3806660 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3806661 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3806662 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3806663 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3806664 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3806665 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3806666 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3806667 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3806668 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3806669 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3806670 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3806671 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3806672 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3806673 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3806674 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3806675 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3806676 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3806677 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3806678 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3806679 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3806680 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3806681 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3806682 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3806683 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3806684 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3806685 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3806686 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3806687 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3806688 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3806689 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3806690 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3806691 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3806692 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3806693 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3806698 a senior bush administration counterterrorism official said tuesday that an analysis of public statements by al qaeda in the past year shows that nearly half the verbiage is devoted to justifying the groups legitimacy
3806699 have devoted nearly half their airtime to defending the groups legitimacy
3806700 this defensive tone continues a trend observed since at least last summer and reflects concern over allegations by militant leaders and religious scholars that al qaeda and its affiliates have violated the islamic laws of war particularly in iraq and north africa

3806726 they get a positive experience being at a small rural school and because there are fewer students we can cater to their needs
3806727 they give a lot of time to drive them to training and tournaments
3806728 i was very surprised to wake up i was disappointed
3806729 i want to go before i have another stroke its time for me

3806731 voluntary euthanasia is for people still cognitive i cant see that anyone else should be involved it could be open to abuse but if the law covers it properly it shouldnt be abused
3806732 ill try and get this recommended and supported while i am able id like to live to see the law decriminalised
3806733 i was pretty gutted because it was the second car that ive had stolen
3806734 the car was ready to run but i had taken bits out so it wouldnt run so it couldnt get stolen
3806735 here we go again another fight with the council to keep our boards
3806736 the district council has never believed in the worth of community boards we work exceptionally hard for our communities
3806737 but shes never acknowledged the worth of the community boards in the past shes described us as a thorn in the councils side but were the eyes and ears of the smaller communities i challenge her and the rest of the council to accept that
3806738 i certainly hope this is the case someone has to take care of the issues at a local level we all work very hard
3806739 but my criticism was based on my opinion that we should be using every opportunity to secure funding for the council
3806740 i cant see why thing should be any different when it comes to roading
3806741 theres no other intersection in new plymouth with approach speeds that low
3806742 thats the huge irony with this intersection everyone knows it is very difficult so they treat it accordingly
3806743 and thats the challenge for the council we dont want to do anything to the intersection that would make it less safe we all know that at present it is unsatisfactory but it isnt unsafe
3806744 mi chiedevo da molti giorni perch i media avessero chiuso i battenti ancora una volta sulla straordinaria persona di francesco nuti e come sempre ci ricordassero le cose spiacevoli o le sue naturali e umane debolezze

3806753 anyone who says prison life is easy is either not telling the truth or has never been inside to have a good look

3806758 there were some 10 pepi and tamariki combined in there but the babies were not separated from the older toddlers
3806759 we trusted the centre to look after our baby and this happens
3806760 they say our baby is a minor and they cant do anything
3806761 we were told to go to the ministry of education to lay charges
3806762 if so then maybe the management should decide to close the centre for a while instead of putting our kids in danger
3806763 although the offending did not take place at the college the decision to go to police was taken on the basis that our first and foremost priority has to always be the protection of potentially vulnerable children and young people
3806764 no system would have predicted or prevented this type of offending
3806765 their mother got to new zealand within 48 hours of being contacted she was absolutely shocked
3806766 the school did the right thing to contact police and dealt with it very well
3806767 anything like that is damaging i suspect there will be a fallout back in the students home country

3806811 all wars are civil wars because all men are brothers each one owes infinitely more to the human race than the particular country in which he was born
3806812 the paradox of hospitality is that it wants to create emptiness not a fearful emptiness but a friendly emptiness where strangers can enter and discover themselves as free free to sing their own songs speak their own languanges dance their own dances free also to leave and follow their own vocations

3806821 la nostra politica enuncia moro proprio in quanto solo paese che sia stato sin qui in grado di conservare rapporti diplomatici con tutti i paesi arabi stata sempre quella di facilitare il ritorno degli occidentali negli stati da cui erano stati estromessi e quindi auspichiamo una politica che rafforzi la presenza dei nostri alleati
3806822 oggi pi che mai prosegue moro si tratta di agire con discrezione puntando ogni sforzo su metodi politici economici e comunque di apertura verso quelle ragionevoli richieste di forniture anche militari purch eseguite con discrezione
3806823 noi abbiamo regolarmente e di recente anche i francesi fatto toccare i porti tunisini da nostre unit navali ma se vedremmo con favore visite da parte di unit della marina turca non potremmo non avere riserve di fronte ad affacciarsi di unit britanniche e americane che mentre sul momento potrebbero dare soddisfazione a bourghiba non tarderebbero a rivelarsi unarma controproducente sostanziando i sospetti che tripoli nutre nei confronti dei due predetti paesi

3806829 ha rilevato che i progressisti arabi intendono fare del petrolio di cui hanno le pi grandi riserve la loro arma per ricattare loccidente di fronte a questi dichiarati propositi gli riuscivano incomprensibili le esitazioni occidentali nel far leva sulliran sia aumentando le importazioni di grezzo sia rafforzandone leconomia

3806945 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture

3806947 if you were to run out on the harbour bridge in rush hour you could have someone go into the back of you theres also the inconvenience factor because you have to get someone to bring petrol out to you
3806948 its a very false economy and in some cases you actually increase your costs
3806949 while we understand that filling up with higher petrol prices is hurting peoples wallets it is a false economy not to do so
3806950 the lower you run your petrol the more damage you are doing to the tank
3806951 it lets the pump run dry and that will do some damage to it
3806952 the brushes within the pump can spark its a very long shot but there have been instances when its happened
3806953 the fact is you are using the petrol anyway you would be better filling up the tank than going every time and just putting 20 in
3806954 i think its probably more expensive because theres more weight
3806955 i put in 20 yesterday just so i could make it to the petrol station today and use my fuel dockets to fill it right up

3806960 people have raised concerns about whether the decision was lawful in all respects
3806961 that is potentially something we would look at either because it is of concern to us or because people have complained i would not be surprised if we get formal complaints or it may be something we decide to look into
3806962 one issue seems to be that there were five properties purchased and the council treated them as separate decisions and there is concern that they did that to avoid rules on significance and whether they should consult
3806963 the 5 million is a guide and the council was not going to lose this opportunity
3806964 it is only a policy it is only for guidance council still had the right to say this is an opportunity we do not want to lose and so we will make the decision and not consult
3806965 there was a creditor meeting and council was concerned that the properties may be broken up
3806966 mr henderson may have lost control of the sites and a mortgagee could have taken control of them that was the urgency
3806967 i am not worried about the process i am told the auditor general the ombudsman have been notified and i am even told we will be taken to court i am happy to defend the process council followed
3806968 it is up to the councillors to decide if they have enough information and time to make an informed decision and there was no one saying they did not

3806977 the north pacific gyre is a clockwise rotating mass of water roughly twice the size of the u s where currents and winds slow down its like a toilet bowl that never flushes
3806978 we want to gently educate about the problem and get consumers to move toward re usables
3806979 the best solution now is to try to prevent the problem from getting any worse

3807021 three trees fell in high winds last week endangering nearby homes and that the top of one tree crashed through the window of an occupied room at the retirement village causing substantial damage
3807022 an inspection of both groves of trees shows that no trees fell at all a branch not the top of a tree did fall on the road at the retirement village and did break a window which would appear to be minor damage and that is not disputed

3807027 there may be some cannibalism but i can see this for people who live a distance from an apple store or for those who prefer best buy for one reason or another
3807028 to go global which apple wants to do they have to go through a lot of various channels
3807029 apple doesnt need to actually sell at its stores for those stores to be important
3807030 im really beginning to think that the store network plays a big part in the sales process even if people buy an apple product somewhere else they know they can take it to an apple store if they need help or need it fixed
3807031 the university of oxford has no record of mr ali kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university
3807032 professor edmund rolls professor peter bryant and professor alan cowey have all at some stage held posts at the university of oxford however none of them work in the field of law and none of them would sign degree certificates
3807033 no longer existed except through the hatreds french people bore one another
3807034 go into the street and you see what the country is
3807035 everything is there the street is like the face of a man
3807036 mother it is because to the north of me are the tamils and to the south the sea how can i stretch myself out in such circumstances
3807037 they implied the dumb inanimate sea and the roguish tamils
3807038 when i was young in the early 1970s people were paying no attention to procedure and law it was just weve got power now and we will do things as we want the point was simply to uproot the system this was the purpose of the 1972 constitution it concentrated authority in the executive the independence constitution implemented in 1947 had certain essential features the full separation of powers full checks and balances and most of these were eliminated in 1972 the courts had no authority to rule on the validity of laws enacted by the legislature so parliament had the liberty of a wild ass as the expression went that is why everything eventually became political and corruption spread so widely
3807039 how could this happen because people were politically na ve they talked politics all the time but they were not politically literate feelings were what moved them nationalist feelings and then racist and religious feelings
3807040 then the police and the army then the civil service and then the judiciary
3807041 historically they have shown themselves to be a greedy group and they have done little in terms of inward capital investment some retail tenants have been given a 35 percent increase this year but kerikeri may not continue to be the cash cow for them that it has been in the past it is surely preferable to work with good tenants and ensure businesses remain viable than have empty sites with no return on investment
3807042 while development in waipapa is having an impact what is happening is that kerikeri is developing a niche for high quality products
3807043 the market determines the rent on average kerikeri rents have been less than the rate of inflation in recent years shops are empty because people are running scared at present because of the current economic situation
3807044 we were going to review our rents in july but we have left them at their current rates
3807045 some landlords charge even more which explains why their properties are empty
3807046 frankly i think thats disgusting honestly theyre seven and nine years old so young
3807047 i find it sad that they ruined an otherwise pretty awesome ceremony with those fakes
3807048 so forget beijing 2008 best opening ceremony so far is still sydney 2000 they didnt see it necessary to use computer generated images to impress the world
3807049 apparently the little girl whose voice was used yang peiyi wasnt cute enough it was deemed bad for chinas image to show a little girl with crooked teeth
3807050 something about passing over a child for crooked teeth just seems well wrong
3807051 the song was pre recorded the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
3807052 people have raised concerns about whether the decision was lawful in all respects
3807053 that is potentially something we would look at either because it is of concern to us or because people have complained i would not be surprised if we get formal complaints or it may be something we decide to look into

3807059 i am not worried about the process i am told the auditor general the ombudsman have been notified and i am even told we will be taken to court i am happy to defend the process council followed
3807060 it is up to the councillors to decide if they have enough information and time to make an informed decision and there was no one saying they did not

3807062 the entire cabinet meeting on a british ship it tells you everything
3807063 father decided to read the bible to confound his enemy
3807064 nothing was happening the church was not responding to social issues it was merely part of the establishment
3807065 i began to realize that the fellowship i didnt find in church was there
3807066 the ordinary man was able to feel he was something somebody
3807067 negombo was called little rome because it had so many churches
3807068 they gave us independence so independence was for the rich boys
3807069 it will be an anglican service but with others too its a mass but in the indigenous way using english sinhala and tamil we use roti instead of bread you break it and you share
3807070 i was three quarters reconnected to christianity when i went and after i felt that i could become a full christian again
3807071 either youre a conformist and religion is your special dope or you make it a means to spur you on to build a new society this is the choice for the religious community sinhalese tamil these divisions must go and we have to be one
3807072 i asked the pastor why not pictures of buddha and confucius men of the east he wouldnt hear of it
3807073 when you go to kandy the temple of the tooth is a must but go to some of the other temples nearby too youll see them there will be many people there including many young people look at their faces
3807074 there is a new kind of coming and going in the world these days
3807075 one of the most notable social welfare measures of independent ceylon
3807076 as long as the sun and moon last the price of a measure of rice will be twenty five cents
3807077 the sanity and good sense of the great majority of citizens of this country has sic been demonstrated already in their refusal to back the call for a political strike today
3807078 august 12th marks the beginning of a new stage in the history of the mass movement of this country that day saw the heroism and solidarity of the masses in common struggle
3807079 during periods of violence people used to set them all the time in this case its impossible to tell what happened but there is something very typical about setting fire to things as an act of revenge or retaliation everything is destroyed after a fire theres nothing left
3807080 an unfortunate incident where a few policemen got drunk and went on a looting spree all on their own
3807081 the kind of thinking and excitement that was there then no longer is
3807082 i wasnt a socialist it was more a matter of private thinking for me what was right what to do a lot of government servants were like this they had personal preferences and opinions but were not involved in things like demonstrations
3807083 you begin to think of your heritage the countrys heritage
3807084 i think of them as big men doing big things big men on a tiny island you should see the streets in anuradhapura theyre huge and theyre still there the reservoirs today theyd need aid from the world bank to build them theyre like seas
3807085 so big men who thought big and did big things
3807086 we delight in killing people were a small country we depend on others we need aid and assistance others have to think for us
3807087 i dont like this notion of third world were big people like everyone else
3807088 its the difference between what we were and what we are now go and look at what weve done
3807089 they had a character then a strong sense of self respect
3807090 everything now is based on earning dollars and having contacts abroad were part of a global system but peoples character and dignity have to be maintained even within a global system
3807091 you think of sinhalese heritage im sinhalese but im thinking of the heritage of this country it so happens that ninety percent of our heritage was built by sinhalese the sinhalese they left a large amount of evidence to show that they were here for good as it were the others never left anything that signified their attachment to this place what have they left nothing they werent concerned about living here they were just traders who went back
3807092 if there is discrimination in this land which is not their homeland then why try to stay here why not go back home where there would be no discrimination there you have your culture your education universities et cetera there you are masters of your own fate it would be advisable for the tamils not to disturb the sleeping sinhalese brother everyone knows that lions when disturbed are not peaceful
3807093 i dont think theres an ethnic crisis even though they call it one its just a terrorist group trying to create disorder the sinhalese and tamils are very friendly people its just not their homeland theyve left no achievements
3807094 before the british came sinhala was the predominant language then they imposed english tamil was also there but it was a minority language the majority language has to be looked after before the minority language can be looked into i dont know why they want to make a big thing of it its common sense if you take your mind away from the political issues
3807095 i hope you didnt misunderstand me i am sri lankan just as much as you are american i love my country as you love yours i spoke about these things only because you asked me
3807096 we do not have loyalty to a system in sri lanka
3807097 we have loyalty to individuals it is the exertion of personality over the system
3807098 it is a case for the anthropologists the institutions were there but then there are the people within them how can one man cause this kind of institutional erosion
3807099 i hate the chief justice but not even he has been successful in undermining law altogether when all is said and done there is law and order
3807100 however judges were appointed once they were appointed they became quite independent
3807101 it tells you about the attitude problems in the system it tells you how dangerous even something like a contempt charge can be made to be it tells you in the end about unlimited power
3807102 i became determined never to do anything simply because thats the way its done i learned to question everything
3807103 the internship was in the mid 1990s when i first became a lawyer and that was such an important time for me i had to study cases and discuss them afterward in chambers i wrote reports and then we would discuss the reports they would call me for long telephone conversations in the evening i saw the workings of the court from the inside and i had an ideal
3807104 i couldnt even call them courts i dreaded them cases postponed cases delayed nobody treating the public with any respect nobody even talking about the law when i started in the supreme court you could still have hope in the supreme court and the appeals court there was a lot of integrity among the justices at least a citizen of sri lanka would be heard he or she would be treated with dignity then i began to see the wider picture the degeneration especially in the lower courts and especially from about 2000 onward after sarath became chief justice was suddenly very real to me there are no proper procedures and even if there are they are not taken seriously there are codes of conduct but nobody knows what happens if they are breached the standards there when i started out are no longer there
3807105 take the question of contempt as in the tony fernando case its not unusual that case in a magistrate court last year there was a defendant in a cell adjoining the courtroom he yawned the judge heard it and he was sentenced to two years for contempt a couple of years ago an opposition m p got a two year sentence for contempt after he allegedly criticized a supreme court decision in a public meeting
3807106 in any country the attitudes and values projected by the head of an institution have a big influence on lower level officials this is what i saw judges started saying i dont want to listen to your case and when you objected he would say are you disputing me i could hold you in contempt this happened to me again and again youre simply not given the opportunity to present your case the basic right to be heard is not there this happens again and again to many attorneys
3807107 we had three clients one was acquitted and two found guilty it was in this case that i finally saw clearly how the system works it was the people at the top who were responsible who were truly guilty and they got off so the guilty were found innocent and the innocent were found guilty i knew immediately it was something i wanted no part of
3807108 there are good strong periods in the lives of these sorts of institutions and there are periods that are less good
3807109 we have some very good judges but there arent many heroes
3807110 this is a very rare and regrettable incident at all times st john has the best interests of patients communities and staff in mind immediate clinical care was provided by the ambulance officers to the injured pedestrian at the scene before he was transported to hospital by another ambulance
3807111 asbs profit result is pleasing in an economy which while slowing and undergoing change remains fundamentally sound
3807112 home lending activity has declined sharply this calendar year although asb has experienced less of a fall in volumes than the market
3807113 we are really investing in the business for the future
3807114 there will be a higher loss ratio in that lending but that is covered by the increased price
3807115 i see it as a reasonable market to operate in it will tick over at a reasonable level of activity certainly not the heady activity that we have enjoyed in the last seven years but that had to slow down
3807116 so i think we are back to a more stable market i am confident that we can continue to grow the business perhaps slightly above the market
3807117 if you were to run out on the harbour bridge in rush hour you could have someone go into the back of you theres also the inconvenience factor because you have to get someone to bring petrol out to you
3807118 its a very false economy and in some cases you actually increase your costs
3807119 while we understand that filling up with higher petrol prices is hurting peoples wallets it is a false economy not to do so
3807120 the lower you run your petrol the more damage you are doing to the tank
3807121 it lets the pump run dry and that will do some damage to it
3807122 the brushes within the pump can spark its a very long shot but there have been instances when its happened
3807123 the fact is you are using the petrol anyway you would be better filling up the tank than going every time and just putting 20 in
3807124 i think its probably more expensive because theres more weight
3807125 i put in 20 yesterday just so i could make it to the petrol station today and use my fuel dockets to fill it right up
3807126 put your cat out and turn your alarm on dumb arse
3807127 the message doesnt seem to be getting home to people lock it or lose it
3807128 please use whatever security you have and it may be as simple as locking the back door or remembering to activate the alarm when you go out
3807129 its simple things like people getting through insecure windows unlocked doors or reaching through catflaps its really basic stuff
3807130 the formica north america performance was well short of expectations us housing starts were down 28 on the prior years and the traditional offset from increased refurbishments did not eventuate
3807131 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
3807132 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf
3807133 is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup
3807134 conrad jantjes is on present form the no 1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100th test cap
3807135 this creates questions about where we are heading i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3807136 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
3807137 is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
3807138 that was the indication i had which is often the way organisations go with a fresh coach coming in
3807139 i look on this as an exciting challenge with a predominantly young team that dave nosworthy has transformed being on the rise
3807140 while not many coaches go from working at international level to the first class arena i see the timing as perfect to move forward again hopefully this will be a stepping stone
3807141 one thing i want you to know one thing that is essential
3807142 one thing its not easy to get healed from the shock of torture inside i mean
3807143 indra traders the car dealer central finance left at k p h the hospital dr fernando mawatha
3807144 we want to change these people this is the object of our animation programs
3807145 we look at many sides of peoples lives health education human rights civil rights self employment meaning how people can do things on their own we have programs for all of these especially in rural areas in estates and villages people are always staying back not going forward
3807146 some children have very good knowledge but are not going forward in school some young people have very good brains but cannot make proper use of their brains
3807147 we teach them math english music and dance sinhala tamil these are children who cant go to private classes for after school tutoring this is expensive but necessary in sri lanka because government schools dont provide a proper education so we take them a hundred of them every saturday
3807148 a lady showed me a tin box and asked me if i had taken some jewelry in it
3807149 she gave me a bun and told me to say yes
3807150 at the police station first they beat the boy with a cane then they tied his legs with rope and hung him from the ceiling upside down then they beat him again he started yelling and screaming the mother had to watch she started shouting too
3807151 they brought him down and he still denied stealing anything at that point they threatened him with a gun then they brought out petrol and said well burn you alive
3807152 they dragged the mother by her hair into another room and beat her still no confession the o i c was doing the beating they made her sit and hit her across the shins with a wooden pole during the night they got drunk and said theyd rape her there were no women constables
3807153 at midnight i started shouting again because i was so afraid then they brought a lady in
3807154 it was the humiliation because of that i want justice even with all the hardships
3807155 one thing its not that easy to get healed from the shock of torture
3807156 some at least still have anger within themselves they are not healed they are angry and have grudges toward the perpetrators
3807157 we are accustomed in our society to suppressing our feelings we think of how our families look at us how society looks at us so we have to show a different face its a question of cultural values religious values even after a trauma this is not a society in which people can expose their feelings
3807158 my feeling is its not going to be so very peaceful we want to challenge every day many sides of living and always we want to take rights so i am thinking lots of struggle in the future but a good struggle
3807159 in my experience the first thing to say it isnt only a few people suffering due to different incidents in our country the seventy one insurrection the eighty nine and ninety insurrection the eighty three riots due to all of them and what still happens people getting disappeared my family has never been directly affected by any of this but all of my family members have seen dead bodies in the road we think because were not directly affected we do not suffer trauma but the majority of people i can say are suffering some kind of trauma
3807160 there are others with other priests some are in schools elsewhere
3807161 for example i lose my father and mother they were killed or disappeared im faced with going through a normal life but within myself the trauma has never healed so as a result people have become very very insensitive they have someone killed its another incident only all problems are to be solved by some kind of violent means because the system has become so ineffective and corrupt the justice system never delivers justice it delivers injustice people dont expect anything just to happen in society you know well the courts and lawyers arent just you know the judges are corrupt so you try to get things done by other means and naturally you dont respect anyone
3807162 theres a lot of fear they fear everyone who speaks to them they fear all police naturally most of them cant sleep they also become very indifferent and inconsistent i want to change my job then no i dont i want this job
3807163 a contributing factor is the delay in cases you go to court you know very well itll be postponed from 2001 not a single case has been concluded they dont have hope
3807164 i get very frustrated because i cant change certain things i see no hope sometimes i wonder what has happened i see no salvation we have no leadership
3807165 i dont believe in an emerging leader coming up from the bottom
3807166 weve never produced anybody leadership from the bottom i have a limited idea of this but there are leaders not now in power who could change the system if given a chance ive had some contact with them but it all depends even if they came to power its not clear they would have a chance
3807167 i have the opportunity to leave the country sometimes always when i go out i can reflect more when we live in a system we become immune to it we get used to it and we dont try to do anything people think this all that we see around us is normal they think all this happens in other countries so human rights dignity respect sri lankans have to experience these things outside now
3807168 dont complain and we wont press the charge against you
3807169 so far this year for the first nine months weve received two hundred and forty seven complaints of these a hundred and forty one involved the misuse of police power
3807170 ninety percent of people with experience of the police are assaulted this is known i doubt ten percent complain we have nearly a hundred and fifty cases this year and weve hardly begun
3807171 my knees and the side of my left leg are still in pain my parents help me but of course its a strain
3807172 i dont think so even sitting in a chair is difficult im hoping to do some kind of small business i dont really know im still taking treatment
3807173 i dont know who killed him either i complained to the criminal investigations department simply because the police werent doing anything to find out
3807174 outside the house sgt samaranayake punched me in the mouth i asked why are you taking me in and they said to record your statement sgt samaranayake then hit me on the spine with a wooden pole
3807175 on the way to the police station i was taken first to sign various documents at a place where they keep patrol log books
3807176 sgt samaranayake collected the pieces of wood and took them into the next room through the doorway i saw him drinking
3807177 after assaulting my back he started on my stomach and then i lost consciousness when i came to my head was in the stations latrine i shouted for water lasantha brought water i drank it but i vomited immediately
3807178 in the morning a policeman named nimal ranjit came to my cell and i told him i was in pain
3807179 then they brought a stretcher and put me in a jeep to take me to a hospital nearby
3807180 but as i was being admitted i told the lady doctor
3807181 not really i was making a living i hadnt really thought about it
3807182 he told me he could arrange for the police to pay one to one and a half lakhs of rupees i said no
3807183 then chitral came to visit me chitral and a foreign lady they took down details they made a video
3807184 my pastor spoke with chitral after this clifford made the connection with janasansadaya then my pastor spoke with chitral just before we filed the case
3807185 sgt samaranayake and the o i c came back after i filed the case sgt samaranayake didnt come directly his relatives approached me they offered me three lakhs to settle the case i refused then they offered me five lakhs but i refused again now both the o i c and the sergeant have been interdicted
3807186 i dont know why its something ive noticed too there are loads of cases i dont know if the police are especially brutal here
3807187 every day there are new cases i cant really say how many we have sometimes there are three or four a day sometimes one sometimes more
3807188 youre talking about hundreds of cases a year then all to do with human rights
3807189 about a hundred and fifty these are new cases the old ones have to come back ten to fifteen times because there are new details in their cases new arrests people are tortured again after the case begins new charges are fabricated
3807190 me im not a victim but i intervened in the malkanthi case the case ill introduce you to this afternoon and i had threats afterward i once attended the human rights commission in matara regarding another case and the police there began insulting me and the work we do afterward they came to ask us to withdraw the case i got a little scared on that occasion i phoned chitral immediately
3807191 we have links with people people like chitral we can gather two hundred people whenever we want no problem
3807192 weve come to conclude the schools are as bad or worse than the police stations
3807193 on 3rd march 2005 because i teased another student a teacher summoned me and hit me on my ear i suffer epileptic fits
3807194 hes on medication and we had this under control for the past five years but when he was assaulted the fits came back on the same day as the incident he had a fit and urinated in his clothes
3807195 after the teacher hit me the principal called me in and suspended me for a week when he hit me my hearing was damaged later on the principal told me to come with my father
3807196 i sent the two of them the principal forced his father to sign certain documents i had to take action against that later on i didnt know what the papers said so i brought them to this office
3807197 after my son was assaulted i explained to the hikkaduwa police they had called only me not the school authorities i felt they were not taking proper action so i came to see this lady this lady sent me to panadura
3807198 i cant remember the documents but i suspected they were something bad so i visited the regional director of education he chased me from his office i went to see the principal she chased me too she wanted only his father the principal also refused to let the boy back in school as a result he has lost a year and a half of his education
3807199 i urged the regional educational director to insure my son goes back
3807200 later i explained to the educational director and he said my son had been suspended because he wrote a letter to a girl it was then we went to the supreme court with a fundamental rights case
3807201 exactly a year later one of my younger sons a seven year old was assaulted by his teacher and suspended for five months for failing to meditate properly then we went to the supreme court with both cases eventually both boys were found new schools but the court did not see fit to take action against the assaulting
3807202 this woman is fearless and insists on confronting officials shes unafraid of authority thats why the principal asked only for the father he doesnt think too far hell do anything people say
3807203 this happened a lot in the old school it seems do you know why
3807204 i distributed leaflets i sold some booklets i held up banners
3807205 these sorts of problems are they getting better or worse
3807206 every civilized society has a proper medical legal system clifford said
3807207 unless we have such a system a society can go into a vertical situation
3807208 youre losing law and order the smooth functioning of society weve had this nobody knows how your next door neighbor died nobody wants to inquire nobody wants to investigate
3807209 i was in melbourne at the time of the tsunami i called my office they said dont come theres no work for us this was the position of the government just clean up bury the bodies only when foreign pressure came to identify the foreigners did they realize that what they did was wrong now theyve agreed they made a mistake but they dont learn its my belief that if we had another tsunami tomorrow the same thing would happen forensics are not important
3807210 when transferring bodies you use body bags we dont have body bags in the state medical stores so we have to plead with the international organizations we had a notice in the sunday newspapers perhaps you saw it in this heat with these delays we put every body into at least three body bags i need fifty before i go and i dont have a single one its a seven or eight hour journey to colombo and we have no refrigeration trucks weve requested them nothing
3807211 were expected to document our findings the severity of the injuries the weapons used the timing we have a standard form a medico legal form its called these forms are at least twenty five years old they were designed by a j m o who retired sixteen years ago if you have a traffic accident the form is good enough but if you have a torture victim it isnt sometimes there are more than a hundred injuries in these cases the space provided to describe these injuries is two lines sometimes we dont see these cases until a week or a month after the incident this is crucial information for the lawyers but there is no place on the form to specify the timing when something happened
3807212 this is the final version of events that is accepted by the courts that means its not only a form its a big problem
3807213 the form is used to limit allegations of torture sometimes to limit the available medical evidence sometimes so weve adopted a different method we call it free style we go to our computer we write our findings in full sign it and submit it but the courts are the final deciders it could be that it is not enough it is not accepted sometimes
3807214 you alter the injuries recorded in the documentation they dont match what is there in front of you
3807215 these things happen its a problem but not everywhere its mostly in district or base hospitals the lowest on the chain you see influence from lawyers or government attorneys against the litigant theyll do it in a very friendly manner its known only to you
3807216 i find it difficult to make change because i know the problems are connected with other problems and concern the authorities i cant confront this i have no way of influencing
3807217 the best option is to ignore these problems you either function in a low key or you leave these alternatives are there for some professions like doctors for good or bad
3807218 when you go a hundred or a hundred and fifty kilometers from colombo you see rice paddies you see tea and tea pluckers
3807219 were producing enough professionals its true but still there is a lot of underdevelopment in the rural areas in the north and east sometimes there is no doctor for two hundred to five hundred kilometers
3807220 finally i thought i shouldnt be here i had to safeguard myself and my family i looked around there was a vacancy for commissioner general of prisons i applied but i didnt get it they gave it to a judge i had trained a judge with no qualifications for the job
3807221 we dont have to buy a lot from the outside
3807222 i can practice but people dont come to me the c j and others will not hold the scales evenly when my cases appear
3807223 i did some work for a lawyer whom i knew from my years on the bench
3807224 three thousand rupees whats that about thirty dollars isnt it it pays for some of my childrens school van charges they come to five thousand a month
3807225 i simply upheld the independence of the judiciary i cant compromise on this point
3807226 what i believe is my children can walk down the road heads straight
3807227 i sleep very well at night true wealth lies in a clear conscience
3807228 the police took no action then a special order came from the president and a team was sent to investigate allegations that the opposition had begun making after its inquiries the team made an arrest it was a very big event this bombing
3807229 after the arrest it came out that the chief minister of the province had shared a meal with the suspect just prior to the attack that same day
3807230 these are things i know from the investigation but after the disclosure about the chief minister the investigation stopped that was the end
3807231 no we cannot have the order that would result from a full investigation arrests of the culpable trials sentences let us use the system as we have come to use it to maintain the disorder we require to remains in power
3807232 but the president thought an independent judiciary was a huge obstacle
3807233 the help of the police was important to the president and the s l f p there was election rigging there was pressure of various kinds put on political opponents there was a huge misuse of government property and public funds there was no proper auditing politicians used money as they wanted an independent judiciary was an obstacle to getting all this done the choice of the present c j was ultimately about keeping power and the c j wanted judicial officials who would safeguard the ruling party that was his job
3807234 the judiciary prior to the appointment of the present c
3807235 there may have been j o s having problems but none were trumped up wijetunge was the first and that was in 1999 he had been on the bench for twenty six years and was on the brink of retirement he was five days away i think that is where the c j started his operations
3807236 this was at the same time as the bombing everything was happening at once
3807237 so he took his last option which was to get me out of the district through the present c j who had just then been appointed
3807238 when the transfer came i knew what the reason was then i got the extension i took a lenient attitude toward the bombing matter it was a question of survival
3807239 i want to make a certain point with these details
3807240 the c j wanted to remove me for inefficiency this was his groundwork
3807241 the c j s arachchi told me sir this doctor is very well known to the c j he spoke in sinhalese and the term was honda hitawath meaning a very faithful friend but with certain implications a slight suggestion of lover then the arachchi said sir conclude these matters quickly leave the final judgment in his lordships hands you do the needful he will look after the rest as he left he took the files for these cases from the middle of my pile and put them on top
3807242 i was a very independent officer if an arrest is necessary a minister or anyone else without any discussion i wouldve directed it
3807243 i was confused i was deeply shocked i knew that if i didnt fall in line with the c j i would bear the consequences but if there was evidence available to me and i discharged the cases one fine day after the c j retires there would be a commission to deal with people like me and i would be penalized
3807244 it was when the media publicity started that i began to be afraid two jeeps land rover defenders the kind the army and the police use came to the gate my watcher told me then i began to get telephone calls anonymous threats and for the next several years i kept my whereabouts unclear i used the family estate at kotmale toward nuwara eliya i used a bungalow my grandfather had built for hiding during the war for the first year i didnt even sleep in the bungalow at night i slept outside
3807245 also the justice system has reached such a level that it would make me miserable it is unrevivable at this point
3807246 im out of the limelight now but im still careful i hide my vehicle in the churchyard and then go to the courts in the evenings i can fade away
3807247 i wanted to protest but i had no way of going to the supreme court to file a fundamental rights case against the j s c i knew it would be futile j s c members are also supreme court justices the c j is chairman of the j s c so he will nominate the bench to hear his cases and sometimes he will take a case himself
3807248 i gave the church the concept of the school and then got others interested
3807249 i decided to go into the judiciary because i liked the independence of the profession the judiciary was independent and people had faith in it there was no question of interference from the government
3807250 in 1979 i completed twenty one years before i had to leave i was in the hill country kandy matale gampola then i went to matara and then to kuliyapitiya then i came to colombo
3807251 when did i become a d j the exact year i cant remember but it was after the matara station then in colombo i was promoted to d j super grade the highest in the d j system
3807252 when we joined the judiciary we had senior supreme court judges who had excellent experience in the system and in the law they were able to instruct newcomers and place them on a foundation
3807253 i would say sort of it was that is we were guided given a foundation guided to be independent that is the crux of the matter they were very helpful in this way we had a very great respect for them because we found their attitude toward dispensing justice
3807254 it was unquestionable no one leveled any accusation of bias or partisanship during their careers as superior court judges
3807255 i was born in the hill country mawanella my primary education was from a buddhist school a theosophical society school these schools ordinarily established temples so we grew up close to the temple and were taught buddhist philosophy
3807256 later on i joined thurstan college in colombo everything was free i got a degree from the university of colombo in law while i was working then i entered the law college of sri lanka and passed out as an advocate
3807257 and then when you became a judge you eventually found problems
3807258 later on i found there was political interference with judges if a minister or an m p doesnt like a judge in his area who sticks to the law and independence there is interference by transferring before the due period lapses in the station appointees are entitled to three years these mid term transfers were mainly due to politicians interference or someone made a grievance to a minister or to someone in high office
3807259 i believe after mrs bandaranaike came as president in the 1990s
3807260 before that we had no fear of interference it was very prominent after this before this it was subtle they would suggest there were some exigencies and a need here or there but it would have a legal basis
3807261 when i was transferred to colombo i had a number of cases that involved big businessmen and firms and supporters of ministers and m p s often the defendant or the accused had a connection with the political hierarchy so i found it difficult to work because even the police were partial toward the accused in criminal cases and the prosecutions were not carried out properly charges were not looked into properly and the prosecution wanted some way or other to set free the accused they are interested in
3807262 on the other hand you had people accused of crimes who should not have been brought before court they were there unjustly because there was no evidence but due to their political opponents they were brought in
3807263 i had to balance this very delicately to send the innocent free and those really involved in crime to be prosecuted
3807264 interdicted i was framed on trumped up charges and ultimately had my retirement benefit reduced
3807265 i cited four cases to the president one involved two m p s from ratnapura one of them is now a deputy minister they were caught up in a murder case the shooting of a close relation of chandrika they were in hiding the police couldnt arrest them there were tv and radio announcements reward of ten lakhs each
3807266 then both were surrendered to the court where i was presiding
3807267 their lawyers brought them and this was the problem if someone is in your hands you can do whatever you want the government couldve dealt with them extra legally instead they were brought before the law
3807268 this was the last case i heard before i was interdicted
3807269 there was never a trial so i couldnt take up the case it was ishinis case her full name is ishini wickremasinghe perera she is the daughter of the present opposition leaders brother niece of the opposition leader she was news director of tnl a tv channel her father owned tnl reported that an army camp in the north had been surrounded and outnumbered by the l t t e the government denied it and wanted the news director the daughter arrested for inciting communal violence i did nothing i found it was purely political maneuvering to get her remanded
3807270 yes there were cases of torture in the past but mainly because people were not aware of their rights so they thought torture was something accepted by law now people are more aware so more cases are being reported but before unless someone was badly injured people thought it a way of life a minor injury they thought o k its nothing serious to be reported people thought it was somehow legal to be tortured
3807271 there was a king named kekille who was very stupid he rendered stupid judgments and in one he ended up punishing an innocent man
3807272 there was a mason building a wall a parapet wall the wall collapsed and injured a passer by the injured man complained to the king who then formed a court and sat in judgment
3807273 so the king said bring the pretty woman and the woman said dont blame me i had to pass the wall on the way to buy some jewelry
3807274 its not my fault the jeweler argued before the court i have to earn a living
3807275 the jeweler was very thin and when the king proposed to kill him by letting an elephant trample him he said o k i dont mind but remember im only skin and bones and the elephant might hurt himself
3807276 who shall i punish then the king asked the jeweler said a fat man a chef
3807277 the king found such a man and killed him and the roly poly man who was punished had no idea even what had happened to the wall
3807278 in a lot of villages ive visited people used to say when judgments come our justice is like king kekilles justice there are many tales to this effect buddhist stories folk stories legends like that of the king
3807279 people start from the assumption that ordinary sri lankans dont know their rights i wouldnt accept this notion you find always that people have a strong sense of their rights and of justice maybe they dont know where it comes from what law the constitution the u n but the awareness of basic rights is there
3807280 a man got up slightly drunk and said whats the point
3807281 the life up there was the best experience i lived in a rented house with other government officials slept on a crude folding bed a
3807282 it was then i began to hear stories like the one i told you and its these i remember most not what i read in books i learned to master things and i learned that the hierarchy can be challenged and in fact must be challenged i learned that people have challenged it in all sorts of ways throughout history
3807283 so i tried various things i tried to start an underground movement that failed people werent really committed i raised ornamental fish i managed several hotels i became a
3807284 but you find not only the truth its the truth but not only the truth that shouldve been our slogan
3807285 at the time there was an n g o called m d d r movement for the defense of democratic rights i was put in charge of training it was then i began going to villages to teach people about legal rights and a variety of other basic things land disputes family disputes how to make a complaint i had a training program called law to the village and that was my entry into human rights
3807286 everything had deteriorated discipline standards of teaching what struck me most was the lack of respect teachers and students teachers and principals students and principals all of these relationships had changed principals and teachers started accusing one another this one has personal connections this one shouldnt be here and so on students parents teachers all knew about these arguments and i think it was the reason for the lack of respect some teachers didnt have even basic qualifications some couldnt teach or control even a fifth grade class most education officers and principals were appointed totally according to political connections
3807287 and i learned to teach by way of personal example
3807288 people used to be accustomed to addressing others seniors and juniors as mister then it changed to sir for those senior they demanded it in sinhala it had been mahatthaya the equivalent of mister and then for those senior it became sir just as in english now if you use mahatthaya they get angry
3807289 sir it is a device for maintaining the idea of hierarchy earlier no one needed to demand respect because they were certain they had earned it once the system of political appointments came in people at the top knew they didnt deserve to be there
3807290 the second point after empowerment is we must give people solutions you need to provide practical answers the third point at least for human rights activists well teach them parts of the law we raise awareness connecting common notions of justice the stories and legends and so forth with modern concepts this is not for everyone the majority are told what you say is right well join you in your fight for rights its not necessary to educate everybody in all the complexities of the law
3807291 the other day you used the word revolution to describe what you are working toward what did you mean
3807292 what changed first was the idea of third party intervention the belief that someone else had to be there
3807293 for example if an ordinary person walks into a police station he will be insulted rubbished or ignored
3807294 post independence the government took advantage of this and prolonged it and now it is intensified now its forcing the issue of powerlessness awareness is forcing the issue
3807295 heres the judicial system judges up here at the top ordinary people down here the police the lawyers the doctors the department all in the middle our revolution is telling people they dont need anyone in the middle to intervene for them access to justice is an inherent right the revolution is to break the mentality you see in the pyramid
3807296 another example again a letter arrives from the police attend this inquiry it says but it comes after the date of the inquiry we say write provide dates and times explain inform this year weve had seventy five people in these kinds of situations counting families a hundred and fifty altogether if we can start with this small group and change attitudes they are empowered and they can go back to their villages and tell others and they do we always ask when someone comes how do you know of us weve now got cases from two hundred kilometers away
3807297 what is it that needs to change most in sri lanka
3807298 they should inscribe on every wall in the country the bismarckian proposition that politics is the art of the possible not the yearning for the impossible
3807299 the strategy seemed to be spray and pray lets go speed speed speed
3807300 charge em charge em charge em and lets pray that we can pull this off
3807301 they leave because there is nothing there except their everything
3807302 how many cases in 2001 i think i missed those figures
3807303 fundamental rights jurisdiction article 11 cases in 2001 ninety nine reported of these twenty nine decisions with compensation sixty seven cases dismissed two pending as of now
3807304 there are violations of human rights which we cannot deny
3807305 but everything possible is being done to minimize these violations
3807306 you cannot say there is no hope the human resources are superb you can turn around the mentality in a couple of years if you really concentrate on it
3807307 the black white man or loosely translated the brown skinned britisher is to some extent the foundation on which our hierarchical system is built
3807308 fabrication of charges illegal arrest and detention torture harassment intimidation extra judicial killings we have cases supporting all of these most of the people we deal with are from marginalized sections of society they are poor they are from remote areas
3807309 even from the time i was a child it was known if you go to the police station youre going to get tortured it was known but no one would do anything about it
3807310 in the 1980s police torture was a fact of life by then
3807311 my boss whose investigative skills were appreciated even by scotland yard his belief was that if you lay even a finger on a suspect youre no investigator this was standard then
3807312 with the escalation of conflict in the country eighty two eighty three
3807313 what did this look like as you watched it can you recall
3807314 the standard at c i d was not observed by everybody there had been proper monitoring of junior officers by senior this is another serious cause the responsibility of senior officers in monitoring became another serious problem again commencing in the 1980s
3807315 the real situation in this country is off the record
3807316 the real situation is that people are not worried about what happens to others until it comes to their backyard theyre not interested this wasnt there in the past twenty thirty years back but now violence is so rampant people dont want to get involved
3807317 you hear nothing at all of the violence the war the disappearances
3807318 it has been twenty three years now take me i basically grew up with it
3807319 i see no basic difference in the concerns of my patients there and here
3807320 i say desensitized its different insensitivity implies callousness to be desensitized implies a sense of acceptance it happened so what this is the thought i hear nothing that could be related to the conflict marriage work debts this is what i hear about just as in england it is what i mean by desensitized the possibility of being killed by a bomb is there in the city every day we go to work but its only recently we are able to sit and talk about it at all
3807321 the laws of the country are too weak we are breaking the law to strengthen it
3807322 he was forced to lie on a bench and beaten with a pole held under water for prolonged periods beaten on the soles of his feet with blunt instruments and books were placed on his head which were then hit with blunt instruments
3807323 the delay in the disposal of the supreme court case and the criminal case amounted to an unreasonably prolonged delay
3807324 the attitude of society and the judiciary is that if youre detained for committing a crime you deserve to be tortured it is an unwritten rule
3807325 rations provided by an international organization the u n i think dahl rice oil salmon tinney we also got some money to build latrines and wells but no forest
3807326 now the seventy nine are a hundred and nine others have also come altogether we have four hundred to six hundred families here now and the same amount of land it is not enough
3807327 well be happy to live as we did for many generations before we came here lokubanda said
3807328 we do not want to be part of the public space called sri lanka
3807329 when we were in the forest we knew how to use it when the mahaweli diversion project started in the early 1980s thats when the destruction of things started the younger generation is different look at the way theyre dressed they wear caps and t shirts they dont even know the language when we try to teach it theyre not interested its not taught in school so the children get used to sinhala
3807330 you can learn whatever you want in school but why not cling to your own language
3807331 were supposed to keep our community intact its not only the dress but also the language
3807332 they may go to school but they dont have jobs
3807333 i imagine youve never lived any other way and wont will you
3807334 how could i feel the wind or smell the rain when its coming how could i hear the animals how could i listen to the trees at night how could i see the stars
3807335 if i am sinhalese my identity card will be written in sinhala that is all if i am tamil it will be in sinhala and tamil as soon as a policeman asks for your identity card he is informed it tells him what you are
3807336 you have been in sri lanka for a long time now
3807337 its about about how sri lankans live its about some institutions the judiciary for instance its about how people think you could say there is some history there is some psychology
3807338 in the course of things but tell me about the muslims faahik
3807339 its about the muslim community there is a climate of fear among the muslims you cannot see it you will have to look to find it but it is there i am a muslim i can tell you we are very frightened we look at what they have done and we ask are we next it is not a far fetched question
3807340 we have a call to prayers very early in the morning you have heard this before
3807341 it is not intended as a disturbance it is not intended as a provocation its very brief just a call to prayers and thats it
3807342 the buddhists decided they didnt like this practice do you know what they did they began waiting until after the call to prayers and then they put hymns and chanting on the loudspeakers all over the neighborhood for an hour and a half every morning an hour and a half do you know what we found out
3807343 we found out that there was no one chanting a monk was setting his alarm getting up putting a cassette in his recorder turning it on and then going back to sleep
3807344 how did you find out about the monk and the cassette
3807345 in the villages they are calm communal feelings are less
3807346 there are two expressions i will explain to you in the villages they say
3807347 it wasnt just the case itself it was something larger why should anyone hope were all upset in this respect we tell people to hope they fight for years why should they now the harassment will get worse
3807348 my home is payagala south of here and i come by bus
3807349 the payagala police arrested him tortured him and killed him in the course of taking legal measures regarding this incident i met with janasansadaya he was arrested in 2000 he was twenty three
3807350 he was a soldier in the army but because of the war he was not given leave and so he came for a holiday and he didnt go back
3807351 he had permission for a short holiday but stayed on
3807352 do you mean he deserted is this what we are talking about
3807353 they continuously kept him in jaffna and there was no one to look after his wife and baby
3807354 i think both influenced him he wasnt happy about the war and then the family situation
3807355 did he have a view on the ethnic problem as it is called
3807356 he stayed about six months then the police asserted he was an army deserter then the arrest and assault he was five days in the police station initially we were told they would take him back to the army but later he got word to my mother he was being assaulted and that she should tell the army
3807357 are you able to tell me how he was tortured
3807358 a person in custody with him gave evidence saying they placed heavy books on his head and then hit the books with clubs
3807359 it causes serious internal injuries but leaves no external marks its not the first time
3807360 they put him on a bench and hit him on the soles of his feet
3807361 internal injuries internal injuries leading to haemmorhages haemmorhages infecting the kidneys
3807362 it was during the tsunami he played a victim and disappeared
3807363 the boys mother left my parents are getting on there wasnt anyone else
3807364 i wanted justice for my bother and to insure this never happens to anyone else
3807365 its important the rights of people in this country are safeguarded
3807366 i am half tamil in the family we never discussed it it didnt matter to anyone and i speak no tamil
3807367 it made us conscious that there was a difference between us and for me it was also confusing was i tamil or sinhala
3807368 so there is no visible difference no one can tell this i know for a fact what is the difference then it is history it is what is carried in the mind
3807369 it is all rather heavily sinhalese mr hewage dont you think
3807370 but we have a good collection on hindu we have very beautiful and unique siva images they are in gallery four with parvati sivas wife and some other figures in gallery one you can see surya figures kali one of the hindu goddesses and there are many hindu stone objects in gallery seven
3807371 are there any exhibitions having to do with modern history mr hewage
3807372 it is failing and could fail but it isnt failed the state still provides services to people when all is said and done there is law and order
3807373 we have to accept the fact that we live in a failed state it is us it is ours an ugly country
3807374 failed its not a theory its not just an ethnic war its the whole thing public transport schools all of it the media are a problem the intellectuals are a problem they will never come out and articulate their views independently the judiciary the bureaucracy civil society show me one thing working in a really nice way
3807375 if you want a big change you begin with education
3807376 if the society can understand they will remove the top strata and start to build a new state so people can live peacefully and with dignity
3807377 ask the legislators ask the judges the media the bureaucrats youll see they dont know what their role is they dont even know what it is they are supposed to do
3807378 two years ago i attended a conference on investigative journalism in copenhagen five hundred people all the big guys
3807379 then a professor asked me a question he was from the university of chicago he said your story is unbelievable but what is the reaction in society
3807380 i said i dont know how to explain this to you
3807381 they need treatment you have to treat the whole society it isnt normal it cant be one by one you have to take the whole and treat it
3807382 one by one or all at once youre still talking about changing minds it comes to the same thing
3807383 i wanted to check the fat content of some food items it turns out that the standard tables i found are in a format that makes calculating the most relevant number of calories from fat about as difficult to calculate as possible that is the fat content is listed as grams per ounce you have to look up the number of grams in an ounce just to get started
3807384 one should never put on ones best trousers to go out to battle for freedom and truth
3807385 well that certainly explains far too much about your childhood
3807386 and i havent even told you about the cashew chicken and the garden hose
3807387 is that why you dont drink milk you know i need milk for my coffee
3807388 well just this once can you buy milk i bought the toilet paper
3807389 the free range cows are grass fed making the milk amazingly complex and flavorful

3807392 this is the time of the olympics and were taking about air quality in china
3807393 its all well and good to criticize other countries but lets get our own house in order
3807394 approximately 70 per cent of acute premature deaths will come from these two provinces possibly reflecting their poorer air quality relative to other parts of canada
3807395 i think the public is probably unaware that many of the chemicals they use around their homes or the pharmaceuticals they take themselves ultimately end up in the natural environment and are very difficult to handle
3807396 we really dont know what the long term effects of these things are in the environment some are persistent and dont break down
3807397 were finding very very little going on having very little impact
3807398 the immune system will start dysfunctioning and eventually depression or anxiety can be the result
3807399 when that happens people are not as happy as we need them to be
3807400 we usually get up about six oclock in the morning
3807401 it started raining at about a quarter to six and when youre in a tent its even worse it does affect your mood
3807402 when you start analyzing it its not just the weather but the weather certainly played a part
3807403 people expect this time of year to have nice sunny weather
3807404 they can go on vacation they can relax and when that expectation isnt met the body is going to have a stress reaction
3807405 its a complex system that will take some time to change
3807406 but im very optimistic that in a three to five year timeline things will absolutely be better
3807407 madonnas representatives have been visiting the girl the adoption is now
3807408 then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3807409 the adoption process in malawi is so long and stressful
3807410 they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
3807411 we know that it is mercy who madonna really wants we heard it is
3807412 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go
3807413 but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then

3807421 sebelumnya permukaan sirkuit ini begitu kasar tapi aspal yang baru begitu halus dan licin dan sulit untuk dapat cengkraman yang baik tapi yang baik dari aspal baru adalah mengurangi permukaan yang bergelombang
3807422 kami harus menyesuaikan kompon ban kami untuk aspal baru ini dimana kami harap akan memberikan tim dan pembalap kami awal yang baik pada jumat pagi
3807423 permukaannya sudah begitu lama di dua tahun terakhir tidak hanya bergelombang tapi juga kasar dan retak
3807424 saya pikir aspal yang baru akan lebih baik saya dengar mereka bukan hanya meletakkan sesuatu diatasnya mereka mengerjakannya dengan baik dan memulainya kembali
3807425 kami telah mencoba aspalnya dan pengujian tersebut mengatakan pada kami bahwa sirkuit tersebut begitu agresif dengan ban depan tapi tidak dengan ban belakang yang mana mengartikan campuran kerikilnya tidak kasar tapi kombinasi dari bentuk sirkuit dan aspal baru membuat kerja ban depan lebih berat
3807426 i definitely see what you mean about contrasting blonde white beautiful celebrities with obama a handsome black man absolutely despicable those kinds of fears are prevalent for both blacks and whites i hate to admit it but it is very clever of the republicans they have found that they do not even have to run on their own issues but play on peoples anxieties and fears psychologically no matter how irrational those fears are
3807427 mccain and his crazy advisers are also desperate to ramp up the current conflict between russia and georgia into a new cold war thats why the administration armed and encouraged the georgians in the first place
3807428 and then obama was like ill make you admit global warming
3807429 and i would point out that racism is intrinsically evil and can never be supported flirted with or exploited
3807430 in 2001 princeton political scientist tali mendelberg summarized this research in a pathbreaking book the race card their findings suggest that racism remains deeply embedded within the psyche of the american electorate so deep that many voters may not even be aware of their own feelings on the subject
3807431 in elections over the last three decades republican politicians have repeatedly used ads push polls and surrogates to appeal to white voters racial fears and resentments
3807432 in the race card mendelberg argues that political ads can indeed awaken underlying racial stereotypes and attitudes just like a black face flashing subliminally on a screen mendelbergs most controversial claim is that these ads work best when the appeal is implicit if the appeal is explicit she argues that is if politicians actually say that blacks are undeserving then they lose support because they have violated the norm against racism although voters will respond unconsciously to an implicit appeal that they dont perceive as racist they will recoil for reasons of conscience or social disapproval to an appeal that either is or is seen as racist
3807433 first one has to distinguish between kinds of explicit messages
3807434 the people viewing the ads are going to be disproportionately young and well educated
3807435 this is seemingly driven by a deep psychological trauma on the part of the once dashing political maverick adored by the media a household name who appeared in manifold movies and other outlets of popular culture the king of celebrity politicians has been dethroned and he is not at all happy about it as he lashes out these ads have become a sign of how bankrupt his campaign has become
3807436 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good

3807453 this may sound kind of harsh but if the democratic nominee were a white male from a red or purple state the theory would be dead on that this would be set up there would be a very very high probability for a democratic landslide

3807464 the minimum safe level of ame capability required at tarin kowt is two dedicated helicopters anything less is unnecessarily exposing our soldiers to the same or greater delay which did sig mccarthy no favours

3807475 unfortunately now hes decided to go to the republic of ireland and play for bohemians so he was a target of mine
3807476 for me to replace martyn woolford that would probably cost me more than we got in because i think martyn was a tremendous player
3807477 he was my player of the year last year he always in my eyes had the potential to go on and on and from a personal point of few im glad he has

3807482 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3807483 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3807484 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3807485 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms

3807502 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3807503 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3807504 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3807505 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3807506 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3807507 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3807508 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3807509 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3807510 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3807511 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3807512 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3807513 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3807514 this gets at the stability of the framework the us thought was going to govern the post cold war world

3807516 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3807517 the united states its allies and other countries need to send a strong signal to moscow that creating 19th century style spheres of influence and redrawing the borders of the former soviet union is a danger to world peace
3807518 i think this is a very unequivocal support were getting from you
3807519 the main thing is if the west fails now then it will have tremendous consequences for the world for years to come
3807520 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3807521 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3807522 to my mind its yet another piece of strong evidence in support of the hobbit having an ancient lineage not something closely related to modern humans let alone a diseased individual of our species importantly this new study continues to undermine claims that the hobbit suffered from a medical condition known as microcephaly that is a modern human with an abnormally small brain by looking at a part of the anatomy far removed from the head namely the wrist bones microcephalics do not have unusually shaped wrist bones but the hobbit does and the features of the wrist bones are echoed in the primitive traits seen in many other parts of the skeleton including the skull which has been almost the sole focus of attention of the pro microcephaly camp

3807570 comparing african history to that of europe one can clearly see the need to initiate the continents own age of enlightenment obviously no single individual drove the european enlightenment but historians do point out the fact that the quest to have reason as a primary source and basis for authority created a new order in europe according to prof gregory clark the majority of the english as late as 1813 were in conditions no better than their ancestors in africa europeans in london were a filthy people who squatted above their own feces stored in the basement cesspits
3807571 european history is dotted with tribalism ethnicity superstition extreme religious beliefs repressive kingdoms and wars but that ought not to be an excuse for africans to celebrate the lesson europe offers however is that the exploitation of an inquiring mind a mind that was willing to be rebellious and give reason the power to shape peoples lives is what gave birth to europe as we know it today africans ought to drive their own age of enlightenment by asking such basic questions as to why a continent rich in minerals is perceived to be poorer than the rest of the world why must a rich continent be aid dependent why is it that ethnicity in africa is perceived to be the core to conflicts on the continent what prevents african leaders from developing a long term vision for their own people how can we fuse cultural beliefs and legal systems with the larger global systems in order to surface africas predominantly underground economy should africans simply agree with prof clarks assertions that no real development is taking place in africa simply because population growth outstrips economic growth and that the quality of labor output in africa is below standard
3807572 zimbabwes shadow justice minister david coltart and ugandan journalist and documentary maker mr andrew mwenda who were also present at a recent lecture about africa emerged as optimists on the future of africa the general thread of our argument was that africa is in transition whatever the developed countries view as negative is actually positive the western investors were reminded to shun a narrow minded approach to africa andrew gave an example where a leading cell phone company mtn could not secure credit from western financiers simply because they believed that africa is a continent where nothing good can be achieved ten years later mtn now a leading cell phone company in uganda has western financing institutions literally begging it to take their funds for david zimbabwe has a bright future investors should not treat zimbabwe as if it were some static entity what the international community ought to do is to focus on long term to the western world the riots that rocked kenya after the bungled presidential elections was a sign of retrogression but analyzed critically it was a positive sign that africans can no longer let their freedoms to be trampled upon by dictators in other words when africans protest against repressive regimes the western media perceives the same to be a sign of retrogression for kenya the post election violence pointed out the fact that people in the east african region are interdependent
3807573 africans on the continent probably do not quite know whether to start cerebrating now or wait till the smoke settles in zimbabwe the prospect of movement for democratic change mdc partaking of the political cake is now as real as robert mugabes permanent banishment from the throne yet average zimbabweans like myself will keep one eye wide open not so much that i seem to thrive on adrenalin generated by controversy but am weary of so called african unity agreements especially where they resemble anything like kenya already order books for more gravy bowls seem full what with south african president thabo mbeki pushing for according to zimonline reports power sharing proposals where tsvangirai becomes executive prime minister while mugabe remains president with at least two or three vice presidents and two deputy prime ministers drawn from the three negotiating parties this structure was designed to accommodate mugabes present vice presidents joseph msika and joyce mujuru in addition to other top officials of the negotiating parties such as mdc second in command thokozani khupe and emmerson mnangagwa a hawkish mugabes loyalist who would become deputy prime ministers now you tell me by the time we are done with aides deputies secretaries pas receptionists drivers and messengers zimbabwe will have the biggest compromise government in the history of political settlements mind you the other six relatively unknown fringe political parties are already screaming their lungs out for being left out of the show
3807574 my personal dislike of governments is not alien to liberal extremism it is justified because governments especially african ones specialise in legitimised plunder my country has been under zanupf for almost thirty years the last ten of which have seen very little of no industrial production a vital component of tax revenue even with the best of intentions a highly skilled workforce and superb balance of payments support we can only hope to reach our economic sanity targets end of 2009 in the intervening period the prospect of a donor driven public budget is real considering that mdc made exciting committments to reverse collapsed infrastructure both robert mugabe and his chief banker gideon gono have driven our economy to complete bankruptcy by my estimates although zimbabwes vast mineral and tourist resources are the shot term weapons we have against an inevitable deludge of undesirable international indebtedness i cannot tsvangirayi resisting the temptation to fund a huge budget deficit with external funds

3807599 i think a change of government would probably not be much different from the present government
3807600 but people perceive they national might be and they might be better for business
3807601 it will turn around it always turns around the market is never down forever they are more up than down so you probably have just got to ride it out we have these economic cycles ups and downs and the world never ends
3807602 ive waited 20 years to get a car like that and it makes me so angry that someone has come into my garage and taken it

3807605 a friend said theyd called in on monday night and it wasnt there then

3807766 it was koreas internet and mobile telecommunications infrastructure that empowered the

3807774 this is simply the newspaper making a marketing decision who are we being unfair to we support any number of events through sponsorships that we feel benefit the community
3807775 journalism is in the midst of an epochal transformation as momentous probably as the invention of the telegraph or television
3807776 journalism however is not becoming irrelevant it is becoming more complex we are witnessing conflicting trends of fragmentation and convergence simultaneously and they sometimes lead in opposite directions
3807777 a growing number of news outlets are chasing relatively static or even shrinking audiences for news one result of this is that most sectors of the news media are losing audience that audience decline in turn is putting pressures on revenues and profits which leads to a cascade of other implications the only sectors seeing general audience growth today are online ethnic and alternative media
3807778 much of the new investment in journalism today much of the information revolution generally is in disseminating the news not in collecting it
3807779 thats quite the understatement give a newsroom fewer resources in terms of time money and news hole and all other things being equal a decline in quality is all but inevitable and in this case all other things are not equal
3807780 in many parts of the news media we are increasingly getting the raw elements of news as the end product
3807781 journalistic standards now vary even inside a single news organization
3807782 without investing in building new audiences the long term outlook for many traditional news outlets seems problematic
3807783 as the quality of journalism continues to decline audiences can be expected to continue to decline as well
3807784 convergence seems more inevitable and potentially less threatening to journalists than it may have seemed a few years ago
3807785 getting the raw elements of news as the end product
3807786 those who would manipulate the press and public appear to be gaining leverage over the journalists who cover them
3807787 i think people had questions at first because of the primaries which showed that hispanics favored hillary clinton by 2 to 1 but a bad economy and party id have already converted hispanics to obama
3807788 there are plenty of evangelicals that admire senator obama because hes talked about his religion so comfortably and they understand he has innovative positions on a number of issues
3807789 obamas level of support is about what democratic candidates usually get in that religious community

3807793 he is still amazed that apparently no one else was looking into the allegations and no major newspaper picked up on his reporting after it appeared
3807794 thats something youd have to ask editors at major newspapers
3807795 but there does seem to be a very strong prejudice toward investing u s official statements with credibility while disregarding statements from almost any other source and in this current situation iraqi sources
3807796 this is a critical moment for journalism in america revolutionary changes in technology in our economic structure and in our relationship with the public are pulling journalism from its traditional moorings

3807805 this election is not about democrats or republicans its about electing the best man to lead us forward the next four years as the president of the united states and the best man for that position is senator john mccain
3807806 and i know from personal experience that the linden voters are intelligent and sophisticated because in 2006 i ran for the mayor of this great city as an independent against a 30 year democratic incumbent and the voters chose the man not the party
3807807 youre going to see a lot more leaders like the members of the council and mayor who are coming out and saying in the end the presidency of the united states is beyond republicans democrats or independents
3807808 its about who is going to be the best leader for our country

3807812 when avoidable financial hardships force hospitals to shut their doors new jerseyans in need are forced to travel longer distances to receive immediate medical care
3807813 we cannot allow fiscal issues to cause another hospital to close its doors and further jeopardize the quality and availability of health care in new jersey
3807814 hospital trustees must be trained in their role and responsibilities to ensure that a hospital is operating efficiently and managing its finances responsibly
3807815 appropriate education and training are key to ensuring that hospital boards are staffed with the most capable and knowledgeable individuals to prevent mismanagement of precious hospital resources
3807816 it is imperative that new jersey communities are part of the decision making process regarding the delivery of health care services to ensure that hospitals are providing quality care to the communities that rely on its services the most
3807817 audits and monitoring by state officials will bring accountability and transparency to new jerseys healthcare industry

3807836 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3807837 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3807838 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3807839 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3807840 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3807841 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing

3807843 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3807844 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3807845 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3807846 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3807847 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3807848 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3807849 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3807850 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3807851 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3807852 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3807853 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3807854 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
3807855 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3807856 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3807857 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3807858 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3807859 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3807860 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3807861 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3807862 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3807863 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3807864 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3807865 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3807866 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3807867 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3807868 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3807869 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3807870 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3807871 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
3807872 on september 6th i am staging a large performance art piece that requires 6 8 hundred people recreating the parade scene from ferris bueller at the deitch art parade in soho
3807873 they injected an anesthetic but didnt wait long enough for it to take effect
3807874 the next week their boss came to me and said your family still doesnt want to pay ransom so we have to send them another one
3807875 i cant describe the anguish i felt imagining pedros suffering
3807876 violence will keep increasing to the extent that mexican law enforcement doesnt take away the attraction of committing a crime
3807877 the media and society as a whole has finally recognized that there is a problem
3807878 we cant tolerate any more of this level of impunity and criminal activities
3807879 its criminals who should be afraid its the bad politicians who should be afraid its the judges who set these murderers free the ones who should be afraid its the corrupt police officers who should be afraid not us
3807880 we want a specific political accord between the president and all 32 governors of mexico to commit to reducing the rates of kidnapping in mexico
3807881 the state is not dismantling organized crime groups through the confiscation of assets freezing of assets of the financial intelligence unit and is not cooperating with police and prosecutors effectively
3807882 because nothing much has been done every day there are more and more kidnappings and everybody is affected
3807883 as soon as they saw it they went right in according to a monroe district police lieutenant
3807884 they started banging on the doors and getting people out according to the lieutenant who said two officers one male one female suffered smoke inhalation but were treated on the scene
3807885 the office of fire investigation has determined the cause of the fire at 1508 1510 1504 w 18th st as incendiary
3807886 and at this time the police bomb and arson section is conducting a further investigation
3807887 we turn our evidence over to the police department so they can determine if it was arson or not
3807888 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds today in the 1970s maybe it was
3807889 existen grandes retos en materia de capacitaci n infraestructura y otros asuntos m s despu s de todo hace tres d cadas que afganist n sufre conflictos
3807890 la reforma del sistema judicial avanza muy lento el ministerio de relaciones exteriores de noruega envi jueces abogados y funcionarios especializados en c rceles para capacitar al personal afgano pero pocos pa ses m s hicieron contribuciones
3807891 otro desaf o tiene que ver con la jurisprudencia internacional y la constituci n afgana que no son del todo compatibles y la existencia de tradiciones locales consejos de ancianos y la sharia
3807892 para los esfuerzos de afganist n y de la comunidad internacional es fundamental la reforma del sistema judicial a fin de construir un estado sustentable basado sobre el derecho y un sistema democr tico de gobernanza pero los avances se ven truncados por la falta de seguridad
3807893 por supuesto que un aumento de la violencia afectar los planes de reforma
3807894 el a o pasado fueron asesinados casi 1 000 polic as en ataques perpetrados por la delincuencia com n y por fuerzas del talib n en caso de concentrarse en convoyes humanitarios la situaci n general se ver enormemente afectada
3807895 hubo algunos avances en la reforma de la polic a tras la intervenci n de estados unidos con cursos de capacitaci n antes de navidad que fue casi una copia exacta de lo que hizo con el ej rcito afgano
3807896 la que est demorada es la reforma judicial y por ello debe entenderse sistema penal tribunales servicios carcelarios y dem s
3807897 no se puede s lo responsabilizar a los afganos por la falta de avances en las reformas pues se les entreg un sistema dise ado de antemano para aplicar tal cual
3807898 se necesita crear capacidad institucional traspasar la responsabilidad a los propios afganos despu s de todo no somos nosotros los que vamos a gobernar el pa s
3807899 si se inyecta demasiado dinero a una zona que sufri una guerra sin tener una burocracia capaz de gestionarlo s lo se fomentar la corrupci n y el despilfarro
3807900 un requisito impuesto por este pa s y por la comunidad internacional para la reforma judicial de afganist n es que las autoridades de esa naci n combatan las irregularidades existentes en los mbitos central y provincial
3807901 no puedo decir exactamente lo que ocurrir entre el ministro de justicia y el banco mundial pero presiento que todo est bastante controlado por la comunidad internacional
3807902 se vuelca mucho dinero a afganist n pero el gobierno s lo puede controlar un peque o porcentaje
3807903 la creaci n de un fondo colectivo para reformar el sistema judicial es un gran paso para acelerar el proceso
3807904 se espera que el mecanismo para gestionar los fondos sirva para ejecutar de forma efectiva las actividades del programa de reforma y la cooperaci n entre donantes y autoridades afganas as como entre donantes
3807905 es una iniciativa perfectamente realizable a poco que la voluntad pol tica de los jefes de estado africanos permanezca y se destinen a ella recursos sustanciosos
3807906 las consecuencias de la desertificaci n ya est n aqu y las soluciones aportadas hasta ahora por los estados y la comunidad internacional son muy limitadas frente a la amplitud del desastre
3807907 una oportunidad para que los pa ses africanos trabajen juntos
3807908 un proyecto interesante pero demasiado pol tico y con poca base cient fica
3807909 al ritmo que se han propuesto tardar n decenas de a os en acabar la muralla
3807910 comenzaron a dispararnos tiraron bombas y empezamos a retroceder fui herido en la pierna en la espalda y tambi n en la cabeza
3807911 tengo miedo pero voy a enfrentarlos si ellos quieren matarme que me quiten la vida pero dejando la tierra para mis hijos
3807912 estar n en riesgo no s lo raposa serra do sol sino todas las reservas ind genas del pa s
3807913 ya fueron presas algunas de esas personas pero por periodos muy cortos ya que disponen de recursos y mucha influencia pol tica que consigue convertir los procesos en disputas jur dicas interminables
3807914 una guerra declarada contra los pueblos ind genas por parte de los sectores que tienen intereses econ micos en sus tierras
3807915 llegaron los no indios e invadieron nuestras tierras empezaron a contratarnos en sus fazendas fincas cuando un indio reclamaba su salario le daban una paliza y lo echaban
3807916 la amazonia es de brasil pero el problema es del mundo entero el problema es de quien defiende la vida
3807917 la presi n sobre los ind genas es m ltiple
3807918 no s lo por parte del agronegocio sino tambi n por obras p blicas como carreteras hidroel ctricas diques
3807919 vamos a tener una modificaci n importante del paisaje de los recursos h dricos de la fauna y la flora debido a las plantaciones de arroz los agrot xicos utilizados por los latifundistas est n contaminando los r os y la fauna acu tica
3807920 todo el veneno todos los residuos de la pulverizaci n del arroz son vertidos en los r os
3807921 las tierras ind genas no sobrevivir n si no hay un reordenamiento ecol gico y econ mico del pa s y de la amazonia
3807922 brasil es el nico pa s con nombre de un rbol extinguido
3807923 como pueblos ind genas vamos a defender la naturaleza porque tenemos esa concepci n de la vida esa cosmogon a del mundo para el futuro de la humanidad
3807924 yes you made a blueberry pie and you remember the last time we had blueberry pie

3807931 theres no time to rationalize no time to weigh the pros and cons of your response

3807939 yes i loved it i thought it was so touching especially at the end but i was really impressed when lydia told me how she thought the ending could have been different id love to hear her talk more about that
3807940 he doesnt get it the mere fact that you would have someone compare the circumstances now in the past or in the future of iraq to the ending of world war ii and the ending of the korean war absolutely demonstrates a total fundamental lack of understanding of what the problems america faces
3807941 i see my path but i dont know where it leads not knowing where im going is what inspires me to travel it
3807942 como se tudo o mais me permitisses a mim me fotografo na ecko manufacturing n s fazemos as coisas de uma forma diferente n s fazemos jeans com amor e olha s nossas funcion rias isso produ o em um novo n vel n s apenas contraramos as mulheres mais sexies do planeta porque como todo mundo sabe garotas gostosas fazem timas roupas
3807943 pagu tem os olhos moles uns olhos de fazer doer bate coco quando passa cora o pega a bater eh pagu eh d i porque bom de fazer doer
3807944 its going to be in the same vein of mtvs the hills but ours is going to be more realistic
3807945 ill be honest when they first approached me i had no desire to do reality tv
3807946 my biggest concern is protecting my relationships and not putting them in jeopardy through the potential negative fuss of reality tv
3807947 maybe people will think im so obvious that it will make them think twice about their mole choice
3807948 dear lord do not let me hurt this man for real
3807949 ive done too much in my life to let one person keep me from the possibility of 500 000

3807988 id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood

3807992 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
3807993 what did the adviser say they could do and what did the customer hear
3807994 did the planner say they could beat the indexes on a regular basis has he told them he has some magic way of avoiding volatility
3807995 consumers who were promised too much are certainly getting too little for their money in this market
3807996 the ones where expectations were realistic probably are getting what they paid for and will look back at some point and recognize that this is the period when their adviser really made them money
3807997 the key in this market is to manage expectations and i dont know how many advisers are doing that well
3807998 the problem is that the customer turns to the adviser because they want help and while better performance is implied in that what they really want is the ability to sleep at night the planner does the work but the expectation is that there will be some jump in performance or at least not a decline and thats hard in this market
3807999 is to lose 60 of whatever the market is going down if the market loses 10 and we lose 6 then were doing a great job as long as our clients are prepared for it
3808000 there are quite a few advisers out there who are giving bad advice but it usually looks like good advice at the time thats particularly true right now no matter which direction people are going
3808001 most financial planners stay the course once they get the client and figure out the clients needs
3808002 stay the course is great for money managers who dont care about people reaching their goals if you are going to do planning you have to be willing to change the allocation we could go four or five years with this kind of market and stay the course is like telling someone to keep taking medicine that you know is killing them the best advice keeps emotions in check stays focused on the long term but it keeps evolving
3808003 good old fashioned shoe leather reporting coupled with guesswork his staff spent more than 25 hours watching people buy iphones in apple stores
3808004 munster estimates apples retail stores are each selling an average 95 iphones per day up from about 21 a day last august
3808005 i got on the phone and called my wife and made sure that they were safe
3808006 ironically we came through security at the same time we were thankful to be here and to be able to race
3808007 we really spent the last three days making sure that we were focused within ourselves not being afraid of failure and not letting that fear get in the way of having a good race
3808008 because the fear and the nerves can get to you and overcome your sense of ease that makes you row a lot better we just went out there trying to be focused and be loose
3808009 we just went through that over and over and over
3808010 we have a lot of confidence in our crew and we know from previous races this summer that we continually progress throughout the racing we seem to get better and better
3808011 i think we were all quite confident that this would be a much better performance than our heats
3808012 weve come to this level for the pure love and joy of the sport
3808013 anything above that is a bonus but i think its excellent for the next generation of athletes that we would have this kind of incentive program
3808014 it just seemed that this was a mark that was sustainable
3808015 its not one where we would throw these great numbers out there and then all of a sudden get to the next games and not be able to reward them
3808016 what we first and foremost said is that wed like it to be equal a medal should be a medal
3808017 our number one priority was to make sure we rewarded every individual medal the same way whether it came from an individual or a team
3808018 we want to retain those particular athletes as long as we can
3808019 not only to hopefully win more medals but more importantly to have younger athletes learn from them
3808020 we need to help those who are breaking onto the scene
3808021 i think that money should maybe be allocated somewhere else until we have a bigger pot
3808022 in a lot of cases its several years out that theyre looking at identifying those athletes and making sure theyre being brought through that whole cycle
3808023 i think its an important step just in terms of culture in canada to say that we are going to value medals beyond just a pat on the back
3808024 i think that until we sort of say that we can be winners and we expect to be winners which is what offering those incentives does i think that were not going to be the number one nation in 2010 or beyond
3808025 its maybe not the numbers that people would like it to be
3808026 but i think its a step in the right direction
3808027 i know this guy who can fix her right up
3808028 at the heart of the matter is mr capras methodology his use of what seem to me to be accidental similarities of language as if these were somehow evidence of deeply rooted connections

3808084 doctors dont want patients to suffer they want people to get better
3808085 but they feel stress they feel time constraints they have to deal with pre authorizations its not the kind of practice they wanted theyre stressed and that leads to moving patients along
3808086 as a doctor in todays medical system its difficult to deal with chronic pain conditions
3808087 most practices are forced to see a certain number of patients in a limited amount of time with chronic pain its not so simple as five minutes a few questions and handing out a pill it takes some time and our system isnt set up for that
3808088 the patient needs to realize that the doctor may not be able to discern whats going on in the first visit often it takes a few visits
3808089 if you say its really depressing and upsetting me im in so much pain
3808090 doctors will see it in terms of emotion and treat it as an emotional problem referring you to psychiatric care or antidepressants
3808091 patients really need to be persistent about their complaints in a way that is constructive to get across to the physician that this is something real

3808096 ive trained for so many years for this my coach gave me a slap too anything to take the pain away from my back
3808097 ive had scans and everything it was decided that competing would cause no further damage
3808098 i struggled i had a back injury coming into the competition if the situation had been different i would probably have pulled out a couple of weeks ago but there was nobody to replace me
3808099 i just tried to dig deep and get through the training so i could make it to beijing
3808100 i was in some discomfort in training and only managed to snatch up to 75kg in training and only clean and jerked 85kg
3808101 its not that the weights felt heavy the problem was the pain i was in but after so many years of training to get this far i didnt want to pull out
3808102 my time was pretty average i have had a lot of experience at 200 of going out too fast and struggling at the end at the worlds i went off ridiculously fast and got smashed on the last 50 but i have learned from my mistakes
3808103 im very optimistic about the fact that a year from now or a year and a half from now the market will be very high

3808110 bill gates once asked me could you make me more human
3808111 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3808112 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3808113 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3808114 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3808115 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3808116 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3808117 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3808118 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3808119 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3808120 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets
3808121 at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3808122 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3808123 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3808124 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market
3808125 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far

3808132 after we lost game 2 a handful of us sat around drinking some beers after the other team had left we figured we had to do something to change our luck we werent hitting and just lost with our ace on the hill even though he allowed only 2 runs so we buried a full flying dog beer tire bite label up in the pitchers mound right behind the pitching rubber at their field we have not lost since coincidence

3808427 i heard a rather liberal gop political consultant here in raleigh say today that health care is too complicated to be a deciding issue in the elections it cant be summarized in 30 seconds its just too hard
3808428 oh god its wonderful to get out of bed and drink too much coffee and smoke too many cigarettes and love you so much

3808434 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
3808435 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
3808436 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
3808437 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
3808438 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
3808439 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
3808440 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
3808441 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist

3808458 how many lives were lost during your tragic vote or die campaign in 2004 when will your savage thirst for blood be slaked
3808459 what have i ever done what have you ever done aside from you know launching a multimillion dollar media empire lording over a hugely successful clothing line shaping the career of perhaps the greatest mc of all time scoring a series of hits as both a producer and a solo artist and running in the new york city marathon on a whim actually wait never mind
3808460 your skin is way smoother than i wouldve imagined given the amount of times i have seen your proactiv commercial
3808461 in tons how many magick talismans ancient tomes aleister crowley artifacts did it take to convince jimmy page to appear in the video for that god awful song you did on the godzilla soundtrack
3808462 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag
3808463 thank you for not beating me with a champagne bottle or a telephone receiver

3808466 for narrow stairs the majority of the songs i brought in were guitar songs songs we could sit in a room and just play
3808467 i can honestly say i had more fun and felt more inspired on this record than anything that we had done in a long time
3808468 the most important thing was the vocal to capture the balance of me delivering the songs with full gusto and at the same time retaining the grain and the grit
3808469 he is a dreamboat if i were that age and single id be in so much trouble
3808470 i said youd be exactly my type he liked it he was like that would be great i was of course teasing but of course not teasing
3808471 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
3808472 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
3808473 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
3808474 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
3808475 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
3808476 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
3808477 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
3808478 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3808479 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3808480 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
3808481 the internet community has become very polarized either you liked this book or you hated this book we took a stance that if you liked the book were going to be a place for discussion about that
3808482 we know that it was a disgruntled fan of the series who hacked our system it took place as a direct result of the lexicons backing of stephenie meyer and her work
3808483 if you were posting on every thread on our forums stephenie meyer is a terrible writer everything about it is horrible then we just arent the place for you
3808484 as her official fan site this needs to be a positive place where we can gather together and discuss what we like and have positive conversation hate spam makes it very difficult for someone to enjoy the site
3808485 if you hit the site with enough traffic its security measures begin to fall the message board had been spammed and it allowed a hole in the security net that somebody was able to get through and delete forums
3808486 because of the spamming there were so many ip addresses there is no shortage of suspects and no way to know which one exactly did the attack
3808487 the hole that enabled them to get into the blog has been sealed as far as contacting law enforcement we have been in contact with our server company and there are definite measures being taken to ensure that this doesnt happen again
3808488 its a very difficult time for the fandom in that you liked it or you really hated it everyone feels like they need to get their say but that means that the fans that really liked it need to have their site too the blog is that place for these ladies and a few men who have been worshipping this book for years
3808489 for those who were disappointed go be passionate about something else
3808490 the park service needs restrooms and this is how theyre getting them
3808491 were not ever really with people cause were always traveling
3808492 and you get on the phone and theyre like my day is awful blah and youre like this is not what i need right now
3808493 this is hard but if they are nagging and annoying youre like go away
3808494 we are secret agents and our cover is that were a band
3808495 everyone knew it was going to be about spies and thats changed a little bit i guess cause in the course of the last two years the band has changed a little bit were going to be the jonas brothers going through life like going to school but still being the jonas brothers
3808496 i love ben stiller and we met him just recently
3808497 it was weird writing a song talking about a boy
3808498 we were like so this is what girls go through
3808499 this is something major for the streets a lot of people who didnt or who dont normally get love from other outlets can count on ozone to shed some light on them
3808500 after all these years the only award ive ever received was a ozone award
3808501 so i love the show its the third year it keeps getting better
3808502 i have never been considered a part of the religious right because i dont believe politics is the most effective way to change the world
3808503 although public service can be a noble profession and i believe it is our responsibility to vote i dont have much faith in government solutions given the track record its why i am a pastor not a politician none of my values have changed from four years ago but my agenda has definitely expanded
3808504 i want whats good for everybody not just whats good for me whos the best for the nation right now
3808505 our lives are but a little while so let them run as sweetly as you can and give no thought to grief from day to day for time is not concerned to keep our hopes but hurries on its business and is gone
3808506 i think it is more urban this is my best work ever
3808507 working with a team of top notch producers and songwriters
3808508 for it is god who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure
3808509 unser nachbar hat sein wahres gesicht gezeigt das wir seit jahrhunderten kennen es ist russland das sich seine nachbarl nder unterordnen will wir sagen dazu nein
3808510 es war eine vom pr sidenten selbst verfasste rede deren inhalt dem au enministerium vorher nicht bekannt war
3808511 eine derartige aggression und einen solchen hass hat es noch nicht gegeben zum ersten mal gibt es nicht einmal in strategischen fragen wie sicherheit und au enpolitik einen konsens
3808512 noch retten uns gutes wasser guter boden und gutes management in der gesamtwertung
3808513 eine bernahme der aua durch die lufthansa h tte den gr ten negativen einfluss auf den flughafen wien
3808514 die gro e frage ist k mpft die aua auf der seite der lufthansa oder traut sie sich zu als mitglied im skyteam gegen den versch rften wettbewerb in ihren hauptm rkten anzutreten
3808515 w hrend der gro teil der bev lkerung in armut lebt verdienen sich einige mit illegalen mitteln dumm und d mlich schuld daran ist die korrupte wirtschaftspolitik
3808516 garcia sagt zwar er k mpft gegen die drogenbosse ich glaube ihm das aber nicht
3808517 garcia hat in den 80er jahren versagt genauso wird er jetzt wieder versagen
3808518 wir haben bis jetzt nie den besten pr sidenten f r peru gew hlt sondern den am wenigsten schlechten ein wirklich guter kandidat stand nie zur auswahl
3808519 eine chinesin hatte ja noch eine zahnl cke wo gerade ein milchzahn herausgefallen ist ich bin berzeugt dass zumindest drei turnerinnen das mindestalter noch nicht erreicht haben
3808520 nie im leben sind die 16 sie sind 12 h chstens 14 jahre alt ich bin viele jahre turn trainer gewesen und ich wei wie m dchen mit 14 15 oder 16 aussehen
3808521 aber die meiste frustration habe ich wegen der arroganz der chinesen die denken doch wirklich wir sind alle dumm
3808522 es darf doch nicht sein dass solche kinder sich hier durchsetzen ich hatte gehofft dass sich die fraulichkeit der amerikanerinnen durchsetzt
3808523 ich bin 16 jahre alt und was andere sagen interessiert mich nicht
3808524 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3808525 im an illiterate who has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that i can get
3808526 you dont necessarily have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country john mccain is aware of the internet
3808527 basically john is a technological troglodyte and proud of it
3808528 broadband will soon be an indispensable communication technology affecting the way we learn the way we work and the way we communicate
3808529 however at the dawn of this digital age those who could benefit the most from this economically empowering technology are also those most likely to be left without access because of where they live or how much money they make
3808530 the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength
3808531 what concerns me is that mccain will do as george bush did which is to make technology an issue related to how he raises money to run the government or to fund campaigns and not as an independent issue that is important to grow america
3808532 technology for the bush administration is a total non issue even though that was the thing that drove most growth in 1992 to 2003 and the reason i think hed be led to that is because hes a guy who doesnt understand anything about technology in the first place
3808533 i think that the people who determine his tech policies like former fcc chairman michael powell and a few others who were his top advisors will talk as bush has talked about getting advanced telecommunications services to all americans
3808534 but mainly their model is to allow the industry to determine what all this means which is the danger
3808535 far too little oversight to the good things in the 1996 telecommunications act
3808536 making sure there were equal opportunities to participate in the industry afforded to women and minorities and small businesses
3808537 there was a rush to essentially allow industry players to get into each others businesses and consolidate in the industry
3808538 their bush and mccain belief is that government should just get out of the way and let the private sector do it clearly in the financial markets the private sector has done a horrible job
3808539 then we got another bill telling us that they will disconnect all our services within 10 days and put us in touch with a debt collection agency
3808540 its just a penny i asked if i could put it on our direct debit and they said they could not do that it is ridiculous
3808541 they were very apologetic and they are looking in to the matter and having an internal inquiry
3808542 they have given me a full apology and a bouquet of flowers it has taken the lincolnshire echo to do something for bt to get it sorted
3808543 speriamo di non dover mai tirare quella leva ma sarebbe stato da irresponsabili non averla

3808546 is how powerful it is each morning when everybody gets around the table and actually goes through what theyve done basically saying
3808547 a lot of developers tend to be quiet and not the most social what this did is that it just didnt allow the few people who were social to have input on what was going on this daily stand up had people everybody on the team contributing and it really changed the relationships in the team it was just a very very powerful thing
3808548 i am a doc writer and i cant contribute on requirements
3808549 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
3808550 reflect s the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
3808551 pings and plinks and whirs and clatters like a toy machine but its also made with the understanding that when programmed correctly robots can convey the soul sick pathos of grieving poets
3808552 it is a crime for people with access to antiretrovirals to continue to die from tb
3808553 i gnoring tb screening and care undermines all the gains made in hiv treatment
3808554 its the most exciting thing on the horizon and its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3808555 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are into it its been a fun thing
3808556 but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right
3808557 fired its high energy chemical laser through its beam control system the beam control system acquired a ground target and guided the laser beam to the target as directed by atls battle management system

3808564 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3808565 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3808566 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3808567 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3808568 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3808569 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3808570 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3808571 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital

3808665 road mortality is a significant factor of influencing snake populations around the world
3808666 in southern alberta its particularly important because the snakes arent moving very fast across the roads and there is a huge amount of development

3808668 im going to ask the court not to allow it it means it can go ahead but only after environmental assessments have taken place and proper consultations have taken place to make this a viable and better project
3808669 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3808670 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3808671 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3808672 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3808673 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3808674 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3808677 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3808678 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3808679 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3808680 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3808681 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3808682 we continue to stress our defense and really work hard at that end of the floor

3808697 i think interfaith marriage works in this country because we have a history of practicing tolerance of other faiths
3808698 not too long ago i performed a ceremony for a woman who was muslim and a man who was jewish and both wanted to continue to practice their own faiths they planned to expose their children to both and let them make their own choices
3808699 many of their relatives died in the holocaust and our kids will know about their history

3808703 i wanted to be sure he would never feel out of place and i was extraordinarily lucky

3808708 we measure the hell out of it every meeting starts with discussing the customer experience that said we have a long way to go and people have long memories thats part of the urgency we know its going to take a while to get customers to actually perceive that service has improved

3808710 they didnt dupe me i dont think they knew either
3808711 sirius and xm have had their fair share of iphone related applications and buzz first there was official word from xm of an xm radio mobile app for the iphone then came usirius and uxm to the mix but there hasnt been much word on the mysterious streamsmart project which promised a common platform for playing sirius xm on multiple devices including the iphone
3808712 that is until we got our hands on some details and screenshots from a covert operative inside the alpha team

3808726 because of its ties with the program this new fund can provide access to firms that other limited partners might not have entree to
3808727 building a new firm that invests with the very best venture and growth equity firms has required considerable effort and we have been thrilled with the support we have received receiving support from the outstanding general partners in which we have invested from the terrific base of limited partners in our fund and from cve and the kauffman fellows has been extremely gratifying

3808754 yes the market has now slowed down considerably but as a public policy matter if developers are receiving tax breaks to build housing then a percentage of that housing should be affordable to the community
3808755 otherwise the government is subsidizing the development of luxury housing
3808756 the industry would like to wipe out the whole bill
3808757 before we signed on to 421 a lopez made it very clear to me that we could amend our districts later
3808758 they didnt understand that a lot of these neighborhoods added to the exclusion area were marginal markets and the fact is the markets in those communities werent strong enough to put market and affordable apartments in the same building
3808759 will require developers of affordable housing to rely upon government subsidy as opposed to the equity that was realized from the sale of certificates

3808766 one they have to give up 20 percent of their direct payment the direct payment is just a flat payment that they get every year regardless of commodity prices regardless of what they produce theyd have to give up their counter cyclical program payments then theyd also have to reduce the marketing loan rates by 30 percent for the marketing loan program
3808767 so it is definitely something theyll have to give up and theyll have to weigh what they give up versus what they think they may potentially gain out of the acre program

3809035 there was a 2 minute delay so the world feed could get alicias routine into the world feed
3809036 that was unfortunate but it is not unusual the hold could have had an effect on alicia
3809037 i have no way to know it possibly could be possibly not
3809038 i told her alicia they tried to break your focus you let them do that never let them do that we work on that

3809044 public employees are a direct line of defense against waste fraud and abuse ab 2001 gives local government employees a confidential avenue to report possible misuses of government resources this is a piece of legislation which was long overdue and my colleagues joined me in widespread support for more transparent government
3809045 this is great news we are one step closer to ensuring that whistleblowers in cities like oakland and counties throughout california will be protected this legislation is critical to encourage and protect government employees who speak out against fraud waste and abuse ultimately the citizens will reap the benefits
3809046 ab 2001 safeguards the anonymity that municipal and county employees need to report abuses without fear of reprisal this is a vital component to maintaining transparency in government

3809062 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3809063 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3809064 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3809065 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3809066 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3809067 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3809068 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3809069 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win

3809096 and that is the thing about life you go walking along thinking people are talking a language and exchanging ideas but the whole time there is this deeper language people are really talking and that language has nothing to do with ethics fashion or politics but what it really has to do with is feeling important and valuable what if the economy were really dealing in life what if the language we are really speaking in life what if what we really want in life is relational

3809112 both connelly and bellamy bring relevant skills but they lack experience in the healthcare sector or nhs
3809113 a similar lack of understanding of the nhs has led to problems in the past within connecting for health so it is vital that they are brought up to speed quickly and make an effort to win over sceptical clinicians
3809114 both connelly and bellamy are experienced cios and used to running large it projects both will also bring skills from the private sector as is increasingly common for public sector cios neither of them are career civil servants

3809122 hes actually pro war cause he went through it and he had a positive experience
3809123 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3809124 systemic antibiotics pills or injections as opposed to creams were implicated in 19 3 percent of all emergency department visits for drug related adverse events
3809125 persons aged 15 44 years accounted for an estimated 41 2 percent of ed visits infants accounted for only an estimated 6 3 percent of ed visits
3809126 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events
3809127 antibiotics are among the most frequently used medications in the united states annually antibiotics are prescribed to an estimated 16 percent of patients during ambulatory care visits and pharmaceutical manufacturers spend 1 billion promoting antibiotics
3809128 i was in complete shock i hadnt thought about anything but having another baby with this donor it was just so surprising and bewildering
3809129 id love to give him a full sibling but i just couldnt do it its so unfortunate
3809130 in addition to being tall and well educated their motivations for donation are quite sincere they want to help childless couples they tended to sell out very fast
3809131 theres a huge demand and the fda is essentially saying to these patients they cant choose the characteristics of the children they want even though there is absolutely no scientific evidence on their side
3809132 revenant is a superhero book filtered through the lens of slasher horror
3809133 its a story of revenge told from the perspective of a band of gangsters who have risen to power in sapphire city
3809134 at the center is a guy named danny risk his nightclub is a haven for these crime lords to meet and do business but we get a sense that theres more to danny that first appears
3809135 shannon and keith saw the character more as a shadow or spider type
3809136 when i took over i sort of recast the book as a horror story or a splatter story anyway the revenant is a very cruel character he isnt content to simply stop the bad guys he wants to kill them in a horrific manner and taunt them while hes doing it
3809137 im more and more a fan of the graphic novel format mainly because i cant remember the stories i read a month earlier
3809138 the revenant is pretty fast paced and having the entire story under one cover suits it better desperado was agreeable eager even to publish it as such the shift has allowed us to expand the story help it breath and flow a bit better there are 20 additional story pages in the graphic novel that would not have been possible if we were constrained to a miniseries format
3809139 ive also written comics adaptations of three volumes of a very famous kids book series but i cant name that either

3809142 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3809143 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3809144 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3809145 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3809146 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3809147 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3809148 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3809149 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3809150 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3809151 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3809152 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3809153 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3809154 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3809155 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3809156 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3809157 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3809158 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3809159 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3809160 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3809161 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3809162 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3809163 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3809164 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3809165 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3809166 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3809167 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3809168 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3809169 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3809170 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3809171 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3809172 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3809173 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3809174 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3809175 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3809176 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3809177 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3809178 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3809179 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3809180 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3809181 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3809182 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3809183 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3809184 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3809185 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3809186 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3809187 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3809188 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3809189 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humour and the familiar comfort of his voice
3809190 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3809191 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3809192 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3809193 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3809194 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3809195 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3809196 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3809197 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3809198 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3809199 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3809200 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3809201 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3809202 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3809203 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3809204 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3809205 hes my first true love since rod and the age difference isnt an issue

3809219 at least one deal on the table that will move bryan out of toronto
3809220 all is not as quiet as it appears and a major announcement will take place in the next 7 10 days that will define sundins future
3809221 however i dont think the teams have the slightest idea what team he will pick
3809222 sundin is playing this year in the nhl however we have yet to see the scope of the bidding at this point since sundins statement in early july many more teams are in the game he is a high powered addition and certain teams do believe he is the missing piece
3809223 look out for colorado with mats i am not convinced that sakic and sundin arent talking or in on something together
3809224 it is a tough sell to let him back to the preds if for some reason he does decide to return the preds fans and the people in tennessee feel completely betrayed here they will let him go for almost nothing based on principle there is a reason terrell owens has never played for the titans that game wouldnt fly here
3809225 two big time arguably future all star forwards are on the table but there is more to it than that dig deeper and you will find another team is trying to snag the montreal kid and may have a better package to offer
3809226 there are some pretty confused people by many of fletchers moves and yet it also is widely looked at that cliff may actually be setting things up to stay in the gm role for a while

3809229 im a little lucky to get through to round three with second placings but hopefully tomorrow i can start to win
3809230 im riding my team manager sasha stockers boards and just getting used to them at this stage and i need to adjust the waves are great though and by tomorrow i should be good hopefully

3809232 school wasnt working for me at the start of the year so i figured it was time to really work on my surfing ive spent a lot of time surfing indonesia and new zealand recently and im feeling good for a strong result but its an outstanding field here and this will be a hard event to win

3809472 it may look like the current award winning c class but the clc sits on a seven year old chassis of the previous and smaller c class
3809473 the new car certainly makes a good first impression the new front end is bolder and sportier with the mercedes star prominent on the wider front grille no one is going to be in any doubt you bought a mercedes at the rear the look is cleaner with a new rear tailgate design that does away with the old car s rear wing which hampered rear vision and replaces it with a more subtle lip spoiler from the side the car is more or less unchanged inside there are new seats and trim but the dashboard and centre console are carried over from the previous model it looks a little plain and dated unless you tick the box for the optional satellite navigation screen which costs 3202 on the two cheaper models and 4163 on the most expensive variant courtesy of the luxury car tax which applies only to the top spec model the seats which are a mix of cloth and artificial leather on the base model and artificial leather on the more expensive variants are built for comfort rather than support which is a little at odds with the look and feel of the car rear legroom is very good for a coupe and entry into the two rear seats is fuss free even for taller people headroom in the rear is a little tight although overall it is more comfortable than most coupes the interior load area is also very practical for a coupe the split fold rear seats fold flat and give you a generous 1100 litres of cargo space if required underneath the rear floor is a space saver temporary spare on the road the coupe shows its age the suspension gets unsettled over choppy surfaces and the body tends to flex shifting the car s weight and your head from side to side over undulations the ride is firm but reasonably comfortable at low speeds on poor surfaces it can get too busy though you can t help but feel that mercedes engineers given seven years to work on a new suspension could have come up with an improvement the steering isn t as sharp and communicative as the bmw 1 series coupe although it is predictable and feels well weighted on the open road the more expensive versions had mercedes new direct steering system which requires lighter effort around town while retaining a solid feel at high speeds the car still feels secure and stable at high speed and through corners while it s no out and out sports car it is reasonably entertaining to drive on a winding road the 1 8 litre supercharged engine is willing enough when revved but is no rocket from a standing start the five speed automatic transmission doesn t do the engine many favours either we didn t get the opportunity to sample the six speed manual transmission but suspect it may squeeze more out of the engine and make for a more entertaining drive wind and road noise are reasonably well suppressed but cabin refinement is not at the same level as the c class sedan released last year overall the clc has a good deal to recommend it it is well priced looks the part has the right badge on the grille and has genuine four seater room inside but scratch the surface and you may feel shortchanged it still rides and handles as well as a lot of less prestigious european brands though ultimately it doesn t represent the cutting edge of german automotive engineering nor does the cabin scream luxury

3809520 esto es signo de que las cadenas estamos empezando a tener m s paciencia con los nuevos contenidos que ponemos en marcha porque la mayor fragmentaci n por la diversidad de cadenas as lo exige

3809534 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3809535 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3809536 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make

3809550 gandhi believed in serving humanity and seva bharati is also doing the same
3809551 any award named after mahatma gandhi should only be conferred on an institution or a person dedicated to gandhian principles but the award conferred on an organisation allied to the rss raises doubts on the intentions of the government already working on saffron agenda it is an insult to gandhi

3809683 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos

3809801 unglaublich ich muss das erstmal begreifen die vier gefechte waren doch alle relativ deutlich das ist ziemlich ungew hnlich f r so einen gro en wettkampf ohne mindestens einmal im sudden death zu landen ich glaube ich h tte den druck nicht ausgehalten
3809802 das ist meine art ich glaube sonst h lt man den stress nicht aus ich war beim halbfinale kurz davor zusammenzubrechen vor lauter stress und im finale habe ich beschlossen das ganze so konzentriert anzugehen dass ich hoch f hre dass das so gut klappen w rde konnte ich nicht ahnen

3809850 what this adds up to however while we may have have a ceasefire on the ground this is an extraordinary show of russian force
3809851 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
3809852 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
3809853 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3809854 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3809855 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
3809856 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
3809857 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3809858 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
3809859 balkan type and world war ii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
3809860 we are getting reports of large scale violation of human rights of the worst of the case
3809861 the town of tskhinvali was turned into grozny two by russian carpet bombardment and i really want people to go in and check and verify what kind of bombs are these
3809862 our students have been working hard to meet the rigor of our english ii state assessment and their efforts have also paid off in increased act scores
3809863 as we continue to raise the bar in other grades and subjects we can expect continued improvement in student performance on the college entrance exam
3809864 the increased rigor of the curriculum and assessments will help our students to be ready for careers and college
3809865 we call upon the nation to observe three days of mourning and hold peaceful demonstrations

3809873 we however note apple products typically carry low margins and strong initial sales could negatively impact best buys gross margin
3809874 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3809875 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3809876 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3809877 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3809878 in the 3 years barack obama has been in the senate with all respect there is very little evidence of that kind of bipartisan outreach
3809879 john mccain has lived it worked it done it thats why i think in the end which is election day which we hope is just the beginning there are going to be many more democrats who will vote for john mccain than republicans who will vote for barack obama
3809880 the things he can control on inventory he really has done a terrific job
3809881 its going to be difficult for them and everybody else
3809882 there is going to be a lot of smoke damage
3809883 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3809884 soldiers dont have to shoulder the cost of any baggage when they travel
3809885 when youre making 16 000 a year like a junior enlisted person 100 is a chunk of change
3809886 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3809887 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3809888 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3809889 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3809890 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3809891 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3809892 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3809893 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3809894 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win
3809895 i was more or less sort of counting strokes i sort of know how many strokes i take for 50 and i was hoping that i would be dead on
3809896 it was a best time but i was just disappointed
3809897 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3809898 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3809899 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3809900 were here to help people take their location to the web by giving them the ability to control how much detail about their location they want to share and which applications they want to share it with
3809901 although the impact on their web sites is clear i believe this may end up being just some kids who got overexcited with georgia being ill prepared to say the least
3809902 while georgia is obviously under a ddos attacks and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online aftermath by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizers
3809903 there certainly was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and ive also felt it was a misplaced cockiness
3809904 youve got a lot of conditions that are similar to 1932 and similar to 1980 a very unpopular president and the party brand badly hurt
3809905 but we wont know if its going to happen until late
3809906 i dont think you see leads in presidential races over 5 points in this day and age hes averaged leads of 3 points since spring the key is that obama hasnt closed the sale
3809907 it wasnt until reagan reached the threshold that he was able to close the sale
3809908 there is something about obama that is causing something of drag
3809909 this may sound kind of harsh but if the democratic nominee were a white male from a red or purple state the theory would be dead on that this would be set up there would be a very very high probability for a democratic landslide
3809910 youve never had a young guy win by such a large margin post war
3809911 significant parts of the book whose subtitle is leftist politics and the cult of personality have already been challenged as misleading or false in the days since its debut on aug 1 nonetheless it is to make its first appearance on the new york times best seller list for nonfiction hardcovers this sunday at no 1 the book is being pushed along by a large volume of bulk sales intense voter interest in mr obama and a broad marketing campaign that has already included 100 author interviews with talk radio hosts across the country like sean hannity and g gordon liddy mr corsi said on tuesday

3809913 billions in tax breaks for companies who ship american jobs overseas
3809914 but his past words say it all obamas claim is true
3809915 one prominent moderate republican not joining the group chuck hagel the senator from nebraska a representative for sen hagel said he will not be joining the group endorsing a candidate or attending either convention
3809916 forget blogs the bookworld may still be the best place to push false truths about someone
3809917 in the book world there is no fact checking a la the msm and the credibility a hardcover gives to a charge is something the msm at least fox news ends up covering

3809928 how many people can you find who have a good heart to help other people in this world
3809929 we could see there were people inside but there was nothing you could do it was horrible
3809930 one hundred feet in either direction and he could have hit some cars
3809931 i hope one day that things will be back to normal
3809932 i would love to be able to sit up and watch television with him after the kids have gone to bed i guess i can keep hoping and praying
3809933 they were good neighbors and it was just a tragic loss
3809934 it was really a brand new plane if there were any problems it wouldnt have been cleared to fly
3809935 he was the kind of guy you could go to when you had a question about process or procedure
3809936 he was someone who worshipped the process and followed the rules he had opinions but he put the process above anything else
3809937 he was a guy who was public spirited and public minded
3809938 regardless of which side of the issue people were on they all respected joe
3809939 i think hes crashed his altitude went up down up down and then he disappeared off the radar at really low altitude
3809940 people rushed over and tried to help but it was just too late the flames were too intense
3809941 we ran outside we saw the flames and the smoke and we could just see the tail of the plane
3809942 i was surprised by the mistakes made by the u s team
3809943 they had a great meet a great day and they deserve that medal
3809944 give us another day and maybe well come out on top
3809945 before this i said i would feel that no matter if it is failure or victory it will be wonderful
3809946 that is what i told myself so no matter the final results i was able to feel very calm
3809947 after falling off the beam i told myself i need to do well for the rest of the routine and perform my best so i quickly adjusted myself
3809948 in this sport you know there are two reasons youre going to be held one is for scoring one is for television
3809949 in no way shape or form are we blaming anyone for this

3809951 she kept telling us she was sorry but its really hard to know what to say
3809952 you know she obviously didnt purposely make the mistake it was obvious it was just a mistake
3809953 and but i still didnt know what this ampers business was all about
3809954 and per se and and per se and and per se and andperseand ampersand
3809955 mccain has a really likeable list then again hitler liked some good music you know
3809956 mahmouds passing away is very sad for us as a company it is very strange to be performing jidariyya which is about a dialogue with death and to be performing it just after his passing away
3809957 it is all very strange and sad for us but he still lives on in his words and his spirit and his generosity
3809958 he muses on the poems he did not write on his first love his dreams and all the experiences that make up his personality and his culture
3809959 the triumph of poetry over death signals the dawning of resurrection
3809960 so it has that double meaning of life clinging on and some piece of art that stays for centuries
3809961 not by having a ceremony but by the fact that we will be celebrating his work on the stage

3809998 i mean they made it seem like any coloradan could go and now you have to work for your ticket
3809999 my experience matches what you are hearing from other sources because of my work schedule and other activities going on i did not sign up for the all star tickets but i was called by the campaign and told that i had to volunteer this week in order to get tickets at all i finally agreed to one three hour shift but it left a bad impression for this lifelong democrat
