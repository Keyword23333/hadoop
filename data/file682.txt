6820032 the war on southern ossetia was not meant to be won leading to the restoration of georgian sovereignty over south ossetia it was intended to destabilize the region while also triggering a us nato confrontation with russia
6820033 are we dealing with an act of provocation with a view to triggering a broader conflict supported by media propaganda the western military alliance is intent on using this incident to confront russia as evidenced by recent nato statements

6820043 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rss rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vhp vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
6820044 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
6820045 an appropriate way to deal with the situation would be to constitute a high level committee comprising secular minded judicial luminaries like justice sachar justice krishna iyer and justice aa ahmadi it could even have representatives of hindu organizations like rss and vhp let them question the arrested young muslim boys and if the committee is convinced that they are actually involved in terrorism let them be hanged
6820046 but what the investigating agencies are doing today is grossly unfair they were all declared as terrorists well before any trial and this is what needs to be stopped

6820141 i think the major difference between us is that i believe people need to be stood up for and that takes precedence over economics i do not hear anything in your 4 items that protects the people i love proactively well besides their being blown up
6820142 the last sentence to me their right not to be blown up is a pretty big deal however as for protecting the people you love my things are 1 lower taxes 2 kill terrorists 3 less regulation 4 more freedom and liberty so how does that connect to the down trodden the tired the poor etc the left believes that government handouts are compassion the left which i do not include you in you are center left has absolutely destroyed the very people they claim to care about welfare destroys poor people especially black people it traps them in a never ending cycle of dependency conservatives wanted to reform welfare to give these people dignity we were castigated for it but the 1995 welfare reform law worked in 1965 the late democratic senator pat moynihan decried the black illegitimacy rate he said it would destroy their communities he and others were deemed racists he and they were right 70 of black children are born out of wedlock and these kids have a much lesser chance of escaping the hellish cycle of illegitimacy combined with welfare the left will not allow the teaching of abstinence in schools that is deemed religious abstinence is the only guaranteed way to avoid pregnancy and diseases i see the goal of the left as to get as many people as possible dependent on government that way these people will have to vote for the left once 51 of voters need government to survive democrats will win every election the left does not care about these people they use them to maintain power when poor people are able to become self sufficient this threatens the left when black people become conservative they are called uncle toms so how do we help the poor and the downtrodden we let those that do it best do it and ask those that make things worse get out of the way businesses and faith based institutions get things done because they have to governments dont because they cant if a business loses money shareholders get angry ceos get fired governments just create more money for themselves faith based institutions are not religious zealots they are people who believe god commands them to help the downtrodden the left is hostile towards these people simply because they happen to be religious the answer is mass privatization the government should protect the country military and little else i would privatize the post office and virtually everything else the left is about intentions the right cares about results we may come across as mean or uncaring but we are not into useless symbolic displays of affection that make matters worse 4 decades have passed since the great society and their vision didnt work conservatism is not warm and fuzzy nor is it perfect but it actually works black home ownership has never been higher black americans have never had such political power stem cell research is now legal gays have never had as much freedom this all happened under president bush who even back in college absolutely refused to gay bash when goaded by his other frat friends also womens rights have never been higher yes the dub is pro life but he also b tchslapped the taliban and saddam allowing women in afghanistan and iraq to have the right to walk in the street without being beaten women worldwide have freedom because of his commitment to ending tyranny people dont know this because the dub doesnt go around taking victory laps bragging about his accomplishments he quietly goes about his business this is why people like me shout from the rooftops because he wont do it we wish he would so we would not have to he wont the fact is that he absolutely does care about the least among us because his faith demands that he does and he is committed to his faith his policies reflect that they are just never talked about conservatives simply let the results speak for themselves we dont like bragging we make the mistake of thinking that we dont need p r so we stop marketing ourselves and find out that we do need p r many on the left have great p r but nothing underneath to back it up people may never know the heroism of john mccain they know he is a hero but they do not know the depths of it if they did he may win 90 of the vote he doesnt talk about it because true heroes dont talk about it in contrast i chest thump after scoring in kickball people who support obama believe he will do great things and he may very well but with mccain we can like him not for what he will do but for what he has already done conservatives absolutely care about the people you care about it we just do more and say less present company exempted the left has better words but the actions dont back them up ok i am have given you enough politics to last a lifetime but this is near and dear to my heart i am very sensitive to the charge of not caring its just wrong

6820178 steve stivers wants to go to washington but he already sounds like george bush
6820179 he said it would be morally wrong to repeal any tax cuts for the wealthy and steve stivers is a former banking lobbyist who is one of only for state senators to vote against cracking down on predatory lending

6820181 with all due respect it is very easy for ceos executives and politicians who all have paid sick days themselves to oppose them for everyone else

6820204 he should start throwing quickly after the cast comes off
6820205 at that moment the whole purpose of my existence dawned upon me because
6820206 i realized that jesus christ shed his blood for me on that cross
6820207 that gave me the courage to live through my imprisonment
6820208 the thing we have to do before we have the reception
6820209 its finding out what do i need to fix what i need to do
6820210 if its left up to me i want to play football i cant stand sitting out
6820211 my feeling about any of his off the field activities will be between me and shawne shawne has many many activities off the field and thats his business along with his agents marketing people publicist and business partners my only hope is that he remembers his high level football performance is what drives his off the field attraction
6820212 so for non lawgeeks this wont seem important but trust me this is huge
6820213 para m se trata de una persona que tiene conocimiento de lo que est haciendo porque esto no es de un ni o es algo realmente impactante porque las patas le colgaban a este animalito lo cort entero el alambre le cercen todas las extremidades
6820214 yo nunca hab a visto algo as me impact con esto es impresionante la maldad que se hace con los animales encuentro que las personas que hacen eso no tienen coraz n o nunca se han arrepentido realmente a veces nos molestan tambi n es cierto pero llegar a hacer esto es algo realmente extremo
6820215 encontramos un acto criminal y que efectivamente es denunciable y que podr a ser sancionable judicialmente
6820216 hemos visto casos como ste que est n amarrados a un huachi hemos visto casos en que se les ha hecho cortes con cortaplumas hachas o disparos nosotros queremos recabar m s antecedentes para instaurar alg n tipo de acci n legal para quienes resulten responsables
6820217 creo que un gatito no merece ese tipo de trato y no me cabe ninguna duda que quien realiza este tipo de acto es gente inadaptada y entre hacer esto con un animal dom stico y hacerlo con otro ser humano no hay mucha distancia y eso es lo preocupante
6820218 it was just one of those long nights that we were great to start with with a great qualifying effort and it went down the drain really quick
6820219 i think weve got as good a shot at getting in as any of the guys in the top 12 to 14
6820220 we knew coming into this season that we would have the speed and we would have the team with the experience that we could be at this point at this time of the year but we just had to make sure that we didnt make any crazy mistakes along the way that would have kept us out
6820221 if i could go back a few races i think we would comfortably in the top 10 but the bottom line is weve had good speed weve had good fortune we havent made many mistakes this year

6820224 right now the challenge for photovoltaics is to make the technology less expensive
6820225 therefore the objective is find new materials and novel device structures for cost effective photovoltaic devices the beauty of organic photovoltaics and organic leds is low cost and flexibility
6820226 these devices can be fabricated by inexpensive solution based processing techniques similar to painting or printing the ease of production brings costs down while the mechanical flexibility of the materials opens up a wide range of applications
6820227 the research at sdsu is focused on new materials with variable band gaps
6820228 the band gap determines how much solar energy the photovoltaic device can absorb and convert into electricity
6820229 were working on synthesizing novel polymers with variable band gaps including high medium and low band gap varieties to absorb the full spectrum of sunlight by this we can double the light harvesting or absorption
6820230 we are working to develop these new light emitting and efficient charge transporting materials to improve the light emitting efficiency of full color displays

6820239 this technology is important because it addresses many issues eliminating waste producing economical fuel quickly and being friendly to our environment
6820240 its a win win for industry and consumers furthermore this technology is ready to be commercialized now and does not require any new scientific or technological breakthroughs to become a reality
6820241 our goal with this technology is to achieve as much as a 2 percent contribution to the nations gasoline demand by 2022 through the building of 200 more bio refineries
6820242 we firmly believe the tees technology combined with the byogy team offers this possibility
6820243 our plan is to produce two and a half billion gallons or more of carbon neutral renewable gasoline per year said daniel l rudnick chief executive officer of byogy we are positioning ourselves not only to handle the opportunity biomass waste streams that are available today but also the sustainable biomass energy crops of the future this green substitute for conventional gasoline is the holy grail of all biofuels

6820256 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
6820257 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
6820258 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories
6820259 sci fi has enjoyed tremendous success with stargate sg 1 and stargate atlantis and were proud to be the home of the new stargate universe
6820260 universe will continue the stargate legacy of vibrant storylines and compelling adventures but will re invent the format in a whole new way

6820274 uninsured drivers dont intentionally try and kill other road users so these laws are unlikely to act as a disincentive to the vast majority of uninsured drivers

6820287 there is no doubt that it is bad news out there right now were seeing a lot of cash flow pressure and insolvencies are going up while others are having to sharpen up their focus considerably on how they manage their cash
6820288 in companies that have world class cash management the credit control people will pick up on problems in the client and supplier base before your sales team get to hear of them
6820289 you have to make sure your processes are efficient all the way through so that you get your invoices out at the right point in time and your documentation is 100 accurate and in place you need to understand when clients do their payment runs and you need to build a relationship with them and stay on top of them
6820290 although the banks are large diversified businesses they are not immune to the major forces affecting the economy and their customers the outlook for the rest of the year and 2009 has to be cautious as there are few signs as yet that wholesale funding and securitisation will return in the immediate future

6820307 at the moment it seems that there might be fewer people driving long distances over this bank holiday weekend
6820308 it would be a very dangerous move to have a situation where the government saw its major role as guaranteeing lending
6820309 there is no reason why in the long run you need any guarantee of lending to the mortgages are increasingly hard to secure as lenders themselves are having difficulty sourcing credit
6820310 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
6820311 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
6820312 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
6820313 it would be great if the country said lets throw the bums out and i didnt have to campaign
6820314 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6820315 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6820316 historically marketing budgets are among the first to be cut in a budget crunch in fact spending more during tough times when competitors may be scaling back is a good way to strategically boost market share because this often helps brands come out ahead when the economy rebounds
6820317 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
6820318 while a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
6820319 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate

6820338 this kind of advanced sophisticated cash management is a hot topic for banks right now it is very good business for them since fees earned from cash management are not related to capital adequacy tests

6820340 i was supposed to come to europe for two years
6820341 its been six were loving it the whole family absolutely loves it its a fantastic experience
6820342 and i think a big chunk of that was her international exposure and her cultural understanding shes been in 32 countries in her life now and shes lived in five and its not bad for an 18 year old i think
6820343 i made a mistake in telling them you dont do that they were really pumped up
6820344 ive been extremely lucky because each time we move the family is positive about it weve had no problems well weve had the typical problems
6820345 but nothing that would force us to go home so its been a super ride
6820346 if this company isnt growing its very hard for the rest of the company to hit its growth targets because everyone has to grow by a factor of 10

6820353 the advent of the capital market explosion of organisations such as hedge funds private equity funds state owned enterprises sovereign wealth funds pension and mutual funds of all varieties and combinations of them all
6820354 has created for corporations and their boards a zoo of owners with different stripes teeth sensors claws vision strength will and attitudes
6820355 today the board of directors sitting amid this complex landscape combined with extensive financial engineering must seek to steer the corporation in a coherent direction somehow considering the values of its owners and being responsive to those values
6820356 due to a combination of one or various investment techniques such as short selling share lending hedging or swap agreements there is often a decoupling between an investors share title and its economic interest in a corporation
6820357 although all the new organisations may indeed be technically defined as shareholders what does each of them value
6820358 what is shareholder value between one investor who will profit from driving the share price down another who wants to take the company private another looking for instant cash and one more who is thinking about long term growth
6820359 companies should start measuring their energy use in january 2009 which will allow for a more accurate forecasting

6820361 for the first time hmrc will have powers to access records before returns are filed turn up unannounced to check the records and routinely have access to business premises and assets
6820362 the revenue has been given new powers and we can assume they intend to use them
6820363 schedule 36 is only 25 pages in length but many of its provisions are controversial and arguably give hmrc much greater powers than those it enjoys under current rules
6820364 further safeguards are then planned in guidance and codes of practice on which hmrc will consult
6820365 this is an example of where we have listened carefully to stakeholders throughout the process the review of powers is a careful process it takes between one and two years to develop each proposal working throughout with business and the professions we have responded to concerns throughout making changes where a clear case to do so was made this approach has been praised by key stakeholders
6820366 schedule 36 was seen as pretty controversial in principle but exactly how worried taxpayers should be depends on how hmrc implements its powers
6820367 we are advising finance directors to have a raids policy in place
6820368 the revenue is unlikely to use these powers on a huge multinational where it could take months to get round one site it is likely to choose companies it can manage
6820369 he had blond hair but he wasnt the sort of washed out scandinavian blond person who desperatly looked as if needed to be dyed tinted hand dipped in something
6820370 becoming increasingly aware of the need to report on such issues in a consistent and transparent manner
6820371 although it remains our objective to introduce a dividend exemption our estimates show that to do so could impose significant costs on the exchequer
6820372 this could be seen as the treasury confirming that it is backing down over its original proposals for wholesale replacement of the cfc rules and opting instead for changes to the existing rules
6820373 however following the recent cadbury schweppes and vodafone judgments there is a huge question mark about the enforceability of these rules in the case of cfcs resident in the european union even after changes from 2007 onwards that were supposed to make the rules compliant with eu law therefore its far from clear to me that relying on changes to the existing rules is a sound strategy until the ultimate outcome of the vodafone case is known even then theres the possibility of a further case to test whether the 2007 changes really do now make the legislation eu compliant
6820374 while the governments delay on implementing these changes is causing companies some confusion it is seriously doubtful that any large company would seek to relocate elsewhere because of the uks tax regime companies want to make tax savings where possible but not usually at the expense of moving operations
6820375 if there are weaknesses in your financial systems it will be punished
6820376 monetary policy cannot and should not try to prevent that adjustment
6820377 the treasurys irritation with the hard line stance of the bank of england has been self evident
6820378 the government will continue to support the mpc in the forward looking decisions it takes consistent with the objectives to maintain price stability and support the governments economic policy including its objectives for growth and employment
6820379 the recipe of raising interest rates pulling the economy down and increasing unemployment compounds the impact of inflation on the poor
6820380 where should we suppose inflation expectations will then stand if this 4 forecast proves correct and what will that do to uk economic stability
6820381 the bank should raise interest rates to re establish its credibility though i doubt its willingness to do this
6820382 the treasury is hoping that interest rates can be cut
6820383 it would not understand a move aimed at bringing down inflation to prepare for stabilising the economy and stimulating growth that chain of cause and effect is not part of treasury thinking
6820384 target growth not inflation is the cry i could not disagree more
6820385 there should be no doubt that the mpc is prepared to take whatever action is needed to return inflation to the 2 target
6820386 if in extreme economic circumstances the national interest demands it the government will have the power to give instructions to the bank on interest rates for a limited period
6820387 the other side of the coin is the us sub prime problem and quite a lot of these instruments are exposed to this market
6820388 the credit crunch for banks is about them having to write down assets that nobody wants to buy the problem at the moment is one of deep uncertainty
6820389 the strategies weve seen reflect the starting points of the different capital positions of each bank
6820390 rbs having just completed the abn amro acquisition saw its capital position as being more stretched than the others and this is reflected in the scale of its 12bn rights issue
6820391 people short rights issues and if the situation deteriorates during the course of the capital raising and share prices fall below the rights price the stock can end up with underwriters this raises the question of the extent to which it was caused by people shorting the stock or whether the banks situation changed during the course of the rights issue
6820392 these wealth funds are not there as a tool of state policy
6820393 but there is a lot of pressure to make these funds more transparent and that reflects some of the concern in the market

6820398 our prayer must not be self centered it must arise not only because we feel our own need as a burden we must lay upon god but also because we are so bound up in love for our fellow men that we feel their need as acutely as our own to make intercession for men is the most powerful and practical way in which we can express our love for them

6820406 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6820407 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6820408 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6820409 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6820410 by 2011 mr robinov plans for dc comics to supply the material for up to two of the six to eight tent pole films he hopes warner bros will have in the pipeline by then
6820411 along those lines we have been developing every dc character that we own
6820412 deals at the top end of the market were hit hard last year and the mid market range had proved more resilient however the latest figures show that the private equity market is now feeling the credit crunch
6820413 the fact is the us central intelligence agency cia taped according to ruskind even the telephone conversation between bhutto and her son bilawal when the mother passed on to the son the details of secret foreign bank accounts where the family loot estimated to run into hundreds of millions of dollars is kept not only that the cia let bhutto know it knew the bank account numbers
6820414 they told stories about how inattentive and inept the president was they said he wouldnt come to work all he wanted to do was to watch movies and television at the residence
6820415 reagans only contribution to the subject of the mx missile throughout the entire hour and a half was to interrupt somewhere at midpoint to tell us hed watched a movie the night before and he gave us the plot from wargames the movie that was his only contribution
6820416 this president is treated by both the press and foreign leaders as if he were a child it is major news when he honors a political or economic discussion with a germane remark and not an anecdote about his hollywood days
6820417 he demonstrated for all to see how far you can go in this life with a smile a shoeshine and the nerve to put your own spin on the facts
6820418 the task of watering the arid desert between reagans ears is a challenging one for his aides
6820419 he has the ability to make statements that are so far outside the parameters of logic that they leave you speechless
6820420 this loathing for government this eagerness to prove that any program to aid the disadvantaged is nothing but a boondoggle and a money gobbler leads him to contrive statistics and stories with unmatched vigor
6820421 president reagan doesnt always check the facts before he makes statements and the press accepts this as kind of amusing
6820422 ronald reagan is the first modern president whose contempt for the facts is treated as a charming idiosyncrasy
6820423 his errors glide past unchallenged at one point he alleged that almost half the population gets a free meal from the government each day no one told him he was crazy the general message of the american press is that yes while it is perfectly true that the emperor has no clothes nudity is actually very acceptable this year

6820427 i have flown twice over mount st helens im not a scientist and i dont know the figures but i have a suspicion that one little mountain out there in these last several months has probably released more sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere than has been released in the last ten years of automobile driving or things of that kind
6820428 growing and decaying vegetation in this land are responsible for 93 percent of the oxides of nitrogen
6820429 approximately 80 percent of our air pollution stems from hydrocarbons released by vegetation so lets not go overboard in setting and enforcing tough emission standards for man made sources
6820430 ive said it before and ill say it again the u s geological survey has told me that the proven potential for oil in alaska alone is greater than the proven reserves in saudi arabia
6820431 trains are not any more energy efficient than the average automobile with both getting about 48 passenger miles to the gallon
6820432 its silly talking about how many years we will have to spend in the jungles of vietnam when we could pave the whole country and put parking stripes on it and still be home by christmas
6820433 i have a feeling that we are doing better in the war in vietnam than the people have been told
6820434 i know all the bad things that happened in that war i was in uniform four years myself
6820435 theyve done away with those committees that shows the success of what the soviets were able to do in this country
6820436 we think there is a parallel between federal involvement in education and the decline in profit over recent years
6820437 what we have found in this country and maybe were more aware of it now is one problem that weve had even in the best of times and that is the people who are sleeping on the grates the homeless who are homeless you might say by choice
6820438 i favor the civil rights act of 1964 and it must be enforced at the point of a bayonet if necessary
6820439 i would have voted against the civil rights act of 1964
6820440 if there has to be a bloodbath then lets get it over with
6820441 today a newcomer to the state is automatically eligible for our many aid programs the moment he crosses the border
6820442 we were told four years ago that 17 million people went to bed hungry every night well that was probably true they were all on a diet
6820443 but i also happen to be someone who believes in tithing the giving of a tenth to charity
6820444 not until now has there ever been a time in which so many of the prophecies are coming together there have been times in the past when people thought the end of the world was coming and so forth but never anything like this
6820445 history shows that when the taxes of a nation approach about 20 percent of the peoples income there begins to be a lack of respect for government when it reaches 25 percent there comes an increase in lawlessness
6820446 because vietnam was not a declared war the veterans are not even eligible for the g i bill of rights with respect to education or anything
6820447 politics is just like show business you have a hell of an opening coast for a while and then have a hell of a close
6820448 everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense

6820501 ada ya rasulullah namun aku sendiri tidak mengetahui apa maksud dari wasiat tersebut
6820502 aku tahu jawaban dari wasiat suamimu ini pada suatu ketika suamimu bertemu dengan seorang gelandangan yang berpakaian tidak layak dan ketika itu suami sedang mengenakan mantel dan juga membawa mantel baru ditangannya lalu gelandangan tersebut meminta pada salah satu dari kedua mantel tersebut maka oleh suamimu diberikanlah mantel yang dikenakannya kepada gelandangan tersebut sedangkan mantel baru yang ditangannya dipakai sendiri
6820503 aku tahu jawaban dari wasiat suamimu ini pada suatu ketika datang pengemis ke rumahnya yang disaat itu suamimu sedang makan pengemis itu meminta pada makanan yang ada oleh suamimu diberikanlah sebagian dari makanannya untuk pengemis itu

6820547 nee ik heb nog niets over het plan gehoord wel heb ik een heel klein stukje erover in de buurtkrant gelezen maar dat was het dan ook maar ik ben sowieso niet van plan om te gaan er is niets dat me bezig houdt in de buurt waarover ik zou willen praten
6820548 we hebben ons een hele tijd bezig gehouden met de vraag hoe kunnen we beter met onze inwoners communiceren we hadden daar een speciale commissie voor en die heeft veel sessies nodig gehad om antwoord te krijgen op deze vraag uiteindelijk leek het ons verstandig om het woord aan de burger te geven

6820600 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6820601 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6820602 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6820603 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6820604 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6820605 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed

6820756 all are here for a reason were confident in our bench i know i can count on them
6820757 but then after a while i got used to it
6820758 that was a wonderful gift for my 11 year old son to put into writing
6820759 i thought that was it that was gift enough for me
6820760 i really wasnt that big a baseball fan until i married my husband he loves baseball
6820761 its so exciting to watch the little kids play it
6820762 its just a great great outing in our community it brings people out and people into our park its just a great way to socialize and have people out in our community
6820763 ive always felt like ive been a leader i just kind of jumped in when they needed help i just always felt like i could make a difference
6820764 if i cant be the guy hustling the most out there
6820765 right now im giving hitting lessons to little kids and ive been working for a web site called free the fan which is basically you tube for sports
6820766 i worked the all star game doing interviews for them but i want to start coaching next year so i figure this is the last summer to have some fun
6820767 i had enough over there and came home the main thing is that im happy with my career im happy with what i did it was time for me to quit because i just wasnt having that much fun anymore
6820768 the reality is when i was with the white sox they said i couldnt play any other positions
6820769 you cant play you dont have the arm you dont have the range you cant do this you cant do that i heard it all billy was the smartest one out of everybody because he knew what i could do
6820770 they always had these guys that were so great ahead of me and then all of a sudden there i was playing thats an accomplishment for me
6820771 nobody wants to be a utility player you want to play every day i think the coaches and the teams want it that way they dont want a guy who is content playing every few days
6820772 that year i had a great first half and everyone was saying it was just a flash in the pan
6820773 but no one realized i got two cortisone shots in my elbow and was playing with a torn quad they threw me out there every day because i was getting the job done defensively and my on base percentage was second on the team to jason giambi
6820774 the way we pulled for each other the way we hung out together we never panicked when everybody around us panicked we never did and we always seemed to turn it on at the right times
6820775 when you look back at the teams we had i sit back scratching my head saying how did we not win a championship
6820776 i know i was liked in oakland because when i came there as a blue jay they booed the heck out of me
6820777 then they gave me a standing ovation when i came up with the bases loaded and the as were killing us i was like oh thanks
6820778 we didnt have a lot of fans in oakland but the fans that did come were great the players there we recognize that
6820779 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can

6820781 if the major political party believes that he is the most talented person then he is the most eligible person for this post

6820783 were going to go all out in the final even if were facing the u s
6820784 indeed against the u s last time we did a terrible job
6820785 well see what happens the u s players are really outstanding
6820786 it was a very tough game against a very good team
6820787 we had a chance to win but we didnt take the spaniards danced at center court after the horn sounded they have won three straight since their whipping by the u s spain defeated angola 98 50 in pool play then beat croatia 72 59 in the quarterfinals
6820788 superman returns didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6820789 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all

6820793 the organization has to create a culture from the top management down that gives people an opportunity to be creative
6820794 it led people to feel there was a lack of trust in their abilities
6820795 during which various dis inhibition gestures utterances and behaviors were exhibited
6820796 my job is if the city council comes to us with a piece of legislation we will look at it we will consider it and well make what i hope is an informed judgment into what is in the best interest in the city
6820797 the city council has the right to change term limits if they want to
6820798 there is this technical imperfection if you will in the existing law that was approved by the public where in theory the city council could go and override the wishes of the public
6820799 it was very very important that the building had not been inspected and we will deal with that

6820844 these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy
6820845 the crucial element was the modelling of the heating and cooling of the gas as this tells us how much mass is needed for part of the gas to have enough gravity to overcome its own gas pressure and thus form a star
6820846 that the stars currently present around the galaxys supermassive black hole have relatively short lifetimes of 10 million years suggests that this process is likely to be repetitive such a steady supply of stars into the vicinity of the black hole and a diet of gas directly accreted by the black hole may help us understand the origin of supermassive black holes in our and other galaxies in the universe

6820850 universe will continue the stargate legacy of vibrant storylines and compelling adventures but will re invent the format in a whole new way
6820851 we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home
6820852 above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories
6820853 merging the very different user experience of the internet with that of the tv is no small task

6820991 hes always had that somewhere between independence and renegade streak
6820992 you dont have to have gray areas on your principles and values but you have to have some compromising postures in order to achieve a common goal
6820993 quick tempers adventurous spirits and love for the countrys uniform
6820994 little short of astonished by the old mans reckless disregard for the rules
6820995 at tea break le duc tho mentioned that drv had intended to release admiral mccains son as one of the three pilots freed recently but he had refused
6820996 now it will be very bad for you mac kane
6820997 never known a prisoner of war who felt he could fully explain the experience to anyone who had not shared it
6820998 thats the most fun ive had since my last interrogation
6820999 i am a black criminal and i have performed deeds of an air pirate
6821000 he had to carry a different burden than most of us and he handled it beautifully
6821001 he didnt need any coping mechanism thats just built into him
6821002 hells bells we were having monday night at the movies tuesday night at the movies wednesday night at the movies featuring john mccain
6821003 we only had the facts half right but john said nobody knew the difference
6821004 as good as any preacher that ever stood at a pulpit
6821005 wasnt a turning point in me as to what type of person i am but it was a bit of a turning point in me appreciating the value of serving a cause greater than your self interest
6821006 that if you put your country first that everything will be ok
6821007 people dont remember how ugly the pow mia issue was
6821008 i heard people scream in his face holding him responsible for the deaths of pows
6821009 everyone knows about his temper his inability to get along with people
6821010 only an a would put together a budget like this
6821011 you are or you arent hes a very straight shooter
6821012 theres nothing unbalanced about it it always makes sense it helps him get the job done
6821013 nobodys going to recruit him to be a zen master
6821014 johns performance over 20 years shows a man who people seek out to do business with because they know hes effective
6821015 he could mock you he could needle you he could belittle you he did it to me on a couple of occasions
6821016 he always said if the opportunity arises again i would love to try it again
6821017 but it wasnt like a dream he couldnt live without
6821018 he put the campaign on his back and climbed up a mountain alone
6821019 he appears to be something different than what he was
6821020 i dont think you get to be 70 years old and then fundamentally change
6821021 mccains gyrations have more to do with figuring out his own party than anything else hes had to sublimate for obvious reasons
6821022 theyre drinking the kool aid that somehow i have changed positions on the issues all i can say is that we all grow we all grow wiser and we all refine our positions
6821023 hes attracted like a moth to the flame to the hard things
6821024 act might be getting a little tired for a man of my years
6821025 american popular culture admits few senior citizens to its ranks of celebrated nonconformists
6821026 we lack the glamorous carelessness of youth and risk becoming parodies of our younger selves
6821027 i hope it means ill still put the country first and my party second
6821028 i hope it means that ill still do what i think is right
6821029 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6821030 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6821031 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6821032 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6821033 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6821034 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6821035 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6821036 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6821037 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6821038 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6821039 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6821040 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6821041 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6821042 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6821043 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6821044 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6821045 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6821046 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6821047 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6821048 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6821049 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6821050 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6821051 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6821052 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6821053 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a political statement to where he stood
6821054 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6821055 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6821056 law professors especially those from a place like the university of chicago are viewed with a jaundiced eye
6821057 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6821058 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6821059 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6821060 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6821061 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6821062 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6821063 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6821064 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has
6821065 his blend of off the charts athleticism and long range shooting ability is rare especially for someone his age we believe his best basketball is still to come
6821066 honor is more than a code it is a way of life
6821067 i agree with chets old position the one he had before he
6821068 2007 bedeutete es einen wendepunkt in sachen meisterschaft auch wenn es dann doch nicht ganz gereicht hat nun sieht es viel besser aus und ich freue mich definitiv denn vergangenes jahr waren wir ja richtig gut unterwegs
6821069 wir werden alles daf r tun um vor dixon ins ziel zu kommen
6821070 hoffentlich sogar richtig weit vor ihm das versuchen wir bereits die ganze saison aber es schaut gut aus denn in sonoma f hle ich mich wohl
6821071 this whole thing is a complete farce the whole thing is a waste of money because there is nothing to answer i have done nothing wrong
6821072 darius has been in twice for workouts with us and has impressed us with his progress health and attitude

6821074 theres something funny about someone trying to write a sequel to whats arguably the greatest play ever written in the english language
6821075 you are going to be seeing a lot more of that sort of thing in the film although that actually did happen
6821076 obviously its symbolic it works on both levels i dont want to tell you too much dont want to spoil the film but ill just say icarus ok if you know what i mean great if you dont it doesnt matter but you should probably read more
6821077 tristram shandy is an odd unusual weird unique piece of literature that we tried to do justice to and michael filmed it because people kept saying the book was unfilmable
6821078 so that to him made it a really good idea to make a film of
6821079 theres just something funny about someone trying to write a sequel to whats arguably the greatest play ever written in the english language
6821080 hamlet 2 doesnt everyone die at the end of the first one
6821081 culturally in terms of pop culture the british are much more conversant with american culture than americans are with british culture
6821082 so i think we tend to understand americans better than american understand us
6821083 birth of america was very well received by critics and strategy fans alike the sequel to this fantastic gaming system comes loaded with new features and expanded possibilities making birth of america 2 wars in america a must have for american revolutionary war buffs and turn based grand strategy fans alike

6821102 one cannot run a hospital with doctors and one cannot run one without them
6821103 if the ufc wants me to fight lesnar ill do it for sure lesnar was impressive against heath herring at ufc 87 he showed confidence in his standup striking and completely dominated heath herring i try to never underestimate any of my opponents but theres really nothing that worries me too much with brock lesnar i know it could be a tough fight but you know i train hard and i will be ready for this one too i am hungry
6821104 dont push me ill pull you instead and if you push too hard ill pull away

6821106 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6821107 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6821108 we will definitely try our utmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country
6821109 if they want to do something in haste they have all the right to do that we cannot force them to be with us but we are trying to reach a consensus
6821110 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6821111 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6821112 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6821113 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6821114 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6821115 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6821116 i think i ate too much gum and the gum has a lot of sugar
6821117 i keep telling my daughter not to eat a lot of gum and im not a good example i think my daughter today will be all over me at the house i accept it
6821118 by the next ge general election 5 years will have passed cyber years are like dog years one year in cyberspace equals to 7 years in real life
6821119 thats the pace at which things change so 5 years times 7 means 35 years in the real world
6821120 there you are simple as that ive just made our first non political video
6821121 some things are obviously alright factual footage documentaries recordings of live events but i think some things should still be off limits for instance if you made a political commercial so that its purely made up material partisan stuff footage distorted to create a slanted impression
6821122 the overall thrust of all these changes is to liberalise our society to widen space for expression and participation we encourage more citizens to engage in debate to participate in building our shared future
6821123 we will progressively open up our system even more if you compare today with 5 years ago 10 years ago its much more open today
6821124 if we find a deposit of perchlorate one can speculate that water had melted at some point and had collected it into an accumulation
6821125 we also heated the sample differently the oxygen bearing compound presumably perchlorate might have been there but we might have destroyed it when we were looking for organic compounds
6821126 were not going to be looking for the organic compounds were going to use the same heating plan that we did on the first sample
6821127 in addition to looking for oxygen were going to look for chlorine
6821128 weve really got to sit down and think about what are our last two
6821129 we have received thousands of e mails and many phone calls from people who say they are extremely upset
6821130 dude its a dog you can get another one relax
6821131 without question the situation was not handled well by officer stephens
6821132 this is a sad situation for all concerned but it does not warrant death threats

6821137 i just bought uefa euro 2008 im from northern ireland and was shocked at some of the discoveries in your game first of all northern irelands national anthem is not danny boy now for the worst part when i was playing with ni and finished match at the end of match screen it started playing the soldiers song which is the republic of irelands national anthem
6821138 just to let you know northern ireland is still british and not all ireland the national anthem is god save the queen where do u sic get your information on football from because whoever it is has never been to a northern ireland match god save the queen is always played as our national anthem as for the soldier song being played at end of match menu i was left disgusted so northern ireland has no identity now i suppose

6821147 when you consider that it doesnt include another four years of secondary education plus five more years of medical school if he wants to follow his previously stated goal to grow up to be a doctor like his daddy this will come as an interminably deep chasm of drudgery and imprisonment to connor
6821148 its difficult to know the effect on his psychological well being when he grasps the full truth that his education will be followed by approximately four decades of work bills and taxes during which he will also rear his own children to face the same fate all of which will of course be followed by a brief almost inconsequential retirement and his inevitable death
6821149 even a 50 year old adult would have trouble processing such a monstrous notion
6821150 he is primarily motivated by his uniquely harsh sense of personal honor loyalty to his friends to the point of destruction and enduring flames of spite

6821159 it sends a signal of resistance or i dont like what you just said it also by the way cuts your retention down to about 38 percent
6821160 how much youre retaining of what youve heard in the meeting so you really need to be aware that your body and mind or brain are not on separate planets that what you do with your body affects your brain but it also right or wrong it sends a signal to the rest of the people in your group
6821161 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6821162 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
6821163 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
6821164 i think the scheme has to fit the players i think it will be a very functioning offense i feel good at two premier positions at tailback and at quarterback
6821165 we think theres more parity in college because of the spread
6821166 you make more plays by space and you can get by with a lesser lineman its easier to find skill guys than linemen people used to be able to line up and hammer its hard to do that now
6821167 were going to be very inexperienced in the offensive line
6821168 we only had eight scholarship players at that position in the spring everything starts with them i feel like at the receiver position as well we have to have guys who can catch the ball more consistently
6821169 the quarterback as a runner outnumbers the defense and provides a clear advantage i learned that first hand at texas in 2005
6821170 we would run what we run whether any one of them was in there
6821171 jerrod has never really taken snaps under center so his drop points and being consistent in the pocket are something he worked on over the summer hes a big kid athletic and a better person than he is a player

6821178 old navy retains a strong place in the hearts and minds of customers and im confident that with tom as president more shoppers will rediscover the fun and value thats unique to this brand
6821179 in the last six months tom unified the organization and brought renewed focus to our customer target while making the tough changes necessary to get the brand back on track he is the ideal business leader for old navy
6821180 tom and i are actively looking for a powerhouse merchant who can be the creative force behind our product strategy as we build upon the positive steps our teams have taken to improve the product well offer our customers this fall and holiday
6821181 all of us at old navy take seriously the opportunity and responsibility we have to exceed the expectations of our customers im excited about working with this incredible team ive gotten to know as we bring our customers back to old navy

6821188 i had no idea that was gonna happen doctor i wish someone told me 9 months ago that i had a baby growing inside me i had no idea
6821189 everyone is totally aware of the amount of goals weve conceded even if you take it into the back end of last season but we know what were capable of producing
6821190 you cant have a squad that has the ability to go to vicarage road and the valley and places like that and produce results and be weak defensively
6821191 were not weak defensively were strong maybe we seem to be psychologically weak at times but we will get on top of that
6821192 you would say there is now more ability in the team going forward and at times last season we maybe relied on maybe two wade elliott or blakey robbie blake to produce something
6821193 now theres a bit more flair throughout the team but you cant have that at a cost to your defensive structure
6821194 the goals that came on saturday were against the run of play before that we were completely in control of the game
6821195 goals change games they change the momentum of a game especially when youre in the mentality of shipping four at sheffield wednesday and then the goal goes against you again against ipswich
6821196 there is a chance of peoples heads going down but this is where we need to be stronger
6821197 weve worked extremely hard in training this week some of the hardest work weve done so far and i believe it will be very beneficial you can never be too fit or too organised
6821198 if youre willing to put the hours in on the training pitch your rewards will come
6821199 we need to stick together even if we have to go back to basics for a game or two get that positive result and go from there
6821200 footballs all about momentum and runs and that why when the first goal of a game goes in no matter how early if youre used to conceding or losing you can think here we go again
6821201 but it works on the opposite side you get that first clean sheet and first win and the next week if you score the first goal you step on from there or go in 0 0 at half time and dont believe youre going to concede a goal
6821202 we need to stop whats happening and build from there
6821203 hopefully ill stay on the pitch a lot longer this time
6821204 i let the ball bounce through and scott sinclair got across me and the letter of the law says i had to go off
6821205 it was the right decision and i got two games for it which carried over into this season
6821206 but if you put yourself in that position you leave yourself open to be punished
6821207 i will just keep training hard and when i get my chance ill prove myself
6821208 he sir alex said dont just do your training do your extra bits you do at united and dont be afraid to ask people at blackburn to do the extra bits because that will improve you
6821209 he also said to me youd better play well because ill be watching you so hell be keeping a close eye on me
6821210 but i want to prove to myself that i can challenge at this level so its a big season for me
6821211 i dont think theres any guarantee of playing every week

6821215 and discovered a hand rendered sign inside that i regret to report had a few errors i know today was supposed to be my day off from typo hunting but if i may be permitted to quote that most revered of android law enforcers inspector gadget always on duty i cant shut it off will we never be free from the shackles of apostrophic misunderstanding even in a place surrounded by natural beauty
6821216 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further so we had to let the other typo stand still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity

6821229 la diff rence entre les jo et un championnat du monde ou deurope cest quon a le temps de r fl chir entre les matches on peut appr cier une qualification mais pas trop il faut aussi rester concentr

6821233 mein gott emmy was willst du dein mann betr gt dich nicht er schl gt dich nicht er missbraucht nicht deine kinder
6821234 she knows when my stuff is ripening she knows her stuff about food and promoting local food
6821235 i think there is a real connection between a healthy community and keeping our money in the local economy by supporting local farmers
6821236 creating that long term relationship with the farmers is key
6821237 its very easy to work with the farmers here you just make the connection have a conversation about your needs and then put it into motion
6821238 i got the desire to get my hands back in the soil and get more in touch with the source of my food
6821239 people really appreciate the fresh alternatives they can get here
6821240 they feel like theyre getting healthy food and they feel good when they eat it they get pretty excited when they realize how fresh the food is that it was picked as recently as this morning
6821241 you have to be persistent and be willing to prove your stuff is better that what they are going to get from the distributor
6821242 you cant just show up one day and say i have a bunch of cauliflower restaurants plan their menus two weeks out
6821243 i throw the words local growers in as much as possible when communicating with the public
6821244 dine fresh dine local is a great opportunity for restaurateurs like stephanie to highlight the quality food they source from local growers
6821245 it also highlights how diners communities and the landscape can benefit when eateries partner with local growers
6821246 the disposition of noble dogs is to be gentle with people they know and the opposite with those they dont know how then can the dog be anything other than a lover of learning since it defines whats its own and whats alien
6821247 mom and dad say i should make my life an example of the principles i believe in but every time i do they tell me to stop it
6821248 when were talking about moral absolutes when were talking about morality it seems to me that what theyre emblematic of is the fact that
6821249 our legal history in this country was based on the view there were moral absolutes
6821250 the court can find no principled basis upon which to find that or even fully consider whether the new display is constitutionally impermissible

6821284 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
6821285 i want to express my support for the russian position in the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia we oppose attempts to tarnish russias position
6821286 we are ready to consider requests from the syrian side on buying more arms
6821287 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of powers
6821288 it is a mutual interest of russia of israel and of the pragmatic leaders and states in the region not to send long range missiles to syria

6821300 this was data that was being held in a secure form but was downloaded onto a memory stick by an external contractor
6821301 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
6821302 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco at a cost of millions of pounds to the uk taxpayer
6821303 this will destroy any grain of confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
6821304 jacqui smith cannot continue to abdicate responsibility for this shambles she must at a bare minimum explain how this failure could happen when she first knew about it and what she now intends to do about it why did she sit on this information until it was dragged out by the media when was she intending to tell the public
6821305 if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
6821306 frankly the keystone kops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government
6821307 this represents a gross breach of the privacy of each prisoner whose data is on the stick
6821308 if any of those whose details are on it can show that they came to harm because of their information being in the public domain they could sue the british government for misfeasance of office and for a breach of the data protection act both of which could carry damages
6821309 this shows privatisation of these things hasnt helped we didnt have all these losses of information before the security of data kept by the government needs to be urgently reviewed
6821310 personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information
6821311 this information could provide valuable information to those who may misuse it had the data on the memory stick been encrypted its loss would have posed no risk
6821312 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies that are meant to do research for you then you need to be absolutely certain that when you give such information away the company concerned have put into practice procedures that are just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed since the loss of the child benefit discs

6821314 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on set up this morning
6821315 we were able to go quicker on each run without changing too much and we took a very good baseline into the afternoon session
6821316 in p2 our adjustments were again spot on but the sheer volume of traffic meant it was difficult to immediately confirm our final set up changes nonetheless were in pretty good shape and im looking forward to tomorrow
6821317 i immediately found a good balance at the front end and slowly dialled in the rear during the first session but the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car
6821318 in the afternoon we made a number of changes which seemed to pay off for us by the end of the session the car was working well and the balance felt really good todays progress is very encouraging
6821319 there were really masses of amendments and suggestions absorbed at this meeting many of the delegations said the same thing in different words
6821320 i remain very optimistic we will continue to make progress toward this important goal
6821321 key nsg states have rightly insisted on restrictions and conditions on nuclear trade with india to reduce the risk that this will assist its nuclear bomb programme and hold india accountable to its political commitment not to resume testing
6821322 this sensitive issue will profoundly affect global nuclear nonproliferation efforts for decades to come
6821323 eighteen peacekeeping observer posts have been set up on the administrative border of georgia and south ossetia
6821324 by the end of the day they will be pulled out
6821325 we know that during the afternoon ahmed and a group of friends were on the top floor of the block of flats
6821326 they saw the group of six youths approach the estate on bikes at that point they decided to leave ahmed had become separated from his friends who went to the third floor
6821327 ahmed remained at the top and it seems that one or more of the group made their way up to ahmed and he has been so scared he has made his way out of the balcony to shin down the outside of the flat when he got to the seventh floor his progress was stopped by a grille he has cried out for help lost his grip and fallen to his death
6821328 there are no injuries consistent with that scenario and the information we have is that ahmed fell to his death trying to make his escape rather than being involved in a confrontation with this group
6821329 i think that they the group came here for a specific purpose i do not know what that was but certainly ahmed and his group were sufficiently put on guard to decide to leave
6821330 there are a number of vulnerable children around who are very frightened to be on the streets here
6821331 i cannot explain to you but he was a wonderful boy he was very quiet and friendly with everyone with the family friends and neighbours we just want anyone who witnessed it just let us know if we knew how it happened we could relax and we feel we could leave him in peace we just to want to stop it happening to another person
6821332 his loss is an enormous tragedy for his loving and devoted family he was a happy friendly and generous boy who stayed away from trouble and was a good student
6821333 on the day of his untimely death he was due to receive his gcse results he would have been delighted to discover that his hard work and dedication to his studies had rewarded him with passes in maths and science as well as other subjects
6821334 his 17th birthday would have been on september 1 and this was the day he was due to enrol on a mechanical engineering course at tower hamlets college it is particularly sad that his now lifeless body lies in a mortuary in the very same street where he was due to begin this new chapter in his life
6821335 i am eager to see this become way overblown and result in the downfall of an american senator
6821336 jerry brown would like be governor again hes an ardent democrat and lefty and i dont think theres any chance hed start an investigation against a powerful democrat like chuckie schumer

6821401 any muslim who married more than the approved number of wives at a time either by mistake or out of ignorance is instructed to choose but only four and ask for allahs forgiveness
6821402 sgt shawn eades cpl dustin wasden and sapper stephan stock exemplify these values and were willing to sacrifice their lives to clear the road ahead for the people of afghanistan
6821403 his dedication to his soldiers and this mission was second to none this was his third tour in afghanistan and his reputation for succeeding at any task no matter how difficult was well known
6821404 the engineer corps held a special place in his heart he said
6821405 he loved to fix things and help anyone complete their task his work made him happy and his enthusiasm was infectious to all those around him
6821406 his commitment to what was right and just inspired all those that had the privilege of knowing him he let his friends and family know his desire to serve in this mission may that be a comfort to all who mourn for him
6821407 as we prepare to carry our dear friends home let us remember the joy and zeal that these men poured into this mission
6821408 it is now our job to ensure that the work they have sacrificed for is brought to completion may each of us walk proudly on the bridge these men have sacrificed their lives to build
6821409 an engineer reconnaissance team is a tight knit unit and these men were no exception they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with technical knowledge they generously used in this mission to help the people of kandaha
6821410 the taliban are against things they are not for anything they are against human rights they are against education they are against health care they are against women they are just against human decency
6821411 if we leave the population of kandahar province in the hands of the taliban we just wont be performing our duty and our soldiers know that
6821412 but this is the most devastating part of my career right now
6821413 then people just started blowing past me and i couldnt handle it
6821414 all the coaches from all the countries just stopped and watched and went what just happened here
6821415 you had it youve always had it and today you didnt if i knew id be looking wherever it was i dont know

6821417 im not exhausted ive been getting enough sleep ive been eating well
6821418 i hate watching people apologize after bad performances but i know why now they do it because there was a lot of pressure on me that pressure amounts to expectations of people back home and i always talk about how great performances by canadian athletes can be inspiring and motivating
6821419 adam has never anything to apologize for in the world of canoe kayak thats for sure
6821420 hes a stand alone athlete and the best one of the best kayakers in the history of the sport
6821421 as a betting man i would bet on him to win

6821423 if there is a great idea that is born at the university of michigan that we want to turn into a good business often those venture capitalists on the coasts will come knocking
6821424 its a 5 of the total roughly 60 billion thats in the entire fund and the returns in private equity have been excellent 22 over five years 11 over ten and the hurdle rate is about 8 so to me this is an opportunity and i think the professionals have been well vetted

6821426 anytime there is a question of leadership whether its a company or in a particular political situation or a state or city obliviously it has some impact for me i feel we need to get through it as quickly as we can
6821427 among the independent voters who could really swing the election in michigan theyre disproportionately female disproportionately 46 to 65 and thats an indication that there may be some of this sense that hillary clinton supporters arent really sure what theyre going to do in the general election

6821450 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
6821451 theres a great incentive because theres that much attention focused on them and they become interested in looking better and in no time they just shed it
6821452 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests that the men will settle for anything he has put everyone down

6821481 hannity just hates obama so much hes not happy that i would say anything kind about him at all
6821482 for obama faith is not simply political garb something a focus group told him he ought to try instead religion to him is transforming lifelong and real
6821483 heres a democratic candidate whos saying i think faith ought to come into play in the public square in an age when we know what kind of underwear a presidential candidate wears and what his dogs name is we certainly ought to know what he believes in religiously especially if hes saying hes going to carry it into the oval office

6821496 for the republicans its going to get worse before it gets better
6821497 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
6821498 i think the republican party is in the midst of a wrenching but important transition from the reagan bush era into whatever comes next
6821499 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
6821500 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
6821501 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
6821502 the republican party is going to undergo a fairly extended fight for its new identity
6821503 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party
6821504 and the first six months of 2007 may turn out in retrospect to be the bottoming out point of the republican party as an institution the 2006 elections were a tremendous wake up call

6821532 only an a would put together a budget like this
6821533 you are or you arent hes a very straight shooter
6821534 theres nothing unbalanced about it it always makes sense it helps him get the job done
6821535 nobodys going to recruit him to be a zen master
6821536 johns performance over 20 years shows a man who people seek out to do business with because they know hes effective
6821537 he could mock you he could needle you he could belittle you he did it to me on a couple of occasions
6821538 he always said if the opportunity arises again i would love to try it again
6821539 but it wasnt like a dream he couldnt live without
6821540 he put the campaign on his back and climbed up a mountain alone
6821541 he appears to be something different than what he was
6821542 i dont think you get to be 70 years old and then fundamentally change
6821543 mccains gyrations have more to do with figuring out his own party than anything else hes had to sublimate for obvious reasons
6821544 theyre drinking the kool aid that somehow i have changed positions on the issues all i can say is that we all grow we all grow wiser and we all refine our positions
6821545 hes attracted like a moth to the flame to the hard things

6821575 jody scheckter is an iconic name in both motor racing and now in organic farming as his fearless driving provided a number of prestigious victories on track we anticipate his outstanding farming abilities will have a similar effect on this extension to the gullwing restaurants menu
6821576 i started laverstoke park farm as i wanted to produce the best tasting healthiest food without compromise for myself and my family it has taken twelve years but now i feel we are back on the podium as the farm is now winning top awards and accolades throughout the country
6821577 when mercedes benz world approached us about supplying the gullwing it gave me great pleasure to provide our produce as i have been enjoying driving mercedes benz cars for almost 30 years
6821578 more and more people are coming around to the benefits of eating organically its better for the planet better for us and better for the animals good husbandry and ethical practices are key to what jody is achieving at laverstoke park the pork from the farm is naturally tender and sweet which inspired me for the new dish i am presenting today i am pleased to be able to help spread this message as well as offering the fruits of jodys farm to the diners at the gullwing
6821579 we stole a march this year with the introduction of the worlds first fuel injected mx production bike with the rm z450 and it proved its pedigree straight from the crate for 2009 the winning formula remains with colour and graphic changes to both the 450 and 250 with continued commitment in the uk for our rm two stroke range too which we believe is still very important and valid for our market
6821580 using this small surplus now to provide heating aid is not only a necessary step for simple human needs it is a wise investment in our states economic future

6821605 school spending has been rising much faster than inflation for over fifty years historically weve done a great job getting state legislatures to direct enormous geysers of money into the government school system and in the past when people asked why our results were so lousy we just told them we needed more money but now that spending is over 10 000 per student theyre not swallowing that as much as they used to options
6821606 we definitely need to do more to shift the blame for educational failure to something thats outside of schools control
6821607 agreed but how can we do that in a way that continues to increase our budgets
6821608 well weve always said we cant be expected to teach kids if theyre poor or sick or have anything at all wrong with them right so lets tell them all social services should be brought into schools

6821750 estos planes de integraci n vial y energ tica surgieron dada la necesidad de conectar a determinadas zonas que se complementaban de forma ptima pero sus resultados han sido irregulares
6821751 los pa ses de am rica latina tienen un comercio mucho m s intenso con europa asia y estados unidos que con sus propios vecinos como el comercio intraregional es de menor importancia se hace dif cil justificar inversiones de infraestructura en determinados eslabones geogr ficos

6821779 a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review
6821780 the openid people have defined a standard that has to be the worst ive ever seen from a phishing point of view
6821781 think of what we unleash with openid its way easier for the evil site to scoop the skin of a users openid service because are you ready
6821782 marc also explains why na ve attempts to solve this such as using cookies identifying users by their ip address bookmark login and displaying personal icons do not work
6821783 how do i know i am looking at his web page or talking to his identity provider by calling them up on dns openid is as strong and as weak as dns in other words it is great for transactions that wont attract criminal attack and terrible for those that will
6821784 the whole openid structure hinges on the url routing to the correct machine on the internet in other words dns now do some research on scary
6821785 cross site scripting also known as xss works in situations in which attackers need to circumvent the browser security settings to get access to unauthorized data using the browser as a proxy
6821786 a phishing site can spoof the realm using an open redirect server or by exploiting an xss flaw on a trusted domain means that neither the user nor the op knows what site that the user is signing into
6821787 there is a feature to set a site to be able to accept your credentials without you having to enter your openid password and since your openid provider does not provide these details to the host they do
6821788 if were to stop phishing and spoofing and id theft we need severe crypto locked down secure id systems
6821789 the openid fanboys want openid to work on any old platform using only standard software and so therefore are doomed to live in the world of broken authentication
6821790 openid starts with the concept that anyone can identify themselves on the internet the same way websites do with a uri
6821791 i have looked into it a bit closer now and i just can say it sucks
6821792 is nobody of you guys concerned about the openid tracking capabilities who would wanna sign up with openid and let them know what websites you visit on a daily basis
6821793 the idp can spy on the users activity on the internet as it is a central clearing place for all of the users logins
6821794 a huge boon for anyone who wants to start tracking on the web if you want to steal from people or invade their privacy openid is for you
6821795 this is steve and ill back that up with xx if im wrong
6821796 this is steve by the authority of the state of california with all of the rights and responsibilities thereof
6821797 theres nothing stopping a fake mark cuban from creating a fake openid or worse a fake identity provider
6821798 once this system is widely used and spammers begin to register openids in huge numbers how will site owners prevent spammy registrations
6821799 i can log in to any openid friendly site just by typing in neilcauldwell
6821800 the process of selecting an openid provider will stump the average consumer
6821801 i could care less if six apart or technorati can be an openid provider i dont particularly have a lot of care or trust in them i want these sites to trust my provider which in this case is my own corporate authentication server i think that is getting lost with all these players
6821802 there have been a spate of announcements recently with a number of companies both large and small announcing that their products will support openid
6821803 if users sign up to a service that only supports openids from certain servers openid isnt even open
6821804 dave kearns talks about the patents that sxip identity has applied for which appear to cover openid he relates that dick hardt assured him that sxip identity will be issuing non assertion statements on openid soon of course i find it odd that a company would spend the time effort and money to pursue ip that they already dont intend to enforce the sxip patent applications so far made public include these
6821805 i think its a gross mis representation of the truth to say openid was based upon sxip
6821806 if you look around youll notice that the major online services all provide ways for third party sites to accept user credentials from their sites
6821807 the old openid site was quite explicit in this regard
6821808 even if we take the standard false assumption of web security that there are no man in the middle attacks possible then openid still requires consumers and providers to talk through ssl with strict verification of certificates
6821809 what about the back door can someone say our favorite government find out everything i have said or done on the web byt just making friends with an open id vendor seems a total scam to me part of the collecting data for more targeted ads at best and total loss of privacy at worst what am i missing

6821814 eighteen million democratic primary voters donated money volunteered their time and energy worked very hard and then not only supported senator clinton but voted for her and often recruited other supporters as well all the efforts of supporters of legitimate citizens were for nothing because this man lied and cheated his way into a fraudulent candidacy and cheated legitimately eligible natural born citizens from competing in a fair process and the supporters of their citizen choice for the nomination voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by senator obamas lies and obfuscations he clearly shows a conscience of guilt by his actions in using the forged birth certificate and the lies hes told to cover his loss of citizenship we believe he does know supported this belief by his actions in hiding his secret in that he failed to regain his citizenship and used documents to further his position as a natural born citizen we would also show he proclaims himself a constitutional scholar and lecturer but did not learn he had no eligibility to become president except by means of lying obfuscations and deceptions his very acts proves he knew he was no longer a natural born citizen we believe he knew he was defrauding the country or else why use the forged birth certificate of his half sister americans lost money goods and services donated in their support of a candidate who supposedly was a natural born citizen simply because the dnc officers and party leaders looked the other way and did not demand credentials to answer the questions and prove whether or not senator obama was a legitimately natural born citizen even in light of recent information that has surfaced on websites on the internet suggesting senator obama may not be eligible to become president and questioning his status of multiple citizenships and questionable loyalties if the dnc officers and or leaders had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship through an oath of allegiance at age eighteen 18 as prescribed by constitutional laws the injunctive relief must be granted because failing to do so this inaction defrauds everyone who voted in the democratic primary for a nominee that is a fair representation of the voters failure to grant injunctive relief would allow a corrupted fraudulent nomination process to continue it not only allows but promotes an overwhelming degree of disrespect and creates such a lack of confidence in voters of the primary process itself so that it would cement a prevailing belief that no potential candidate has to obey the laws of this country respect our election process follow the constitution or even suffer any consequence for lying and defrauding voters to get onto the ballot when they have no chance of serving if they fraudulently manage to get elected it is unfair to the country for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of their ability to serve if elected all judges are lawyers and held to a higher standard of practice than a regular lawyer it is this judicial standard that demands injunctive relief prayed for here this relief is predicated upon one of the most basic premises of practicing law which states no lawyer can allow themselves to be used in furthering a criminal enterprise and by that gauge alone failing to give injunctive relief to the 18 million supporters of the other candidate a true natural born citizen eligible to serve if elected this court must not allow itself to be used to further the criminal and fraudulent acts to continue and be rewarded by becoming the democratic nominee failure to give the injunctive relief prayed for will insure that a corrupted presidential election process will only guarantee a show of unfair preference of one group of people over another group by not demanding the same rules be applied to all groups equally and fairly especially in light of the fact that both candidates are each considered a minority

6821916 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6821917 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6821918 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6821919 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6821967 when i first caught the guys act i was really surprised at how tight and professional they were the unit of creativity they have going on has enormous potential
6821968 their personalities really shine through and the relationship between the actors is excellent the physical comedy is very funny and to be honest this is without doubt one of the best shows at this years festival
6821969 all in all the greyfriars twisted tales show is good old fashioned rumbustious theatre that incorporates everything that is great about the fringe festival

6821989 i dedicate this win to jose calderon who wasnt able to play but has played a big part in getting us here
6821990 we played against a very good team we had a chance to win this game some mistakes some stupid fouls and they scored points
6821991 it was very difficult at the end to catch them it happened how it happened
6821992 i can talk about coaching i will not speak about referees
6821993 of course linas kleiza didnt play the best game he can play better i am not a referee
6821994 we played well but we lost because we made small mistakes
6821995 we allowed them to have second shots in the last quarter they went into a zone and i struggled to make my shots
6821996 but this is basketball sometimes you win sometimes you lose
6821997 its tough to play against spain if you want to win against them you need to play extremely well and be in good form
6821998 now we must forget about this game and concentrate on our bronze medal game

6822023 friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble this story came to my mind when i was writing an email to cherry about the conversation emails i had with a friend before the dinner
6822024 that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
6822025 as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities
6822026 we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote
6822027 if you look around the south for example youll see that most if not practically all of the blacks elected to state house and senate seats have been elected from majority black districts
6822028 its really very unusual for a black candidate who runs at the statewide level in any jurisdiction at large to get nominated or elected
6822029 one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
6822030 those are clearly heights to which you would not have seen african americans move at the time of the i have a dream speech
6822031 they still cant get access to real capital secondly you need business to business sales to grow and the amount of discrimination in the business to business market is very high
6822032 the african american community has traditionally been involved in service type businesses that are not necessarily going to attract equity capital
6822033 whites have not only inherited wealth from their ancestors for a longer period of time they inherit an understanding of our financial system
6822034 the people who still call the shots are of one race
6822035 in fact my best caucasian friend often says ill handle this so we can all be equal now we should probably handle these things together
6822036 whites talk like well the playing field is even now but the playing field in terms of legacy is not
6822037 transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood
6822038 as long as the negros basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one
6822039 is declining very slowly and indeed increasing in some areas
6822040 as long as we live in racially and ethnically separated communities were never going to reach the dream
6822041 for most types of subprime home loans african american and latino borrowers are at greater risk of receiving higher rate loans than white borrowers
6822042 its tough to claim that there is no discrimination in the criminal justice system but a 6 to 1 ratio is far too great a variation to be attributable only to discrimination
6822043 to which stricter sentencing policies unquestionably contributed has freed thousands of law abiding inner city residents from the bondage of fear
6822044 i think martin would be very proud of the progress weve made in some areas like politics
6822045 in just over two months its become clear that people will buy cds and downloads if they get access to the kind of service we offer
6822046 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6822047 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6822048 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6822049 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6822050 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6822051 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6822052 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6822053 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6822054 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6822055 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6822056 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6822057 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6822058 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6822059 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6822060 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6822061 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6822062 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6822063 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6822064 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6822065 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6822066 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6822067 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6822068 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6822069 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6822070 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a political statement to where he stood
6822071 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6822072 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6822073 law professors especially those from a place like the university of chicago are viewed with a jaundiced eye
6822074 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6822075 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6822076 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6822077 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6822078 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6822079 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6822080 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6822081 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6822082 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has
6822083 it contained shocking pictures of a number of foreign women inmates in what you could describe as very compromising positions
6822084 we did not receive that phone or a report to that effect
6822085 the phones confiscated from the women in the dochas are kept in a plastic tool box in a governors office
6822086 one reason for not handing them over is an apparent problem in identifying the owner as the women live together in the various houses
6822087 hey evan i love this week when we get to see the entire years planning all come together now further away and i really like golf now out of earshot
6822088 theres no strategic decisions in this district about how to bring everything together
6822089 were causing our own problems by not thinking about things in a systemic way
6822090 for the young people who attend those schools its great
6822091 but could we have a situation where we didnt have to rob peter to pay paul
6822092 criteria to keep some kids out you leave the large comprehensive high schools with a serious lack of resources
6822093 innovation for the sake of innovation is not something im interested in
6822094 i certainly celebrate what paul did but its certainly not going to be good enough for me
6822095 new superintendents have the prerogative to bring whatever changes and best practices to the district they serve i did that im sure shes going to bring her own ideas to try to take the district to the next level and i wish her the very best
6822096 my job is to make sure we level this playing field so all children have equal resources
6822097 youd see many more teachers who are experienced going into more challenging schools
6822098 it is something that we would be willing to talk about
6822099 we may indeed have to go back and make deeper cuts
6822100 i think the big story here today is that there is for the first time an expression by foxwoods to reconsider their current site and they are actively exploring other sites that are not on the waterfront
6822101 we have shared with city and state officials the obstacles that resiting would entail
6822102 following those discussions we have agreed in principle to consider other alternative sites and ways that we can mutually overcome those obstacles we are committed to continuing those discussions while preserving our rights to the south columbus boulevard site
6822103 we anticipated that there would be two different meetings because the issues are different
6822104 a good first step towards achieving the goal of re siting both casinos
6822105 process is important and we dont want to go from one backroom deal to another
6822106 the people of philadelphia should be able to say whether they want casinos and where their preferred location should be not the casinos
6822107 its not time for celebration but its time to be optimistic
6822108 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
6822109 shes this little freshman and she scores two goals against us both of them off her head
6822110 it was such a proud moment to think about how far she has come and the impact south jersey girls soccer has had on the world
6822111 that was one of our own over there scoring the game winning goal to give the usa the gold medal
6822112 she worked on her own to get incredibly fit flexible and strong to become a complete player
6822113 lloyd is such an asset to the team that many times i come away thinking shes the best player on the pitch and thats not just for the usa but for everyone
6822114 we ran a camp at moorestown this summer and carli came out and she was great with the girls encouraging them signing autographs doing whatever she could to help out
6822115 i know these athletes usually get paid for things like that but she wouldnt take a dime

6822117 hold on my mom says i cant tell you that
6822118 v there is no way you havent taken a shower or a bath since you got back so think hard and use your memory and think about when the last time you took one was
6822119 my mom said i didnt take any so i didnt
6822120 my mom said i didnt take a bath or a shower since chicago so i didnt
6822121 but my mommy wants me to stay small and she is going to cry when she sees that i am wearing size 7s now
6822122 siff cinema like black and white spy movies the original
6822123 for the republicans its going to get worse before it gets better
6822124 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
6822125 i think the republican party is in the midst of a wrenching but important transition from the reagan bush era into whatever comes next
6822126 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
6822127 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
6822128 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
6822129 the republican party is going to undergo a fairly extended fight for its new identity
6822130 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party
6822131 and the first six months of 2007 may turn out in retrospect to be the bottoming out point of the republican party as an institution the 2006 elections were a tremendous wake up call
6822132 a broadly center right party that achieves the goals of the american people
6822133 the temptation to subject economic crimes to prolonged processes and the deliberation of committees not only delays justice but makes ultimate accountability less likely
6822134 if you have high economic growth and a high level of corruption then corruption causes political contradictions that leads to the kind of difficulties we had in kenya at the end of last year
6822135 mange kan tilbyde dig en ny stil hos os finder du din egen
6822136 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6822137 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6822138 i guess if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6822139 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6822140 a statewide search to find pennsylvanians who like john mccain have so many homes that they just cant keep track of the number

6822143 mom i saw darth vader and it wasnt a dream
6822144 he went into the pond hoping to be blessed when a crocodile attacked him and dragged him into the deep part of the pond
6822145 this is a very unusual incident normally the crocodiles are very friendly and do not harm people
6822146 could see what the home offers beyond the mls sheet and website photos
6822147 its an emerging trend for real estate primarily upper bracket homes
6822148 it gives you the ability to target prospective buyers and highlight the lifestyle the home represents
6822149 traditional methods such as open houses for realtors and the public arent enough anymore
6822150 it gave people a chance to see what it would feel like to live in this remarkable beautifully restored pro perty
6822151 advertising is tricky youre not always sure where a buyer comes from
6822152 hes always had that somewhere between independence and renegade streak
6822153 you dont have to have gray areas on your principles and values but you have to have some compromising postures in order to achieve a common goal

6822159 thats the most fun ive had since my last interrogation
6822160 i am a black criminal and i have performed deeds of an air pirate
6822161 he had to carry a different burden than most of us and he handled it beautifully
6822162 he didnt need any coping mechanism thats just built into him
6822163 hells bells we were having monday night at the movies tuesday night at the movies wednesday night at the movies featuring john mccain
6822164 we only had the facts half right but john said nobody knew the difference
6822165 as good as any preacher that ever stood at a pulpit
6822166 wasnt a turning point in me as to what type of person i am but it was a bit of a turning point in me appreciating the value of serving a cause greater than your self interest
6822167 that if you put your country first that everything will be ok
6822168 people dont remember how ugly the pow mia issue was
6822169 i heard people scream in his face holding him responsible for the deaths of pows
6822170 everyone knows about his temper his inability to get along with people
6822171 only an a would put together a budget like this
6822172 you are or you arent hes a very straight shooter
6822173 theres nothing unbalanced about it it always makes sense it helps him get the job done
6822174 nobodys going to recruit him to be a zen master
6822175 johns performance over 20 years shows a man who people seek out to do business with because they know hes effective
6822176 he could mock you he could needle you he could belittle you he did it to me on a couple of occasions
6822177 he always said if the opportunity arises again i would love to try it again
6822178 but it wasnt like a dream he couldnt live without
6822179 he put the campaign on his back and climbed up a mountain alone
6822180 he appears to be something different than what he was
6822181 i dont think you get to be 70 years old and then fundamentally change
6822182 mccains gyrations have more to do with figuring out his own party than anything else hes had to sublimate for obvious reasons
6822183 theyre drinking the kool aid that somehow i have changed positions on the issues all i can say is that we all grow we all grow wiser and we all refine our positions
6822184 hes attracted like a moth to the flame to the hard things
6822185 act might be getting a little tired for a man of my years
6822186 american popular culture admits few senior citizens to its ranks of celebrated nonconformists
6822187 we lack the glamorous carelessness of youth and risk becoming parodies of our younger selves
6822188 i hope it means ill still put the country first and my party second
6822189 i hope it means that ill still do what i think is right

6822206 we have the responsibility to take care of this planet
6822207 we must extend love to all creatures trees and beautiful things
6822208 the only guiding principle of sarkozys policy towards china appears to be not to displease beijing
6822209 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening
6822210 this type of violent attack on a defenceless young man is deplorable and must be discouraged
6822211 it says to these thugs that you can go out and bash someone to a pulp come to court and say youre sorry and well give you a bond
6822212 these guys are street smart our system is so slack that it doesnt have the guts to hand out a just sentence
6822213 ajang told me he does not want these people to go to jail
6822214 he has been hiding because people have been in contact with him
6822215 hes changed his phone number hes moved his address and changed schools
6822216 there is quite some concern in the community particularly young people about mobile phone premium services
6822217 at times the lack of proper disclosure of terms and conditions may mislead consumers in breach of the trade practices act
6822218 who have been confused or misled by certain marketing techniques
6822219 there is an industry scheme in place regulating the provision of mobile premium services
6822220 active steps are being taken to review this and the government encourages industry to continue this work
6822221 as anything else theyre kids and we have to be patient
6822222 they all have some intangibles they bring to the table our scouts did a very good job i think youre going to see some nice results in a few years
6822223 i just want to make sure that when i do make the jump that im fully ready to have an impact when i get here
6822224 obviously the flyers turned it around a lot this year and had a great year and have a lot of great young talent im really excited but i just want to make sure that when i do make that jump im ready to be a part of it and land with my feet flat on the ground
6822225 hes got a chance depending on how the summer goes of coming into camp with a legitimate chance to turn some heads at camp next year
6822226 hes still a kid but hes becoming a man hes a hockey player he can play both ends of the rink he knows the game hes competitive you saw him when he came up for a couple games last year he stepped right in and i dont think he looked out of place
6822227 it was time for him to move on to learn the pro game
6822228 hes another guy that has a lot of skill can skate good size hes got to take it to the next level and get acclimated to the next level
6822229 over the course of this summer and coming into camp next year he could be a pleasant surprise
6822230 we were happy to be able to get patrick where we did that said you always want to see how a player performs at the next level patrick was exposed to a much higher level of play in the ohl and he came through with a big season
6822231 we were happy to be able to get patrick where we did
6822232 that said you always want to see how a player performs at the next level patrick was exposed to a much higher level of play in the ohl and he came through with a big season
6822233 he has made some very encouraging strides and we have high hopes for him in the future we signed him to a contract early last season which im sure was a good boost for his confidence he could be a guy who challenges for a roster spot with the phantoms in the fall depending on how the summer progresses and he performs at training camp
6822234 just by looking at his numbers you can picture what type of player he is hes going to finish his checks all over the ice hes going to be an antagonistic guy to play against those guys are the new type of agitating guys that are playing he can get on guys he moves real well and hes hard to play against hes one of those guys you want on your bench and not on the other bench he knows what his role is and he likes doing it our guys are extremely excited about him you noticed him when hes on the ice
6822235 whats most impressive about kevin is his level of maturity on and off the ice
6822236 he handles himself extremely well and is a born leader hes the guy that everyone on his team looks up to even at age 18 he has that presence about him and hes just all business
6822237 hes a well rounded two way defenseman good head good stick got some offense to his game
6822238 lehtivuori isnt a big guy and hes not going to suddenly develop into a huge physical presence or anything
6822239 but we like what he brings to the table in the skill department he is very talented with the puck and brings that skating element that is becoming so important to develop for your defense
6822240 hes still growing and that will take some more time as he continues to get stronger though joonas will gain a better understanding of the things he does best he already has a good idea because hes a very smart player
6822241 he moves good competitive smart good stick there arent a lot of weaknesses in his game hes going to be a good player and hes getting better as time goes on
6822242 this was his first season in north america playing at the major junior level and we like what weve seen so far
6822243 its not easy to make that transition from the european rinks but he did a fine job he made some good strides and also handled that midseason trade very well that says a lot about his character
6822244 payments were made for corrupt ends by an intermediary of alstom prom ag located in baden
6822245 these sums were transferred by other companies of the alstom group to public servants or officials of various countries in cases determining the awarding of contracts
6822246 findings in the current investigation suggest that the case may be broadened
6822247 the group is cooperating fully with the judicial authorities in this matter
6822248 i believed every word he said i believed he was going through hell
6822249 my heart goes out to all the people who have been hurt to make all this up is extremely crushing for anyone who has gone through cancer theres no better script than to be dying of cancer and giving glory to god in a christian context its the highest form of fraud
6822250 i saw michael talk and sing and hes so very charismatic
6822251 i decided to donate the money because i thought it could benefit more people but what a con
6822252 i act for paul hogan you know of him i will need to obtain advice from you from time to time on issues concerning his affairs there will be no need for you to talk to him
6822253 were all just hoping he comes and pitches well he could be well hes going to have to be a key part for us to try and make that playoff run
6822254 if thats the case then we would have no chance
6822255 that was the law before the initiative and its nothing new i dont know why wed relax any law
6822256 were concerned during the democratic national convention that they are going to use the law to cite people or detain them

6822293 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
6822294 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
6822295 this is a rare opportunity to hear a man whose opinions on world affairs are keenly digested
6822296 the world section of the paper is one of the most widely read and there are few commentators able to get to the point of a conflict or issue like gwynne does
6822297 increasingly we are aware that the university operates not just within new zealand but on a global scale and by hosting top communicators such as gwynne dyer we are helping people tap into the international consciousness
6822298 he was quite unwell but hed had a gastro bug that past week
6822299 he took himself off to bed with his bucket and paddy aarons dad and i decided to take him to the doctor in the morning
6822300 i was about to get him up thursday morning and i heard him fall out of bed he was really distressed really photophobic and all over the place
6822301 when i got there they had already taken him for a ct scan
6822302 they had to knock him out in ed because he didnt want to be treated
6822303 all they could tell us at that point was he had some sort of massive infection attacking him
6822304 the thing that struck us is that its so prevalent in the community
6822305 apparently up to 30 per cent could be carriers but be healthy and not realise we were quite shocked
6822306 aarons also in a reasonably high risk group which i didnt realise it was something i had always associated with babies and toddlers
6822307 you hear its quick but you dont appreciate how quick we had no idea
6822308 people can say what they like about public health but it gets my vote
6822309 even if your child has had the menzb vaccine they can still get other strains of meningococcal if your child is unwell and you are in doubt please seek medical advice
6822310 a woman asked my three girls to fill in submission forms my 10 year old and 15 year old didnt sign anything because it wasnt a competition my 12 year old signed and filled in the form not knowing what and why she was filling it in she was advised what to write on the form
6822311 children cannot sign a permission slip from school so why can they sign a submission form that is key to the local government decision process on a multimillion dollar deal it doesnt make sense
6822312 council is aware that the events centre steering committee hand drafted submissions forms with a variety of messages of support these were unsigned these submissions were made available for people to sign council does not believe that committee members or clubs placed undue pressure on individuals to sign the documents
6822313 when i was two i got a dinky little keyboard but i started playing properly when i was about 13 and started getting into competitions like little taupo talent quests
6822314 he said just give it a go you have nothing to lose
6822315 i will do one on piano hopefully a grand and the other two on guitar
6822316 it stems a lot from my friends and my own experiences family situations and day to day experiences that other people can relate to
6822317 i rang her on thursday and she was really happy for me and is going to come watch the final
6822318 i love music so much it makes me happy and makes other people happy i dont think you should have a talent and not share it with others
6822319 i have to acknowledge the skill of the people here and st john who did their job very well i was very lucky but i was very lucky because of their skill
6822320 at the time you just get on and do what you have to do but when they took ken away it was like what did i do there and people were saying to me you just saved his life we didnt see it as saving his life we were just seeing it as doing our job
6822321 i hope to but will take medical advice on that
6822322 on brown watch here at chartwell we started doing meals and charging 5 a meal turned out i was doing most of the cooking
6822323 weve had a few disasters but the majority are good someone said why dont you go in for the cook off and thats how it started
6822324 its tradition now going to the games and representing new zealand with pride its a bit of an honour so we have to keep going
6822325 unfortunately weve lost a few since derek died in the explosion we are going over there for him it will be good if we can go over there with his memory and bring back some medals
6822326 that accident would not have happened had the police van not been there
6822327 hearing about the injuries the children suffered was really hard and ive got to live with that for the rest of my life
6822328 for me today the biggest thing was i got the familys forgiveness
6822329 canada continues to be a major producer for both domestic and international markets exporting significant quantities primarily to the u s and to a lesser extent japan australia and new zealand
6822330 my goal is to create a lifestyle brand something that theres no limit to that will go from belts and sunglasses to jewelry and clothes and fragrance and home
6822331 i think anything i do will always have vintage inspiration i mean thats what drives me its the music i love its the clothes i love its the accessories i love its the icons from that time period i love but i think that my number one goal is to bring a fantasy element to reality and make things affordable for people within any kind of budget
6822332 the majority of the follow up is already in the can though they will have to go back into the studio at some point to add a few more songs standard industry contracts tend to be for six albums so if they provide some kind of compilation after their next album they will be free agents and able to renegotiate their contract or head out on their own

6822336 saturday was the big one i stayed up till 3 30am because the all blacks were playing
6822337 it was a bit of a juggle though because valerie was throwing so we had to go back and forth
6822338 if i miss anything i make sure i catch up on the tvnz website
6822339 with something like a rugby test match in a country that has a different time zone people will turn to us particularly if its not on free to air tv
6822340 but with the olympics if theres something happening at 2am people are setting the alarm and turning on the tv because its free turning on the tv is quicker than logging on to the computer and why wouldnt you watch it
6822341 the olympics has been a reader favourite over the past couple of weeks particularly with those people checking out stuff during business hours on the boss broadband
6822342 theyve asked some really moronic questions they just seem to lack tact
6822343 it does grip the nation and we have done really well all week people have been downing tools at work to watch every now and again things like the triathlon
6822344 in the old days people used to just watch the coverage they didnt need to be told how significant or amazing it was
6822345 one thing i have found in past research which im seeing this olympics is a lot of the coverage is around how successful new zealand has been measured by how many medals weve won
6822346 in addition i have requested that the ministry of health consider enhanced monitoring in relation to service delivery within your dhb
6822347 we want to make sure there isnt any lingering reservation or doubt from them that we might be deliberately trying to produce surpluses by withholding services
6822348 were an organisation that spends about a billion dollars a year so our surplus needs to be seen in that context
6822349 we just could not find capacity anywhere be it public or private to get more surgical volume through
6822350 so it is definitely not a question of setting out to produce surpluses by sacrificing service
6822351 it basically isnt touching our in patient facilities at all which are in significant need of being refurbished or rebuilt
6822352 if we built the funds up in this organisation we would have been paying a capital charge to the government at that stage it was 11 per cent
6822353 we would have lost millions of dollars over time in trying to build up funds to later invest in redevelopment so the revenue bank was conceived as a way of that money being withheld from the dhb to be given back to us in bulk at a later stage
6822354 welcome back to the 90s we miss the 90s because we didnt seem to suck as much then

6822375 japanese scientists said friday they had derived stem cells from wisdom teeth opening another way to study deadly diseases without the ethical controversy of using embryos
6822376 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6822377 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6822378 he had a lot of interest from many big clubs but he always told me one to one his preference was to stay
6822379 i was convinced he wanted to do that and i know he made sacrifices
6822380 people have advisors and some clubs pay higher wages than we do we have to accept that
6822381 the story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me
6822382 we had reached an agreement with everton for the loan of tiago
6822383 all that was needed was the players agreement and that never came
6822384 we take it therefore that tiago will stay with us
6822385 the market remains closed to us regarding players coming in like we already said some time ago now

6822412 it is degrading and insulting for teachers to have to interview with a principal before accepting a position in that school
6822413 so today we were doing this thing and the teacher said this and i said that and then ashley raised her hand and were supposed to do that and the teacher said that ashley could do this and then we went to the library and courtney got a book and i looked at every book and then we had lunch and guess what i had for lunch chicken nuggets and then

6822419 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6822420 health care workers should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
6822421 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6822422 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6822423 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6822424 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6822425 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6822426 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
6822427 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
6822428 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6822429 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
6822430 for example an operating room nurse would assist in the performance of surgical procedures an employee whose task it is to clean the instruments used in a particular procedure would be considered to assist in the performance of the particular procedure

6822452 we actually hit a streak for a touchdown but i called him down at the 25 we kicked it and we missed it so georgia southern won by two
6822453 this is how we identify each other in the game

6822543 but having said that we dont want to force him to come back until he wants to come back that is not good for alex or for his teammates as of sept 1 were moving on
6822544 our theory regarding adapting is that players who are physically and mentally ready to play in the nhl very seldom have any problems to adapt
6822545 adapting to the north american culture and language is according to us one of the most used myths which often are used by agents and gms to justify taking very young europeans out of their junior programs in europe and putting them to major junior and the ahl
6822546 players like ovechkin kovalchuk malkin and others like selanne forsberg jagr lundqvist you can add hundreds of names became immediate nhl stars simply because they were ready and the only language they needed was hockey which is an universal language
6822547 dave king told me this story when he was coaching metallurg and he had malkin on his team
6822548 of course i paid attention to what was going on some people might say the criticism of me is unfair but i wouldnt i can see why some things would be said about me im coming from the western conference ive played fewer than 100 nhl games in my career it comes with the territory you have to accept that just because you are under the microscope here does not mean you are under more pressure i can understand both arguments all i can do is what got me here and make believers of those who dont

6822568 once i ordered a sirloin steak and a chocolate sundae but everything was so cunningly disguised on the table that i mistook the chocolate sauce for gravy and poured it over the sirloin steak
6822569 truthfully 50 percent of the water that they use in those municipalities is growing kentucky bluegrass thats not necessary
6822570 so they take it from us and kill this natural environment to create an artificial one to grow an imported grass from a humid environment in a high plains desert its completely illogical

6822573 following more than 10 years of silent tensions the conflict flared again the syrian government inside its borders attempted to divert the banyas river which is one of the jordan rivers tributaries this was followed by three israeli army and air force attacks on the site of the diversion these incidents regarding water issues led up to the outbreak of the six day war in june 1967 between israel against syria jordan and egypt during that war israel captured the golan heights and the site of the banyas headwaters which enabled israel to prevent the diversion of the banyas by the syrians israel also gained control of the west bank the jordan river as well as the northern bank of the yarmouk

6822576 water conflicts are invariably shaped by local factors but the sheer scale of these conflicts makes it impossible to dismiss them as isolated events what we are dealing with is a global crisis generated by decades of gross mismanagement of water resources
6822577 the facts behind the crisis tell their own story by 2025 more than two billion people are expected to live in countries that find it difficult or impossible to mobilize the water resources needed to meet the needs of agriculture industry and households
6822578 in the longer term southern sudans economic interests are likely to lie in the north the oil boom may last only 30 to 40 years in the not too distant future southern sudans real strategic value will be its water and agricultural resources neighboring egypt which has seen its own population double to 70 million in the last 20 years depends for water on sudan

6822594 i wouldnt have kids in the school if i didnt think it was safe i would close the school
6822595 i do think there are areas of that school that continue to be dangerous
6822596 you can go most anyplace and build a school on top of a superfund site
6822597 they can build a school anywhere they want really and thats the sad truth i think at schools very little has changed and thats unfortunate
6822598 the children would actually pick up these chemicals and handle them
6822599 so for example one of these things was phosphorous rocks phosphorous rocks were little pieces of chemical residue that would bubble up to the surface the children would pick up these phosphorous rocks and when you threw them at a hard surface they would explode like a firecracker

6822611 i hate watching people apologize after bad performances but i know why now they do it because there was a lot of pressure on me that pressure amounts to expectations of people back home and i always talk about how great performances by canadian athletes can be inspiring and motivating

6822630 we decided to attend maker faire last year because it seemed like a well rounded family event that would be all about creativity through the arts and sciences
6822631 my kids loved the faire and have continued to refer to it all year
6822632 they told all our family and friends about it too
6822633 i was so energized by the people and creations at maker faire
6822634 it was amazing to see such a display of ingenuity and resourcefulness from computer programming to crazy bikes to felt softies everyone was so friendly and eager to share their ideas openly too i really appreciated the emphasis on shared creativity instead of on mass consumerism

6822654 our findings suggest that among children from less acculturated families participation in this oral health program leads to not only more favorable beliefs about the health related preventing cavities and gum diseases and psychosocial beautiful smile and self confidence benefits of oral care behavior but also an increase in oral care behavior such as brushing flossing and dental checkups

6822657 ill talk to them theyre a pretty good group of guys theyre not a group of guys that i need to motivate a whole lot
6822658 we suggest that peoples willingness to take psychological enhancements will largely depend on beliefs about whether those enhancements will alter characteristics considered fundamental to self identity
6822659 together this research converges to highlight the importance of identity expression and preservation in governing the choices and lives of consumers
6822660 preferences for enhancement pharmaceuticals the reluctance to enhance fundamental traits
6822661 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
6822662 the research findings suggest that viewers donated because they felt an obligation to do so people expect self or social censure if they dont help when they feel empathy for a person or organization they care about
6822663 failing to help under these conditions often leads to shame which is a powerful negative emotion that is experienced when there is an inconsistency between a persons actual and desired self
6822664 paradoxically it is by helping others that we derive self benefits in the form of enhanced self esteem and social approval serving others connotes valued human traits including compassion cooperativeness and kindness
6822665 an empathy helping perspective on consumers responses to fundraising appeals
6822666 we suggest that public health campaigns will be more successful if they attend to how behaviors act as markers or signals of identity
6822667 decisions are not only based on risks and benefits but also the identity that a given choice communicates to others consequently shifting perceptions of the identity associated with a risky behavior can help make better health a reality
6822668 shifting signals to help health using identity signaling to reduce risky health behaviors
6822669 but were going to tell them the world were taking over forever forever
6822670 weve had great success this year so were not going to be ungrateful and complain

6822672 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
6822673 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
6822674 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
6822675 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
6822676 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
6822677 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
6822678 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
6822679 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
6822680 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
6822681 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues
6822682 this area of research and specifically this and other projects led by drs hupert and xiong shows how fields such as the engineering sciences can contribute to solving medical and public health problems
6822683 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again

6822699 the sympathy inherent to a close relationship with a victim extends to other victims leading benefactors to prefer charities that help those suffering from the misfortunes that have affected their friends and loved ones
6822700 so friendship with a victim does not simply make people more sympathetic rather it directs their sympathy to others with the same misfortune as their friend or loved one
6822701 if as our results show a relationship created in the lab in a few minutes can significantly increase giving then surely a charity can inspire a connection between a victim and a benefactor through its solicitations
6822702 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again

6822737 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6822738 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6822739 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6822740 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6822741 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6822742 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6822748 the bbc believes its plans to relocate the research and innovation department are in the best interests of the future media and technology team and in the best interests of the licence fee payer

6822757 the government is attempting to develop and modernise cambodia quickly but theyve lost sight of the people theyre trying to help

6822761 filling boeng kake lake will have untold environmental consequences as it is the primary natural reservoir where rainwater is collected during the monsoon season
6822762 it is hard to believe city hall officials that the lake filling will not lead to flooding and other negative environmental consequences
6822763 but i dont agree with private developers using the governments name to get their way

6822776 in the purest sense the judgment of the ioc is irrelevant
6822777 it is the athletes own measure of self that matters in my moment of truth i lost the bronze medal to karel lismont i reached down and found a well of fatigue i cant change that but at least i can claim my race what i did and didnt do as my own
6822778 if the ioc had ever pursued an inquiry about cierpinski i would have had to recuse myself
6822779 i have to give current ioc president jacques rogge credit
6822780 rogge has done as good a job as anyone on the planet could do a lot of progress has been made
6822781 the ioc should do something to acknowledge the fact that the east germans were cheating
6822782 i dont know if the ioc should make some sort of statement or have something in the record books
6822783 theres only one thing that would be wrong and that is to do nothing which is what the ioc has chosen
6822784 if i were his lawyer id give him the same advice

6822876 last year northrop threatened to pull out of the competition unless the military altered its initial bid request and the air force obliged it that time the air force blinked
6822877 the aerial tanker it proposed is no longer a good match because the air force is now emphasizing fuel capacity and it deserves six months more to challenge northrops larger plane
6822878 what we proposed 18 months ago would not fit the bill for what the air force is looking for our 767 200 doesnt fill the bill weve been looking at other configurations
6822879 needs six months to study and prepare its bid based on a different airplane

6822903 the scheherazade of the sales rack unveils how to unearth haute looks for less and gives advice on dressing well from choosing tailors to finding bras
6822904 to reach that level of determination is a matter of the will not of debate or of reasoning it is absolute and irrevocable surrender of the will an undue amount of thought and consideration for ourselves is what keeps us from making that decision although we cover it up with the pretense that it is others we are considering
6822905 but before we choose to follow gods will a crisis must develop in our lives this happens because we tend to be unresponsive to gods gentler nudges he brings us to the place where he asks us to be out upmost for his highest and we begin to debate he then produces a crisis where which we have to decide for or against that moment becomes a great crossroads in our lives if a crisis has come to you on any front surrender your will to jesus absolutely and irrevocably

6822932 misschien een goed idee een groep te vormen van zeg 500 personen onder wie veel jongeren met verschillende achtergronden en afkomstig uit alle delen van de wereld zij zullen op basis van hun individuele capaciteiten worden uitgenodigd deel uit te maken van de groep die creatief nadenkt over de vraag hoe te komen tot een gezamenlijk antwoord op de voornaamste terreinen van grote zorg zoals in 1948 in amsterdam op schrift gesteld maar dan geherformuleerd als relevant voor de wereld van vandaag
6822933 velen van hen zullen over wijsheid expertise en persoonlijke ervaring beschikken om zich direct bezig te houden met de bedoelde terreinen van grote zorg vele anderen zullen langdurig betrokken zijn en actief participeren in werken van gerechtigheid op lokale en nationale niveaus samen kunnen zij een ideaal ontwikkelen en delen van een wereld waarin gerechtigheid en vrede heersen zelfs wanneer zij een verschillende geloofsachtergrond hebben
6822934 ook binnen onze christelijke gereformeerde kerken roept de naam van arminius nog altijd afwerende reacties op en dat is heel begrijpelijk zijn naam staat immers voor een theologische visie die aan de vrije wil van de mens een beslissend aandeel in de toe eigening van het heil toekent een aandeel dat ten koste gaat van gods soevereine genade op 27 juni jl promoveerde ik aan de theologische universiteit te apeldoorn op de theologie van arminius de redactie van de wekker vroeg mij samen te vatten waarover mijn proefschrift gaat in enkele dagbladen en kerkelijke bladen heeft mijn proefschrift tot discussie en vragen geleid daarbij is soms ten onrechte de indruk gewekt dat het mijn bedoeling zou zijn arminius te rehabiliteren of ongereformeerde opvattingen positief voor te stellen tijdens mijn studie ontdekte ik dat er verbazingwekkend weinig onderzoek naar arminius theologie is gedaan veel boeken geven een onjuist beeld van arminius informatie die vervolgens door anderen wordt overgenomen zonder dat arminius zelf wordt gelezen iedereen heeft recht op een eerlijke behandeling opvattingen moeten daarom adequaat worden weergegeven en motieven worden achterhaald naar mijn mening was de belangrijke vraag naar arminius theologische motieven om af te wijken van de gereformeerde theologie in zijn dagen nog niet op een overtuigende manier beantwoord met mijn proefschrift heb ik arminius recht willen doen door op die vraag het antwoord te geven het is inderdaad zo dat daardoor een nieuw zicht op arminius ontstaat een beter begrip waardoor bestaande beelden gecorrigeerd of genuanceerd moeten worden dat is wat anders dan beweren dat we het in alles met arminius eens kunnen zijn ik kom daar in het derde artikel nog op terug ook zegt dit alles op zichzelf nog niets over de dordtse leerregels die zich in vijf artikelen tegen de remonstranten keren immers de remonstranten beroepen zich wel op arminius maar uit mijn en ander onderzoek is gebleken dat er duidelijk onderscheid moet worden gemaakt tussen arminius en de remonstranten een veroordeling van de remonstrantse dwalingen betekent dus niet automatisch een veroordeling van alle opvattingen van arminius

6822959 who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state
6822960 on the portico of the mccain estate in sedona or maybe in one of his six other houses
6822961 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
6822962 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6822963 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6822964 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6822965 if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america

6823204 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
6823205 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
6823206 the republican party is going to undergo a fairly extended fight for its new identity
6823207 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party

6823215 i t is doubtful that the amendment could even be thought to require that members of state militias be allowed to keep weapons in their homes since that would reduce the militias effectiveness
6823216 the ratifiers of the amendment probably did think that the right of militiamen to keep and bear arms entitled them to keep their weapons in their homes

6823418 in the past intermarriage was viewed as an act of rebellion a rejection of judaism jews who intermarried were essentially excommunicated but now intermarriage is often the result of living in an open society if our children end up marrying non jews we should not reject them we should continue to give our love and by that retain a measure of influence in their lives jewishly and otherwise life consists of constant growth and our adult children may yet reach a stage when judaism has new meaning for them however the marriage between a jew and non jew is not a celebration for the jewish community we therefore reach out to the couple with the hope that the non jewish partner will move closer to judaism and ultimately choose to convert since we know that over 70 percent of children of intermarried couples are not being raised as jews we want to encourage the jewish partner to maintain his her jewish identity and raise their children as jews

6823520 im excited happy and looking forward to whats coming up i was really looking forward to playing in the premier league and i knew this is one of the clubs with a lot of ambition in the league
6823521 i had a good feeling with everybody i was talking to inside the club when you feel that there are dynamic people and who have knowledge about football you know you are in a good environment to improve

6823527 at a press conference which he himself organized demis nikolaidis announced his decision to resign from his role as president of aek
6823528 the truth is that this press conference was called under extraordinary circumstances after the publication of a particular newspaper yesterday i want to say things as they are and as they will simply remain
6823529 in 2004 we took over the administration of this clubt at that point i asked the shareholders to give me five years to start the work with the club whatever happened as you well know when this season finishes in may those five years finish
6823530 since the beginning of the summer we have been discussing amongst ourselves what we are going to do when after the end of those five years indeed i made it clear to my remaining shareholders that i did not want to continue in my role after may and to wait until then to see what we were going to do some will stay on they will continue i made those intentions very clear
6823531 we remember the objectives we had set out because i had written them down with a fountain pen whilst i was in spain at the time one was to stabilize the club financially which is something we managed to do
6823532 i have believed since the start of the summer that by the end of this season we will have resolved all of the issues surrounding the stadium i believed and still believe that by the end of this season the issue of the stadium will be resolved and that the founding stone will fall and that the signatures will be completed there has been extremely good cooperation with the government so far so i believe we will have finished by may those are the issues i wanted to finish with as president and i felt obliged to tell you now that i would not be continuing beyond may
6823533 i dont think that during these four years ive done aek wrong
6823534 but this club has good honest shareholders who are interested in football the training centre would never have been possible without them especially mr nikos notias
6823535 they decided that for the good of the club money needed to be spent on facilities first rather than players because at the moment that is what is most important

6823544 one of my friends who lives in ankeny went out and decided to buy me an old bus
6823545 a typical weekend is leaving work at noon on a friday and getting to iowa by the evening
6823546 in three years i have only missed two games and both of those times i attended friends weddings its never a lonely drive i usually take someone along for the ride so far everyone i have taken to the tailgate has come back with excitement and enjoyed it completely there was even a guy that i brought along for a game one time and now he is getting tickets for him and his family
6823547 i was never a big cyclone fan until i went to school there the year 1989 would have been my first game a football game against ohio when i was in school i worked at a golf course on game days i would go into work but we didnt do any work other than get ready for the game his bus and his tailgating is what inspired me to do what i do today for football games
6823548 most definitely my favorite game would have been the insight com bowl in 2000 that was the year we beat pittsburgh in phoenix ariz
6823549 we road tripped all the way down to phoenix where one of my college buddies had family down there
6823550 any of the times we beat the hawks in iowa city i can be happy for an entire year
6823551 another great road game was in kansas city for the eddie robinson classic 2002 that was senecas game and he played so well against florida state that was really a game that we werent supposed to have any chance in and aside from everyones views on the call at the end it was just great to even be in contention against that formidable of an opponent
6823552 johnny orr just seemed like the kind of guy that anyone could talk to i met him down in shreveport la and it was like he and i knew each other for years
6823553 fred hoiberg was playing when i was just leaving school he seemed like such a class act hard working hard nose and an all around good person
6823554 seneca wallace was electrifying and made things exciting to watch regardless of the score one of the most exciting players iowa state has had and can really draw you into football games
6823555 troy davis has to be up there on my list as well i just cherish iowa state so much and any player that brings that kind of positive notoriety to this school should be commended for what they did
6823556 my plan is to not miss any of the home football games from here on out

6823679 our aspiration is to always see each other as individuals first and though we may not always succeed at that our underlying fairness and decency means that one day soon we will this marks tremendous progress for our community and for the voting public
6823680 i think this sends a signal to young gays and lesbians across the country that they can consider a career in public service and they shouldnt be scared away from that merely because of their sexual orientation
6823681 gay americans are woefully underrepresented in our government jareds victory brings us one step closer to fulfilling americas promise of a truly representative government

6823689 the attempt by cegir to build this toxic dump was in total violation of the human rights of oodham indigenous communities
6823690 if this dump had been built it would have been in violation of the integral oodham right to protect their traditional homelands and their continued responsibility to conduct their traditional way of life through ceremonies that have been held at quitovac since time immemorial
6823691 the oodham creation story says that at quitovac the cultural hero iitoi killed a monster that threatened to destroy the people

6823737 there is no longer a case for taking 4 billion a year from the public to produce programmes they do not want or can obtain free elsewhere
6823738 the world has moved on since the days when the bbc was central to british life any modern government that fails to acknowledge this fact is quite simply defying the will of the people
6823739 corporate gigantism and belief in a unique moral mission have made the bbc what it is today and yet both are of vanishingly small concern to viewers and listeners
6823740 the bbc internally is not neutral about multiculturalism it believes in it and promotes diversity lets face up to that
6823741 it must seek respect not for what it is but for what it does
6823742 the bbcs remit is to produce a volume of high quality programmes with much reduced output its long tradition of producing fine programmes and a budget of 4 million a day it should be able to achieve it triumphantly
6823743 the english democrats are offering a fresh start and reject the clich ridden and spin politics of the past we offer the politics of a common national identity and common values our politics are riddled with spin and political correctness a vote for the english democrats is a vote for honest and plain speaking
6823744 there should be an immediate referendum on the eu lisbon treaty it is wholly wrong for labour to try to impose this treaty on us contrary to their own specific manifesto commitment that there should be a referendum the people of the republic of ireland have said no we want our say
6823745 there should be free residential car for the elderly as is available in scotland it is wrong that pensioners homes in england are being seized to pay for this
6823746 we also demand access to all nhs drugs not a
6823747 there should be an end to the unjustified subsidies to other parts of the uk we want a fair system for all
6823748 england can no longer sustain uncontrolled mass immigration it should be stopped it places an unacceptable strain on all our services all previous governments have allowed this situation to get out of control
6823749 the government should seek to protect society and not the criminals
6823750 there should be an english parliament with an english prime minister and government with at least the same powers as the scottish ones
6823751 the voters of haltemprice and howden have the chance to send a clear message to the government and the rest of the stale political establishment that the people of england are no longer prepared to be treated as second class citizens within the uk let us put englands interests first
6823752 i am convinced that standing still is not an option the present arrangements are producing growing resentment all over the united kingdom particularly in england
6823753 a vote for joanne and the english democrats is a positive vote for the people of haltemprice and howden it is a vote for england and for an english parliament first minister and government for england
6823754 i will impress upon them the need to avoid prejudicing the process which we must now undertake in ireland
6823755 accord us the time we need to play our part in understanding last weeks vote
6823756 one of the main goals will be to calm the europeans down and not inflame the situation either in the eu or back at home any further
6823757 it will be made clear to the eu partners that it is politically impossible for ireland to have a rerun
6823758 i think you have excellently designed institutions for the budget process in an independent state or a state with substantial fiscal autonomy
6823759 barnett is unsustainable in the long run it is neither efficient nor equitable
6823760 it gives perverse incentives to the devolved administrations their block grant is a function of a number they cannot control
6823761 in turn their decisions have consequences which the uk government cannot fully control
6823762 it probably derives not from greater need but from the more credible threat to the union of the united kingdom that they pose
6823763 prof mcleans evidence points to one of devolutions fundamental flaws that we are spending money without direct responsibility for raising it
6823764 it is time to look again at how we fund our policy priorities
6823765 we may have to say well look were not happy with this situation here are some of the powers wed like to have back but we cant give you that referendum on the lisbon treaty because its already been put in place across the rest of europe
6823766 mutterings about regime change used to be confined to the fringes of the party but now there is a more widespread view that gordon will have to go unless he can win back public support
6823767 tamsin delivers for crewe and nantwich you told tamsin your concerns she put them directly to the chancellor she stood up for you
6823768 i think you will find he is not the type of lawyer he claims to be

6823770 carter tells anyone who will listen that james is the best thing since sliced bread
6823771 one way of unseating him would be through a war of attrition with relentless carefully placed attacks laying the ground for a delegation of elder statesmen the men in suits
6823772 asked what he would be in another life it would be a salesman car dealer pr guy estate agent and worst of all a foxtons estate agent
6823773 government in the uk is now so large diverse and complex that it is impossible for anyone to manage effectively let alone by ministers with no prior experience of management and little in depth understanding of the work carried out by their departments government today tries to do too much and consequently fails the structure of government needs to change if we hope to see better value and significant improvements in our public services
6823774 do you think that regeneration is adding a new wing to your mansion
6823775 have you and your tory mates on the council been soft on yobs and failed to make our streets safer
6823776 flatters some of the most chauvinistic and backward looking parts of british society
6823777 is a small price to pay for saving the union
6823778 we are worried about the reports of ken drinking too much if we lost london it would be a political disaster and gordon knows that
6823779 in my view ken livingstone would do a better job if he drank less i fear we have an alcohol fuelled mayoralty
6823780 well im concerned about the amount im drinking because its nothing like enough
6823781 the english are awakening to the unfairness of the barnett formula and to the democratic deficit in the way in which we are governed
6823782 come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue if england to itself do rest but true
6823783 look if england got its own parliament and the union broke up what would happen to all the scottish people living in england and all the english people living in scotland
6823784 the truth the whole truth and anything but the truth
6823785 in some of the more heavily populated urban areas of the country family life is quite frankly in meltdown or completely unrecognisable
6823786 in some areas of the country even including the more urban parts of the sleepy west in which i operate family life in the old sense no longer exists
6823787 so i suggest the general collapse of ordinary family life because of the breakdown of families in this country is on a scale depth and breadth which few of us could have imagined even a decade ago
6823788 what is certain is that almost all of societys social ills can be traced directly to the collapse of the family life
6823789 most children and young people in england today are safe healthy and achieve well
6823790 the new brownvilles will be the same old projects that developers have been trying to squeeze through planning for ages greenwashed to suit the zeitgeist commuter dormitories with low energy knobs on
6823791 immigration is responsible for at least 70 per cent of the uks projected population increase which will take the uk from 61 million today to 85 million by 2081
6823792 the environmental consequences of such a massive population rise are alarming they include loss of countryside and green space and all the psychological stresses that come with high population densities overcrowding and loss of tranquillity
6823793 the alternative vote has many attractions including the fact that you have to get 50 plus one in that constituency therefore you have a greater legitimacy
6823794 it should not be about parties choosing a system that will most advantage themselves its about a voting system that delivers democracy for all of us
6823795 i dont understand how it can cause offence it is our country after all
6823796 home office policy precludes applications with tattoos on lower arm hand face or neck that are prominent which may cause offence and or invite provocation from the public or colleagues
6823797 a family who arent of english origin who see england on your arm could feel you might discriminate against them
6823798 we live in a diverse society and try to ensure we give everybody equality
6823799 but im now looking at other options like the fire service or prison service
6823800 this tattoo was clearly visible as it does not meet our rigorous standards his application was rejected
6823801 i expect they will want to ensure that the same type of collateral for central bank loans is taken here as it is by the fed and european central bank
6823802 i think the issue here is much more about ensuring that as peaks and troughs hit central banks are prepared to act and provide liquidity if liquidity is required
6823803 the bank of england is very keen to ensure that we have good strong confidence in our market after all weve got good strong banks
6823804 make it clearer what it means to be a citizen
6823805 practical measures that may help enhance a sense of shared belonging
6823806 my report makes a range of proposals that touch every stage of an individuals life my proposals are intended to promote the meaning and significance of citizenship within modern britain
6823807 in terms of a british national day what may be beneficial is a new public holiday to celebration the bond of shared citizenship
6823808 it can be a pledge of commitment to the country it can be a statement of what the rights and responsibilities of citizens are
6823809 we already teach schoolchildren what citizenship means but it would make sense to have a coming of age ceremony which marks the moment they move from being a student of citizenship to being a real citizen in themselves
6823810 a half baked idea that should be left to go mouldy
6823811 i see this as an empty gesture to ask 16 year olds to troop into a hall and like americans put their hands on their heart and take an oath of allegiance is risible
6823812 we dont support it and neither do the vast majority of parents teachers and children in scotland
6823813 there is corruption in any government there is always corruption its bad when it is more than 15 per cent

6823832 hab an prometido que antes de tomar cualquier medida se iba a convocar a una audiencia p blica y nos encontramos con el decreto de scioli cuando nos comunicamos con el subgerente de concesiones viales no nos quiso atender

6823837 que el gobernador tenga valor y exija al estado nacional que destine parte de los 12 000 millones de pesos anuales que se recaudan con estos impuestos s lo se trata de reasignar los fondos que uno paga
6823838 debido a la baja densidad de tr nsito se recauda poco y eso se lo destina al mantenimiento de las cabinas
6823839 se habla de rescindir los contratos e indemnizar a los concesionarios el aumento viene a compensar ese pago con la plata de los usuarios

6823859 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6823860 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6823861 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

6823867 this subdivision introduces sprawl to the gaviota coast extending suburban residential development well beyond the urban growth boundaries onto prime agricultural lands the project conflicts with a number of county policies designed to protect the gaviota coast by introducing visual blight onto scenic gaviota coast lands and allowing development on biologically and culturally sensitive lands the viability of agriculture and the health of the regions ecology are unnecessarily compromised by this project
6823868 all of these issues could have been addressed if the planning commission had created a viable transfer of development rights program tdr
6823869 the applicant has manipulated the project and process to avoid proper conditioning and consideration of alternatives using the adjoining ranchs conditions on participation as a shield to eliminate conditions and alternatives they did not favor
6823870 as recommended by the planning commission this project represents a huge loss for the people of santa barbara county
6823871 the planning commissions support for a subdivision on the gaviota coast is a call to action throughout santa barbara county
6823872 rachel took on a case that would cause a much more senior attorney to pause and achieved a stellar result that exemplifies the best of the legal profession and our firms commitment to the community
6823873 rachel was driven by her passion to provide a voice to those seldom heard performing exceptional legal work for which we are extremely proud
6823874 i believed strongly in dianas rights to justice i had little experience with immigration law but was constantly encouraged by my clients unfaltering optimism
6823875 its just a single case in one persons life but meaningful change often happens in small measures
6823876 gt bloodbath amp beyond hey hernandez i gotta tell ya arsas new album is freakin
6823877 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6823878 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6823879 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6823880 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6823881 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6823882 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6823885 no quiero usar la palabra arrepentimiento y no quiero menospreciar al villa pero s que en el fondo de mi coraz n pienso que este fichaje no fue el acertado no era el equipo para el que quer a jugar
6823886 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6823887 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6823888 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6823889 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6823890 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6823891 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6823892 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6823893 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6823894 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6823895 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6823896 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6823897 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6823898 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6823899 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6823900 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6823901 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6823902 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6823903 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6823904 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6823905 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6823906 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6823907 my security system made me remove all java from my pc
6823908 java like any technology on your computer can be used safely and to great effect
6823909 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6823910 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6823911 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6823912 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6823913 had to climb on my mothers roof once it was so fun i actually saw a naked neighbor girl
6823914 insert uninteresting one line description of the event in question
6823915 the synth is actually looking to present your photos in relation to each one and to do that its finding the key data points in each photograph and then trying to map them into additional photographs
6823916 so to have a good synth you need to have pictures that overlap so you can then use the synther to construct that virtual world
6823917 youll be able to ask queries of that image what is that place where is that place how good is the food there
6823918 i think friends are going to be using this when they go to gigs and events and festivals taking photos from different angles and perspectives and then montage those together to create a wonderful 3d browseable panorama
6823919 if microsoft are really clever theyll then integrate photosynth with virtual earth they can ask people to take photos of their community of their towns and cities and then send in the photos
6823920 then microsoft have got those raw resources that they can use to turn into 3d cities
6823921 compiling that with seadragon technology allows you to quickly receive your information over the web so you can view those photos not just quickly but in a 3d setting in relation to each other
6823922 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6823923 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6823924 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6823925 a high proportion of those children are home schooled in illinois pretty much all of the new cases of measles were among home schooled children and none of them were vaccinated
6823926 the measles german measles and mumps vaccine or mmr as we call it has been given in literally billions of doses worldwide with extraordinary safety
6823927 before the measles vaccine in this country there were 400 deaths of u s children each year caused by measles
6823928 measles carries serious complications including pneumonia and encephalitis which is a life threatening inflammation of the brain tissue that can be caused by viral infections such as measles measles is a serious illness to be cavalier and not vaccinate shocks someone like me who has seen the devastating effects of this disease
6823929 playing into an age old trick of stereotyping strong women as insane
6823930 embracing the same she devil stereotypes they once claimed to resent
6823931 obama is not disproportionately weaker among clinton supporters who comprised her core groups such as women seniors and working class whites
6823932 instead hes losing those who value strength and experience over change who doubt obamas qualifications and who see him as a risky choice mirroring his challenges among all adults more broadly
6823933 huge numbers of clinton supporters are determined to sink the election
6823934 the preliminary investigation shows no speeding involved on the part of either driver
6823935 no charges have been filed at this time were waiting on test results to come back
6823936 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6823937 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6823938 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6823939 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6823940 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6823941 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6823942 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6823943 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6823944 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6823945 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6823946 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6823947 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6823948 after thoroughly reviewing the gpo market leaders the best decision for central dupage hospital is to stay with premier we were impressed with premiers intimate knowledge of our needs premiers value proposition is specific detailed and targeted to our unique supply chain needs
6823949 central dupage hospital definitely shares our vision for reducing healthcare costs through a comprehensive approach to managing the supply chain through aggressive contracting strong field force support and innovative spend management decision support tools their renewal of their partnership with premier is a vote of confidence for how fully we are committed to helping them reduce costs safely and improve the efficiency of their supply chain
6823950 overall premier had the best market basket results premier tools especially spendadvisor spend analytics were the best and most cost effective most important they know us and our needs we wanted to know how we would get at cost savings and premier quite frankly was more detailed premier values are definitely aligned to meet our needs
6823951 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6823952 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6823953 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6823954 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6823955 merging the very different user experience of the internet with that of the tv is no small task
6823956 making that experience an easy to use entertaining and memorable experience is an even greater one the widget channel platform is a very impressive user interface for both developers who want a flexibility and speed to market but it also provides consumers with a memorable unique approach to enjoying internet content and entertainment on their tv
6823957 it doesnt solve the two way issue as theres no keyboard
6823958 they run the risk of sinking like a stone unless they can provide tv manufacturers with a source of incremental revenue thats attractive
6823959 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6823960 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6823961 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6823962 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6823963 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6823964 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6823965 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6823966 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6823967 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6823968 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6823969 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6823970 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

6823994 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think south africa made a hasty choice
6823995 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6823996 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6823997 now its up to the icc to take a decision which they would take on sunday but i would say that south africas refusal will badly hurt the event we will still do our best to save the event and host it on schedule
6823998 we made the best security arrangements for south africa when they toured us last year and it was only at the end that they did not want to play in karachi so we relocated the match to multan
6823999 the icc has noted csas decision and will not make any further comment until the icc board meeting on sunday
6824000 non si pu vedere nel leninismo stalinismo la fatale ineluttabile deriva del marxismo teorico
6824001 non trasforma il comunismo in unidea nazista pi di quanto linquisizione non trasformi il vangelo in unidea stalinista
6824002 il capitalismo alla fine del nostro secolo globalizzato appare sempre pi simile al mondo senza rimorsi e proletarizzato profetizzato da marx
6824003 ma questo dice il new yorker non era il suo obiettivo principale
6824004 alla lettura odierna questo manifesto rimane tuttora la pi concisa esaltante cronaca di un processo che ha portato lo scompiglio nel mondo contemporaneo linesorabile spinta verso la globalizzazione gli autori infatti riescono ad analizzare la crisi del meccanismo di fondo delleconomia capitalistica con una precisione ineguagliata dai pi celebri guru dei nostri giorni e con unesattezza che confina perfino nella chiaroveggenza molte parti dellopera si leggono come unopera di grande poesia raramente la grandezza e la miseria del xix secolo sono state illustrate con maggiore forza cos mentre la maggior parte delle opere teoretiche del passato sono adesso lettera morta le vibranti frasi di karl marx e friedrich engels continueranno a scuotere e illuminare anche il prossimo secolo
6824005 il manifesto divenne non solo un testo classico del marxismo ma anche un classico della politica tout court alla vigilia del ventunesimo secolo quello stupefacente capolavoro ha ancora molto da dire al mondo
6824006 quel che torna a esser attuale non il marxismo ma la descrizione clinica che marx seppe fare della societ borghese e delle sue rivoluzioni mondialiste nellottocento e la sua capacit di osservare con sguardo profetico sic la societ gli individui il loro rapporto con lo stato le disperazioni che oggi fa impressione per questo la narrazione di marx resta utile a 150 anni di distanza non si tratta di ricopiarlo ma di imitarne la forza descrittiva per capire i contraddittori tempi che si preparano

6824046 i said how bout a revolution and he said right
6824047 these cytokines may be important for inducing the psoriasis lesions to develop or amplifying them
6824048 if you could knock them out specifically you might be able to just treat psoriasis without the unwanted side effects of more general immune suppression
6824049 and i think that if we could stop the cells from getting into the skin you may even be able to prevent psoriasis
6824050 the idea of resident versus inflammatory dendritic cell populations provides a useful model
6824051 im hoping that other investigators will find this model helpful as they look at dendritic cells in different diseases and different organs
6824052 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6824053 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6824054 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6824055 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
6824056 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
6824057 four countries have now decided against coming to pakistan i probably shouldnt bracket the other three england australia and new zealand with south africa as they have yet to announce their decisions but from what we are hearing they will probably do the same
6824058 rescheduling is a problem because of the tight international calendar involving all teams and every board is aware of this and we have been preparing very hard to make the champions trophy a safe and successful event
6824059 south africas decision is all the more disappointing for us because they came to pakistan last year and were satisfied with the level of security we provided them on the tour
6824060 we shifted a match from karachi to lahore on one occasion to ensure best security for them pakistan cricket has been going out its way since 9 11 to accommodate and ensure touring teams are given state level security
6824061 the icc is trying hard to assure all teams that conditions are safe to play in pakistan and a teleconference of the executive board is to be held on sunday south africa should have waited until then
6824062 well have agreement when we have agreement so all of those stories in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until we have an agreement
6824063 all in all it was a terrific day for us

6824067 has made it very clear that he doesnt want to sell the operation they have many other options before they would consider something like this one
6824068 i would be very surprised by any deal that would lead to complete control
6824069 that would elicit a lot of questions and political blowback im sure thats not going to happen
6824070 it is rare for the k d b to invest such a large amount of money in a firm
6824071 ive got to chuckle being on vacation this week theres nothing relaxing about the religious mac versus windows war raging in apple watch comments the comments are fun reading and i want to thank each commenter this post is in response to some of you who opined about the topic
6824072 but first ive got a response to everyone nitpicking aside about value and spec versus spec and price versus price comparisons mac average selling prices are much higher than windows pcs

6824074 im always looking for a bargain im in charge of buying technology for a small rural school district i dont spend much time deciding between sli video options for my students
6824075 that being said i still just bought a whole slew of macs for the k 8 schools i support
6824076 why did i pay more because os x is a great choice did i mention that these imacs have built in wireless and only run a moderate premium over comparable pcs once you add in a 17
6824077 there are a few truths that we all find self evident all men are created equal only even numbered star trek movies are any good and home built pcs are always cheaper than anything apple has to offer
6824078 gird your loins fellows because what i am about to tell you will shock you make sure that no children can see the screen because this news is not for the faint of heart toms hardware has found that assembling your very own home brew version of the baseline mac pro configuration using comparable parts will save you about twenty bucks when you add a license for os x the cost of ilife and the time and frustration youll spend getting all that software and hardware working together you actually would be better off just buying a mac pro
6824079 hows this for the ultimate digital age small business irony want the best possible environment for microsoft office try running it on a mac
6824080 the apple line of personal computers and peripherals offers the small enterprise a tantalizing if frustrating set of risks and rewards macs used as they are intended in their full 64 bit glory are blazingly fast
6824081 for the most part office 2008 for mac simply emulates office 2007 for the pc but in my testing this riff on the microsoft flagship flourishes in the current apple os x leopard environment
6824082 e mail and calendaring in entourage is simply unparalleled the software is written to support the internet message protocol imap outlook does too as do other clients but none i have used are as quick or as fluid as entourage on the imac

6824091 many of you had trouble accessing gmail for a couple of hours this afternoon and were really sorry the issue was caused by a temporary outage in our contacts system that was preventing gmail from loading properly everything should be back to normal by the time you read this
6824092 we heard loud and clear today how much people care about their gmail accounts we followed all the emails to our support team and user group we fielded phone calls from google apps customers and friends and we saw the many twitter posts we also heard from plenty of googlers who use gmail for company email we never take for granted the commitment weve made to running an email service that you can count on
6824093 intels nehalem processor architecture will still hold to the core naming scheme when it appears late this year if an apparent leak of company logos proves authentic
6824094 weve already shown our affection for apples highest end imac but with back to school shopping season in full swing the time felt right to fill in a gap in our review database by covering the lowest end 1 200 20 inch model what we find is that the most affordable imac has the usual content creation strengths weve come to expect from apple and while some of its features stand out from the competition were disappointed by others overall we recommend the 20 inch 2 4 ghz imac if you have a budget between 1 000 and 1 500 for a desktop that youll use for digital media editing
6824095 we could win the gold medal in every single track and field event but if we dont win a single thing in the sprints and relays the public will view our performance as a disaster
6824096 when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster
6824097 we can be a much better team and we will be
6824098 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs it will include assessments from inside and outside the usatf family
6824099 included in the assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6824100 they all say more or less the same thing the dropped batons were reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership i agree
6824101 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes
6824102 ultimately the athletes on the track are the only ones who can successfully pass the stick around the track but they need proper leadership and preparation
6824103 theres no denying we have had more than our share of bad luck
6824104 the public sometimes sees these things and sees only failure rather than the nature of the games
6824105 when the mens marathon concludes on sunday well still be the worlds number one team in terms of medal count
6824106 in the mens and womens 200 im not sure there was any stopping the jamaican juggernaut at least not when it comes to gold medals
6824107 nobody from any country was going to beat 9 69 and 19 30
6824108 we wont have nearly as many gold medals as weve won the last two world championships and gold is what gets it done

6824114 brazil is the country that is in the best conditions to become the global champion in biofuel production because it has farmable land a variety of oleaginous plants and technology available
6824115 biggest challenge for the northeast is to increase agricultural production both for food crops and for biofuels we started with 6 000 planted hectares then increased the area to 25 000 and hope to reach 80 000 hectares when the government launched the biodiesel program the number of cear inhabitants involved in family farming rose from 2 000 to the current 10 000
6824116 together the investments in the three plants added up to r 295 million and they will generate work and income for 55 000 family farmers who were hired to provide the raw materials
6824117 today is a historical day for quixad and for family farming which will plant 120 000 to 130 000 hectares in the semi arid region of cear the producers of which will be able to sell their products free of middlemen

6824122 at the same time that the national right to life committee has unearthed documents proving that barack obama repeatedly voted against a bill that would have protected children born alive after an attempted abortion illuminati pictures has released a video of an interview with a nurse who witnessed the very practice that obama protected while in the illinois senate jill stanek was a nurse at christ hospital in oak lawn illinois in 1999 when she discovered that babies born alive after failed abortions purposely were being left to die in the soiled utility room which says stanek is a room where biohazard materials and soiled linens are disposed of barack obama can play word games but at the end of the day his opposition was responsible for living babies being left out to die and that is indefensible concludes stanek
6824123 obama cover up revealed on born alive abortion survivors bill
6824124 new documents just obtained by the national right to life committee nrlc prove that senator obama has for the past four years blatantly misrepresented his actions on the illinois born alive infants protection bill now the uncovering of the senate committee action report sheds new light on senator obamas four year effort to cover up his real record of refusing to protect live born survivors of abortion
6824125 echoes of 1860 is life a question of states rights
6824126 in the original governing principles set forth in the declaration the right to life is one of three specifically identified inalienable rights the original documents both the declaration and the constitution make clear that the primary purpose of government at all times and in all situations is to protect those few inalienable rights if the philosophy originally set forth in the declaration of independence and subsequently secured in the constitution is rejected the belief that there is a god that he gives inalienable rights to man and that the purpose of government is to protect those rights at all times even when the states refuse to do so then there is no longer a unique american philosophy of government that will distinguish us from the rest of the world the founding fathers established federalism to preserve states rights but they also placed the protection of inalienable rights far above the level of states rights candidates who desire to lead the nation should follow the framers example and conform to the principles set forth in the declaration of independence and the constitution protecting life and marriage through the constitutional process those early leaders wisely provided
6824127 pro life is not a campaign slogan for me as president i will immediately work with congress to pass the sanctity of life act which would strip the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court in all cases involving the life of an unborn child when that happens the unborn child would once again be declared a person under the law and cannot be harmed without due process of law appointing pro life supreme court justices will no longer give the republicans a phony rallying cry and the evil deeds of the u s supreme court on january 22 1973 will be set aside

6824130 our first look at this region suggests we are looking at one or two generations of stars that were triggered by the massive stars
6824131 we plan to follow up with even more detailed measurements of the stars ages to see if there is a distinct time gap between the stars just inside and outside the rim

6824173 if they cant organise the business of their own meeting how on earth can they organise a huge festival
6824174 we made a decision we thought right why would we take a decision we knew wouldnt be right for the fringe
6824175 it was wrong and we now have to move forward and learn from our mistakes
6824176 i think the board should apologise for bringing this festival to the brink of disaster if it hadnt been for the box office of our venue and the other three big venues everyone would have been in trouble
6824177 its not acceptable to say they cannot answer these questions till after the review this is a whitewash
6824178 there are lots of different issues to be considered including the work of the fringe society itself but we have to work together all the various people who make this festival what it is
6824179 i just dont think the board realised what a serious situation this is for all the people who put so much work into this festival they need to look at moving this festival forward and if they cant do that they should let someone else do the job
6824180 i think it does damage the image of the fringe not just with the ticket buying public but with companies like ours i dont know if id trust the fringe any more

6824218 it has been interesting learning and adapting to this new circuit
6824219 during todays practice sessions we completed our programme of learning the circuit the car and the tyres
6824220 as expected the grip level was very low to begin with and developed through both sessions
6824221 it is difficult to understand too much about our situation relative to the others but we had no significant problems which is encouraging for the rest of the weekend
6824222 we kept to our programme today which was to complete maximum mileage and verify our simulations
6824223 the circuit is both interesting and challenging and the final sector is definitely my favourite and quite exciting from the cockpit
6824224 the initial results from today are encouraging but we must now continue working hard to have a solid qualifying session tomorrow and ensure a good level of performance in the race
6824225 i was able to take advantage of the three hours of practice today to complete plenty of laps and gather lots of interesting data which will be useful for the rest of my weekend
6824226 i really like the track and its a lot of fun in the car
6824227 the level of grip was poor but we are used to this sort of thing on street circuits
6824228 i will now work with my engineers to optimise the set up of the car so that we can have a good final free practice session tomorrow morning and approach qualifying in good shape
6824229 we had a very good second session with some quick times and made some strong progress on the set up
6824230 the seamless box is working well and we can push quite hard but lets see what happens for tomorrow and qualifying
6824231 we have some issues with graining as usual but overall i am quite pleased with the day
6824232 the seamless shift is a very good step and i was happy with the progress
6824233 generally an interesting day for us as it is always challenging to run at a new circuit and particularly one that stretches the drivers
6824234 we had no real mechanical problems today only a small brake issue with giancarlo which was very quickly solved
6824235 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on set up this morning
6824236 we were able to go quicker on each run without changing too much and we took a very good baseline into the afternoon session
6824237 in p2 our adjustments were again spot on but the sheer volume of traffic meant it was difficult to immediately confirm our final set up changes
6824238 nonetheless were in pretty good shape and im looking forward to tomorrow
6824239 i immediately found a good balance at the front end and slowly dialled in the rear during the first session
6824240 but the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car
6824241 in the afternoon we made a number of changes which seemed to pay off for us by the end of the session the car was working well and the balance felt really good
6824242 its always an interesting engineering challenge whenever you arrive at a new circuit and today in valencia was no exception
6824243 we spent two very productive sessions concentrating on tyre choice while running appropriate fuel levels
6824244 lewis and heikki also performed faultlessly allowing us to collect plenty of valuable data which we will go through tonight
6824245 we have certainly addressed the bulk of the crisis here in terms of the number of people and established a strategy for the total resolution of the problem
6824246 clients would have the certainty of a favorable resolution to this unprecedented liquidity crisis
6824247 today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition
6824248 overtaking it will be difficult as always i hope i dont need to do it by getting the best position in qualifying
6824249 the set up we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
6824250 they were two enjoyable sessions with the lap times tumbling bit by bit as the drivers lapped and got confidence in the track layout
6824251 the track surface is still very dirty and it is easy to make mistakes which can lose you precious tenths to do a good lap time you have to be perfect
6824252 i like the track theres a nice atmosphere and i have to say the organisers have done a good job
6824253 today it was important that we find a good base set up immediately and we managed to do that
6824254 it was important to get off on the right foot and we did
6824255 we had prepared a baseline set up for the f2008 and it seems to be about right which meant that right from this morning we could work on improving it
6824256 both drivers are reasonably happy with the handling of the car
6824257 now we have to analyse all the data we have gathered to work out how to move forward in terms of getting the best performance
6824258 today the track has been very dirty which was in fact predictable

6824277 many fish are hard to tell apart once theyve been filleted and packaged
6824278 we hope our work lights the way to getting mislabelled and endangered fish species out of grocery store refrigerators and frying pans
6824279 this not only raises concerns of consumer fraud but also public health
6824280 we are not certain where the mislabelling occurs but it seems it is not the fishermen since the mislabelled fish are from completely different parts of the world
6824281 perhaps the mislabelling occurs somewhere in the middle when the fish are filleted and no longer easily identifiable
6824282 in the fifth century there arose yet again the question of just who jesus is it was a question repeated throughout antiquity and in this case an answer to the question was proposed by the nestorians they argued that the mortal man jesus and the
6824283 the problem with this was that it threatened the very witness of the church and could even lead logically to the notion that there were two sons of god the man jesus and the logos who was sharing a room with him in his head in short it was a doorway to theological chaos over one of the most basic truths of the faith that the word became flesh died and rose for our sins
6824284 the church formulated its response first jesus christ is not two persons occupying the same head

6824291 i planned on sitting behind tim just off his shoulder and using his pace and then popping him at the end

6824329 we have to bring our a game against the united states any team who expects to beat them has to bring their a game
6824330 we expect a hard physical game we hope for a great spectacle for basketball
6824331 we know what we have to do and we did really well when we played them last time and we have improved since then we have a lot of talent and more experience
6824332 our girls will be ready no matter who we play
6824333 the media have been talking about usa versus australia since the pre olympic diamond ball tournament
6824334 playing for the country and competing in the olympics is a big big honor

6824348 blackburn rovers are delighted to announce that roque santa cruz has signed a new four year contract with the club running through until 2012
6824349 i dont think any player certainly not those two will be leaving
6824350 as a blackburn fan it would be a tragedy if they left so im sure the club wouldnt allow that
6824351 you could bid 30m for roque and im sure they wouldnt let him go in my opinion
6824352 roque is a tremendous player as is benni we are a club that is trying to achieve things ourselves and you couldnt let brad friedel david bentley and roque santa cruz go in the same season theres no way the club will let that happen
6824353 you can see why sometimes premier league managers dont let their players go if they are going to start playing them for 90 minutes
6824354 its always a worry you wonder if youll come back with a half a team im disappointed with some of the managers because they played some of my players for 90 minutes as in andre ooijer roque santa cruz and steven reid
6824355 i spoke to reidy and he feels fine but thats not the point hes had problems with his knees over the years
6824356 morten gamst pedersen played 45 minutes for norway and i havent got a problem with that but when you start playing them for 90 minutes in a friendly i think is absolutely ridiculous
6824357 i can understand it if its a world cup qualifier but not a meaningless friendly when its a friendly i think youve got to show a bit of appreciation
6824358 the league has just started they have had a hard pre season and now ive got six players who have played three games in a week which is unfair
6824359 youve seen it over the years even with the biggest teams that when players go away with their countries they struggle to perform on a saturday and weve got to make sure that doesnt happen to us
6824360 sometimes you can be selfish because they are your players but you have got to show some appreciation for them for the saturday and i think 45 minutes for a friendly is appropriate

6824369 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6824370 somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6824371 5 1 percent is still a relatively low unemployment rate but higher than we usually see in the triangle
6824372 there is no question the economy is slowing and the rate of job growth is not keeping pace with the growth in the labor force

6824379 we recommend adding a small amount of homemade whey w hey supplies lactobacilli and acts as an inoculant do not use commercial concentrated whey or dried whey you may omit whey and use more salt in the vegetable recipes but whey is essential in the recipes calling for fruit
6824380 lacto fermented vegetables increase in flavor with time according to the experts sauerkraut needs at least six months to fully mature but they also can be eaten immediately after the initial fermentation at room temperature lacto fermented vegetable condiments will keep for many months in cold storage but lacto fermented fruits and preserves should be eaten within two months of preparation
6824381 d o not be dismayed if little spots of white foam appear at the top of the pickling liquid they are completely harmless and can be lifted off with a spoon the occasional batch that goes bad presents no danger the smell will be so awful that nothing could persuade you to eat it
6824382 god damn when are you coming over i miss you

6824384 it feels like some outside force is shoving me around
6824385 people seem to not even see what is right in front of them like they are in a trance
6824386 i love your photos and the few blog entries i read made me both cry and laugh amazing pat
6824387 i think thats what scares me the randomness of everything that the people who could be important to you might just pass you by or you pass them by how did you know should i turn around and talk to the mexican boy maybe he was lonely like me maybe he read denton welch
6824388 i could not believe that i was out and when i heard last night i was in the final it was my time

6824390 were both very competitive and cannot stand to lose we love to travel love to do adrenaline like things love to experience new cultures and learn
6824391 we love to try new things give us bungee jumping parachuting paragliding and parasailing any day
6824392 we are competitive were in shape and were going to kick ass
6824393 lets hope that no one will take us too seriously so we wont be recognized as a threat until its too late
6824394 irrelevant or inappropriate message sent on the internet to a large number of recipients
6824395 in the world that i study everybodys trying to kill the biofilm
6824396 but theres not a concrete answer for that and thats why you need to understand methods
6824397 thats why we can be one of the few labs in the world that can focus on methods development
6824398 every time a person buys a product with an epa approved efficacy claim such as kills 99 percent of bacteria the public trusts the validity of the process used to prove that claim
6824399 our goal is to grow bacteria in a way thats relevant to how the bacteria exist where the product is used
6824400 that way we can have more confidence in the products actual effectiveness and so can the public
6824401 so many results depend on the process a person uses
6824402 to have only one way to grow a biofilm isnt going to cut it
6824403 there is no place like home for home is where the heart is
6824404 i am pleased to sign this legislation to take illegal guns off the streets and make our communities safer for our children
6824405 the people who buy and sell multiple guns illegally are contributing to the violence in chicago and throughout the state and should to be held responsible for their actions
6824406 this law will hold these individuals accountable for illegal gun purchases and will hopefully help stem the tide of gun violence that has taken the lives of far too many
6824407 individuals need to be held more accountable when their actions with guns are reckless
6824408 while this is just one step in the movement towards common sense gun laws it is a step worth taking if it means one less person and their family will be victimized
6824409 we appreciate the efforts of the governor and the general assembly in passing this important legislation
6824410 increasing the penalties for the unlawful purchase of a firearm is essential in reducing crime and protecting our communities individuals who violate this statute will now face longer prison terms the more severe penalties will act as a deterrent to those who contemplate committing such an act
6824411 because honey is sweeter than sugar replace 1 cup of sugar with a generous 3 4 cup of honey because honey is liquid and adds liquid to a recipe use 2 4 tablespoons less of other liquid in the recipe because honey is more acidic than sugar and add a pinch of baking soda unless of course the recipe already calls for sour cream or buttermilk to neutralize the added acid since honey will make the baked good brown faster reduce the cooking temperature by 25 degrees honey will make the baked good darker and denser than sugar think of a traditional honey cake with a wonderful flavor and a delicious moist texture
6824412 participating governments exchanged views in a constructive manner and agreed to meet again in the near future to continue their deliberations the group said in a statement on its web site
6824413 this year montana was required by no child left behind to dramatically increase the hurdles our schools must meet to make ayp
6824414 it is important for everyone to know that the quality of our schools continues to improve every year despite significantly higher requirements
6824415 according to the 2007 national assessment of educational progress naep 8th grade students in only two other states scored higher than montana students in reading these same students rank 10th in the nation in math montanas 4th grade student math scores improved by 14 points among american indian students and improved 18 points among low income students receiving a free or reduced meal
6824416 while it is important to continually raise the bar and challenge our students nclb places all the emphasis on only one test
6824417 other states have eliminated spring break and art music and p e classes in order to spend more time teaching to the test i dont want to see that trend in montana
6824418 the ayp report disregards the value of all that a good education provides
6824419 it looks only at specific measures required by the federal government nclb rates all schools and districts based upon the results of one test given to students once a year
6824420 the office of public instruction has assembled montana school support teams composed of veteran montana educators to work with school districts having the most difficulty in meeting the requirements of the no child left behind act
6824421 these teams are shining examples of how we can work together in fact powell county high school and box elder 7 8 made it off of the ayp improvement list this year

6824435 i recently challenged my colleagues to step up to the plate and help me provide the resources our candidates need to compete in races across the country to match the dscc expenditures in targeted races
6824436 it has become clear that my call has gone largely unanswered
6824437 it is only a response it is not the russian side that provoked it
6824438 the incident seems to be meeting same the criteria but were not sure if its the same group as suspected in previous robberies
6824439 as with any crime the first priority is safety and to report it immediately
6824440 it takes away from my clients service because it takes passengers that would otherwise use my client
6824441 the other threat is really to public safety theres simply no assurance that the people who are providing the service under pickuppal are properly licensed and insured and that their vehicles are safe

6824446 theres a disconnect between the antiquated laws and carpooling companies who are trying to help environmental goals
6824447 all buses will be permitted to use the hov lanes at all times regardless of the number of occupants to ensure reliable and on time bus service and to allow them to return to the beginning of their routes more quickly and consistently
6824448 climate change is the defining issue of our generation but we have more to do together
6824449 tackling gridlock is one of the most important things we can do to build a strong and prosperous economy
6824450 the safety board has ruled against two other companies in the past shutting down similar carpooling services in 1999 and 2001
6824451 quebecs allostop ca for instance was forced to shut down its ontario offices in 2001 after complaints by three bus companies

6824464 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6824465 july saw the highest 12 month increase since march 2003 a climb in gasoline prices was the primary source of higher consumer prices in july
6824466 besides higher prices for gasoline price increases for other energy components such as fuel oil and other fuels and electricity rose sharply in newfoundland and labrador prince edward island and nova scotia in the 12 months to july
6824467 the rise in these energy components largely accounted for the growth in consumer prices posted in these province
6824468 the slowdown in the rise in mortgage interest cost was due more to a softening of new housing prices rather than to lower mortgage interest rates
6824469 while consumers across the country faced higher prices for gasoline and mortgage interest costs lower prices to purchase and lease passenger vehicles helped to offset these price increases
6824470 changes in prices to purchase and lease passenger vehicles ranged from a 7 6 per cent decrease in quebec to an 11 4 per cent decline in new brunswick
6824471 this report offers no big surprises which is a good thing in light of the high side shocks seen in many other cpi releases around the world in recent months
6824472 and while headline inflation is now running at its fastest pace in more than five years it is still near the bottom of the pack globally and more than two points below the current u s pace
6824473 lower gasoline prices suggest that headline inflation will pull up short of the bank of canadas earlier projection of four per cent plus inflation but tough year ago comparisons in the next few months also suggest that a fast retreat in inflation is unlikely

6824479 a forgettable driving experience in all but the ss version
6824480 5 3 liter v 8 generates 303 hp and 323 ft lbs of torque
6824481 v6 offer s an agreeable blend of power and fuel efficiency
6824482 the idea of the base 211 hp 3 5 liter v 6 would drop our eyelids but the 3 9 liter v 6 is not a bad choice in this car it feels strong even at higher rpm and speed and never sounds labored
6824483 233 horsepower is enough to giddyap to 60 mph in 7 4 seconds
6824484 3 5 and 3 9 liter v6s provide similar acceleration in around town driving but the 3 9 has better passing response in the 35 55 mph range
6824485 all models employ front wheel drive and a responsive four speed automatic transmission
6824486 an lt 3 5 averaged 24 2 mpg on conventional gasoline in mostly highway driving
6824487 an ss averaged 20 3 mpg in mostly highway driving
6824488 may be tempting to power hungry buyers be forewarned that sampling its formidable reserves quickly brings fuel mileage down to the high teens with official 2008 epa ratings of 16 city and 24 highway
6824489 once the road starts to wind the impala dips leans and squats as though the road were one big yoga mat
6824490 the top level impala ss has a suspension firm enough to encourage enthusiastic driving on curvier public roads
6824491 the slightest hint of aggression will rock you out of your comfort zone
6824492 occupants will find hip and shoulder room plentiful but legroom is mediocre for a car of this size
6824493 although the redesign for 2005 greatly improved the interior the impalas cabin materials still pale next to those of the hyundai azera
6824494 cabin materials are serviceable but impala trails most like priced rivals for quality feel hard plastic expanses dominate the cabin giving it a budget look and feel
6824495 the impalas interior is a huge improvement over its predecessor and a nice enough place to spend time but competitors score higher style and quality points
6824496 wind rush and tire roar both intrude slightly in rapid acceleration the v6s emit prominent growl
6824497 the v8 is subdued at cruise but has muscle car rumble under throttle
6824498 airbags and tire pressure monitoring are standard across the lineup

6824538 the final order granted the citys request for a declaratory judgment stating i the city validly exercised its authority pursuant to subchapter c of chapter 402 of the texas local government code adopting ordinance no 16668 and creating a municipal drainage utility and ii ordinance no 16668 lawfully delegated operation and management of the citys municipal drainage utility to the el paso water utilities public service board pursuant to chapter 1502 of the texas government code
6824539 the court further ordered that in the event of an appeal of this final judgment the defendants the city of el paso and public service board are entitled to an equitable and just award of attorneys fees in the amount of 25 000 00 for appeal to the 8th court of appeals and 15 000 00 for appeal to the texas supreme court
6824540 we did not believe this fee was justified in a case where a citizen brings a action like this against government if it was not frivolous no one would be able to seek good government if all was at risk
6824541 i feel he only wants the higher courts to make the decision in this most important issue this sets law and will probably go all the way to the supreme court one way or the other
6824542 thought it the lawsuit was frivolous from the get go we had done extensive legal research its unfortunate we have to spend so much time and money on these things

6824557 column stores vs row stores how different are they really
6824558 is something fundamental about the way column oriented dbmss are internally architected
6824559 it is not possible for a row store to achieve some of the performance advantages of a column store
6824560 there is in fact something fundamental about the design of column store systems that makes them better suited to data warehousing workloads
6824561 is not that simulating a column store in a row store is impossible
6824562 couldnt find a way to force the system to defer these joins until later in the plan which would have made the performance of this approach closer to vertical partitioning
6824563 there is no reason why a row store cannot store tuple headers separately use virtual record ids to join data and maintain heap files in guaranteed position order
6824564 by the first author daniel abadi where he expands on some parts of the paper
6824565 we speculate that these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6824566 it seems reasonable that obesity increases potential negative consequences related to severe airway infections early in life
6824567 it is possible that subjects reporting otitis severe respiratory infections or living in a large family in childhood more frequently had infections in the upper airways with hypertrophy of the tonsils and subsequent narrowing of the adult upper airways
6824568 remaining large tonsils or retrognathia due to large tonsils in childhood may compromise the upper airways and could explain the associations between early life factors and snoring in adulthood as observed in this study

6824602 there are lots of people who have been waiting for two years for this and they are going to put down the money
6824603 but the numbers are clearly not going to be anywhere near what we could have expected not simply because of the price itself but because there is visibility of price worldwide and this is three times the u s price so you can actually order it off e bay including customs duty so that actually puts quite a dampener on the whole thing

6824640 staying tall and not dipping so much trying to be a little more balanced in my delivery and having my arm ready to throw downhill and not push the ball

6824643 the pakistani government and the military in particular are not monolithic
6824644 in some areas theres very good counter terrorism cooperation with us in other areas there is plenty of room for improvement there are elements within the government and military that might have some links to militant groups in the region that is a matter of concern
6824645 we have not received any specific evidence of any military officer helping terrorists
6824646 if we are provided specific evidence we will take action
6824647 if there was any collaboration of any sort to help the militants you would not see these sorts of things against security officers
6824648 the pakistan army is very professional organization it is one of the best armies in the world
6824649 it is instructional and with the endorsement of haq and brohi it became policy

6824702 now the question is if its feasible or not its exciting that theyre also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day

6824717 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
6824718 trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement
6824719 the real contest is always between what youve done and what youre capable of doing you measure yourself against yourself and nobody else
6824720 weve been hearing the same thing the past two years
6824721 were really not caught up into it until they start cutting the first tree
6824722 when i was a freshman they promised the improvements were going to be here and they promised it last camp in 2007 im never going to see it
6824723 i dont think the reason we lost was because we got out strengthed and teams were better
6824724 i felt it was more internal i think we had too many individuals on the team last year
6824725 i felt i needed to go back to the other role
6824726 its hard to feel the pulse when youre 100 percent into the game
6824727 today was kind of the day of guys going to scout team redshirting that type of thing
6824728 there were a lot of meetings today a lot of talking
6824729 were going to continue to evaluate its going to be a day to day thing but as of today seawrights the number one kicker he struggled early in camp but once he got his bearings he was very consistent gives us a little bit more range
6824730 theres going to be probably a broader rotation than weve ever had at receiver
6824731 see how they practice with game planning and that type of thing and see what the game plan turns out to be on how to use them
6824732 were going to need to have some depth at nose to keep those guys fresh
6824733 with derrick hill kendrick payne mike costanzo those four guys are all going to get into the rotation
6824734 theres nothing to gain by this there is absolutely nothing to gain other than what they perceive as a win by getting us down which is not going to happen
6824735 the pruning today was done for one reason and one reason only and that was to ensure that we can keep the tree sitters contained to a single tree that will allow us to redeploy some of our police force to meet a real increase in the demand of their services as students return to campus this coming saturday
6824736 our situation is a lot worse than advertised and we need to start making some tough choices if we want our future to be better than our past
6824737 if they want me down they will have to drag me down
6824738 we will continue to do everything possible to avoid having to forcibly remove these people
6824739 the last thing we want is for anyone our officers or the protesters to be injured as the result of this misguided effort

6824746 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6824747 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6824748 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6824751 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6824752 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6824753 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6824754 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6824755 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

6824761 our belief is that cloud computing or on demand computing is simply a way of further fragmenting data because customers are absolving themselves from responsibility for the management storage security and backup and recovery of the availability of that data
6824762 you must never ever absolve responsibility for the quality and the ownership of the data and having such quality and ownership as part of your core business processes and that requires integration
6824763 whats thats doing is its bypassing the traditional process of having it design the whole integration processes into the solution so before you know it you could be up and running with salesforce com without having put much thought into integration because its really being led by the line of business side you could have someone in the sales and marketing unit that somehow bypassed it and went up and implemented salesforce all of a sudden they realize they need access to that data they need it synchronized

6824791 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6824792 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6824797 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6824798 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6824799 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6824800 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

6824804 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6824805 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6824806 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6824807 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6824808 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6824809 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6824810 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6824811 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6824812 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6824813 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6824814 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6824815 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6824816 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6824817 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6824818 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6824819 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6824820 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6824821 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6824822 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6824823 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6824824 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6824825 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6824826 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6824827 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6824828 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6824829 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6824830 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6824831 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6824832 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6824833 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6824834 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6824835 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6824836 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6824837 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6824838 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6824839 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6824840 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6824841 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6824842 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6824843 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6824844 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6824845 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6824846 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6824847 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6824866 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6824867 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6824868 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6824869 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6824870 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6824871 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6824872 one of the options we would have is to protest the rfp
6824873 now that we actually have the selection done and out there in public its just a huge huge feeling of gratification

6824884 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6824885 by cushioning the first round economic impact of the financial stress we hoped also to minimize the risks of a so called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress which in turn further damages economic prospects
6824886 has been conditioned on our expectation that the prices of oil and other commodities would ultimately stabilize in part as the result of slowing global growth
6824887 intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to de leverage in a more orderly manner
6824888 was severely complicated by the lack of a clear statutory framework
6824889 a statutory resolution regime for nonbanks besides reducing uncertainty would also limit moral hazard by allowing the government to resolve failing firms in a way that is orderly but also wipes out equity holders and haircuts some creditors analogous to what happens when a commercial bank fails
6824890 wed like to make beach volleyball players for the future
6824891 they have underperformed the likes of which we probably have never seen from a u s track amp field team
6824892 wed like to make beach volleyball players for the future
6824893 you have to look at the new leadership here at u s track amp field and wonder if its been a vacuum of leadership there does seem to be no cohesiveness seems everyone has their own agenda
6824894 and guys to be quite honest the fact that there was a departure by the previous ceo and there was a vacancy there in the olympic year quite possibly could have meant that that vacuum of the leadership for usa track amp field has affected severely the performance of this u s olympic team
6824895 the u s relay teams laying a giant egg in the birds nest
6824896 i dont know what our government does period i ker smack
6824897 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co florida republicans boycott todays primary in sympathy with democrats iowa caucuses
6824898 we must have faith as they the original pioneers did
6824899 we just have to do our part and reach out for his hand
6824900 maybe it was for us to come here and remember the faith of our fathers maybe its not a story of suffering but one of rescue
6824901 youre 45 percent more likely to be attacked by a pig than a shark
6824902 when i was so sick and so close to death i begged heavenly father to please let me stay here longer
6824903 sunsets make me cry now because im able to see them
6824904 when they come home theyll be the kinds of men you want to marry
6824905 as were pulling remember those important men in your life and what they mean to you
6824906 as sisters in zion well all work together the blessings of god on our labors well seek well build up his kingdom with earnest endeavor well comfort the weary and strengthen the weak
6824907 lots of times as women we think we can do things alone but we cant we need the strength of the priesthood
6824908 i know the spirit has been with you this week
6824909 the emotions thats not your mind playing tricks on you thats the spirit of god touching your hearts
6824910 i learned that salvation came through the gift and grace of god not by our works i learned that believing in christ was enough i learned that the priesthood temples ordinances and prophets were all fulfilled through the sacrifice of jesus christ
6824911 god reached into my heart and changed everything i had ever known
6824912 youre not where i thought you were in stone temples made by their hands youre even closer youre inside of me
6824913 as a band we are not afraid to testify to what we believe
6824914 we talked about their mormon background in our press release
6824915 a vengeful unforgiving god full of condemnation that only gave love to those deserving of it i did not feel like i deserved his love i lived in fear of gods disappointment and punishments
6824916 i was seeing the god of the old testament and i was living a similar life as those who were under the law of moses a religion full of laws regulations and judgment
6824917 once i got into mormon doctrines i realized this is not what christ would teach we are not anti mormon just anti mormon doctrine
6824918 you know i do know that finding my dad is a pipe dream especially when you think about the obstacles involving north korea
6824919 what we want is to be accessible to be as helpful as possible
6824920 the storm is now passing over hong kong and is weakening we are considering lowering the signal
6824921 we wouldnt have come in this terrible weather if wed had an indication that they might close
6824922 the airlines should have broadcast the latest typhoon news in the airport and made arrangements for us to stay somewhere its the first time ive come to hong kong and now i have no idea what to do here
6824923 we are fortunate that the competition finished before typhoon nuri hit hong kong

6824947 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6824948 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6824949 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6824950 cannot imagine that many americans would not consider it a privilege
6824951 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6824952 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6824953 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6824954 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6824955 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6824956 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6824957 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack

6824961 nothing is more basic than our right to vote for our president and we wanted to put our own visual look to the november election to show our support for inspiration we brought back vince carters dunk over frances fred weiss in the 2000 olympics and combined it with barak obamas smooth game
6824962 because time consumption is associated with emotional experiences thinking about donating time reminds people of the happiness achieved through helping others
6824963 we argue that thinking about time activates goals of well being and beliefs involving personal happiness in contrast thinking about money suppresses such emotional goals and instead activates goals of economic utility and beliefs about attainment of such goals
6824964 not only can the remotely located patient consult a specialist
6824965 the specialist too can instruct the patient for specific test procedures and treatment
6824966 answering the running mate question with any specificity is above my pay grade
6824967 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
6824968 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
6824969 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
6824970 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
6824971 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
6824972 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world

6825066 those safeties are going to have to play older than they are
6825067 i dont know that it was a death spiral but i mean it was a pretty dire situation
6825068 there have been very substantial gains at this point dont take any of this to imply that we think were anywhere near finished

6825078 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6825079 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6825080 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6825081 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6825082 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6825083 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6825084 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6825085 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6825086 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6825087 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6825088 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6825089 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6825090 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6825091 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6825092 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6825093 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6825094 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6825095 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6825096 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6825097 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6825098 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6825099 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6825100 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6825101 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6825102 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6825103 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6825104 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6825105 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6825106 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6825107 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6825108 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6825109 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6825110 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6825111 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6825112 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6825113 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6825114 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6825115 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6825116 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6825117 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6825118 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6825119 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6825120 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6825121 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6825122 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6825123 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6825124 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6825125 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6825126 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6825127 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6825128 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6825129 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6825130 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6825131 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6825132 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6825133 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6825134 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6825135 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6825136 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6825137 persiapan kita sudah maksimal hingga saat ini semua sudah sesuai rencana kemarin kita sudah melakukan testing tapi settingan terakhir yang paling mantap jadi kita akan mencoba maintain nya saat balapan besok
6825138 treknya saya rasa ada beberapa jalan yang lebih halus dari tahun lalu sehingga kendalanya menjadi lebih kecil sekarang tapi ya itulah reli semua orang mengalami hal yang sama tapi kita memperbaiki pace note kita saja sekarang
6825139 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
6825140 regents report on uw counseling is a wake up call
6825141 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6825142 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6825143 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6825144 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6825145 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6825146 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6825147 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6825148 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6825149 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6825150 this is a planning took where all things are going
6825151 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6825152 we have to get more resources but we also need to have better high performance plans to maintain a place in the top five because that is what our rivals are doing
6825153 those athletes were judged not ready for this olympics but we are in a good position going into 2012
6825154 that was our last major run as a team and it was pretty good
6825155 some of the factors are hard to explain and hard to see but you can tell everyone is very responsive when someones talking you get a lot of eyes directed straight at you
6825156 at the contest at the breakdown guys are really getting in there getting stuck in i tend to think thats a good thing
6825157 the positive mindset to put ourselves under as much pressure as you can at training and to execute under those pressures are some of the things that have been going on this week
6825158 i dont think there were any uppercuts just good intensity there is no question that is going to be really important on saturday
6825159 you cant help but look at a teams form leading up to a test match
6825160 part of that is doing your analysis of how they are playing and part of it is probably in their mindset as well
6825161 in the last test in new zealand we knew they were going to come out to us with a fair bit of intensity and unfortunately we didnt match it
6825162 thats probably going to be the case again this time hopefully we will match it
6825163 its a massive challenge in front of us south africa are a really proud nation especially at home we are expecting a significant battle
6825164 they have the world cup tag so there is still an underlying confidence with that
6825165 it wasnt too long back when they secured that amazing victory in dunedin the last couple of matches they may not have gone as well as they would have liked to
6825166 ive got no doubt theyll look to bounce back there is still a lot of confidence in their team
6825167 they are missing a few guys bryan habana and bakkies botha who are quite crucial for them but theyve still got guys who are the worlds best in their positions they are a pretty handy crew
6825168 i think thats a good thing there is a lot less baggage among this crew at the moment
6825169 we possibly saw that in that first test against the all blacks in sydney and hopefully we can see that over the next two matches
6825170 it was a long time ago great memories about that whole trip that whole era really
6825171 it was a victory that reflected the team at that time we were involved in many wins where we came from behind and won late that was just one of a number of times we did that
6825172 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6825173 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6825174 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6825175 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6825176 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6825177 i will loose 30 lbs in the next three months
6825178 i will loose 10 lbs a month for three months
6825179 just look at the money china has spent on infrasturcture ports roads
6825180 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6825181 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6825182 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6825183 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6825184 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
6825185 our industry is changing and we need to tailor products and services to what customers value and provide them with more choice
6825186 by any measure the pilots believe the proposed changes are a disastrous strategy that would only drive away customers and encourage them to choose other airlines
6825187 i am trying really hard to not have to go that route
6825188 servers for both red hat enterprise linux and fedora linux were compromised in recent weeks by some kind of illegal access
6825189 so youve been the ibm aix guru on your team for years now and your bosses have determined that they want to try linux on linux rises to top dog in servers
6825190 this has been an exceptional way to introduce open source customers to the larger ecosystem behind the products they love and the linux product insider rhel 5 2
6825191 servers for both red hat enterprise linux and fedora linux were compromised in recent weeks by some kind of illegal access neither ubuntu 8 10 to use linux 2 6 27 kernel
6825192 generating buzz this morning with the release of the linux 2 6 27 rc4 kernel is word that ubuntu may switch to the linux 2 6 27 kernel for rebooting the magic way
6825193 wouldnt it be nice if there was a way to ask the kernel to reboot without needing to access the failing drive well there is a way using linux for photography where we stand
6825194 i promise i will not turn that into a habit but after quite a few months and more than 100 entries in this blog i feel like it
6825195 unless masaba repents within four days and take only four wives from the herd he remains condemned to death according to sharia law
6825196 any muslim who married more than the approved number of wives at a time either by mistake or out of ignorance is instructed to choose but only four and ask for allahs forgiveness
6825197 i cant wait one race to go one more medal to go
6825198 im definitely confident a medal is a medal and whether its bronze or gold id prefer the gold but im looking forward to it i know that
6825199 the guys took off pretty fast so i just had to sit there and maintain myself and just try and come home at the end
6825200 all i was thinking was hurry up and get to the finish line but it just didnt seem to get any closer after about 100m i thought to myself oh my god ive got 900m to go but before you know it theres 300m to go and you think oh i better get going
6825201 the mind is still saying go go go get to the line but the body is starting to fall apart
6825202 he was that far back and i thought oh no
6825203 aside from the olympic trials that was his best performance
6825204 we were never going to miss this we wouldnt miss this for anything in the world
6825205 we drive off each other all the time so of course it wallaces bronze gave us confidence
6825206 this is easily the best year of my life thats the best result of my career by far
6825207 we were definitely the lesser known of the race but we knew after the heats that we were a chance to do something pretty special
6825208 we were fortunate that we ended up with a fairly outside lane
6825209 we went in as the underdogs we were only ever considered fourth to sixth
6825210 it worked in our favour to work on our own race we have a race plan that we have been building on over the last six to eight weeks
6825211 we were able to execute that pretty perfectly without being influenced by what the other crews around us were doing
6825212 after our heat we looked at our performance and decided we had a little bit more room to kick home a little bit earlier than what we had we were holding back a little in the first half to give ourselves a bit more in the end and we came home well
6825213 ive coached a lot of wonderful players but i dont know if ive coached anyone tougher than him his mental toughness to absorb what he does and play like he does week in and week out year after year
6825214 hes just one of those blokes who puts himself in the right spot every time hes just an incredible bloke to play with
6825215 all our top players were back a guy said to me recently if youre going to have a bet in the finals see which team has the smallest injury list and its a pretty good tip
6825216 weve had four players missing in our last two games and that hurt us and tonight theyre all back and look at the difference look at the gold coast theyre obviously not going to make the play offs now but they were missing luke bailey and prince broken arm for long periods of time and their season went out the back door
6825217 what can you say we sit up there and watch all the heartache but they are the ones who go through all the pain
6825218 gsd amp m idea city is highly regarded in both their creative and media capabilities
6825219 their integrated approach will make them an even more vital partner in moving our brand forward
6825220 after forty if you wake up without feeling any pain then youre probably dead
6825221 they came in glass jars and the inside of the cap if you put your nose right up to it smelled like pork it was some kind of trick i believe this was used by the jewish manufacturer to attract his own pork starved people and that trick is as much proof as one needs about the ingenuity of the race
6825222 certain events and characters in this novel were inspired by real people and events but the actual events characters and dialogue depicted are all fictional
6825223 i was trying to borrow the money to pay some bills that i have
6825224 now that i have lost the 550 i have not been able to pay my august rent this made me further behind
6825225 these scams target people who are in desperate need of money because theyre unable to borrow money in traditional means
6825226 unfortunately they end up further in debt because these people who run these scams have no compassion
6825227 losing the money caused us to have our wedding rings repossessed because we could not make the payments
6825228 to ensure the continued success of our enterprise we are constantly evaluating the size and placement of our work force including the way we staff and prioritize work
6825229 this action helps rationalize the size of our work force relative to the size of our customer base
6825230 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6825231 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6825232 the attachable plan must be bought in conjunction with any one of three domestic or two global data plans for pdas smartphones customers still have to shell out 45 85 a month on top of a monthly voice plan and it may still boost sprints overall revenues before this pam phone as a modem was 49 99 standalone with no base plan requirements
6825233 instead of being a fish out of water i can be generations of fish out of water who find a way to evolve and eventually grow lungs to sustain themselves in air in freedom in life
6825234 i think the smarter marketers and advertisers would find a way to make better use of their budgets i tend to view the economy as an opportunity and a challenge at the end of the day people still need to sell and buy stuff
6825235 hes well qualified for the position as the constitution says 21 years old resident must reside in the district all the other things are extra and he has all the tools necessary he knows the process
6825236 we believe the new and better format shouldnt be a luxury item and we want audiences to see our films on the best formats out there
6825237 makes me wonder whether p amp g isnt deliberately stealing a page from the indie film marketing playbook
6825238 gosh really our little brand how nice of everyone to notice we really werent expecting this are we blushing

6825244 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6825245 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6825246 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6825247 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6825248 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6825249 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6825250 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6825251 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6825252 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6825253 where do i find an affiliate program for refrigerator filters
6825254 how many internationals have they got how many rep players have they got how many origin players you tell me
6825255 im just very excited about the fact we have a team of players there if we want to make a mark in the play offs we have to improve still
6825256 i said during the week i enjoyed the good times i had at that club and respect the club for the stars and the coaching
6825257 geez some of those calls were just crap just crap
6825258 its probably an outlet on the refs for the way were playing
6825259 that wasnt the reason we got beaten we got beaten because they wanted it more it would certainly be nice to be on the other end of the count
6825260 it was 20 points how much more attack do you want
6825261 when you say was it flashy or a grind you cant do much more
6825262 these critics that keep bagging our attack should look at their own backyard
6825263 well see how he wakes up tomorrow morning but he may be doubtful for sunday
6825264 its disappointing obviously with both luke away and if craig does miss it
6825265 were getting ahead of ourselves here but even if craig does miss sunday well still have cover
6825266 weve got benny griffin whos been around for a number of years hes played a lot
6825267 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6825268 its gonna be an awesome party with more than 7 things i like its gonna be totally awesome i hope its a great time
6825269 the chatter about tepid ticket sales and rumors of a shorter than expected run are entirely untrue
6825270 there will be a process to go through but i am now unemployed because india has fallen over
6825271 i have got another burst in me i have had a break in the last four years i have been in italy on sabbatical new zealand as the cricket high performance manager and india so im ready to be back in perth where the national hockey teams are based
6825272 with a bit of luck they could be playing in the main game its that close at this level
6825273 they didnt play as well as they could in the semi final but if you look at the team they were playing they have some of the best strikers in the world with about 600 games of experience and we lost schubert and our young strikers have about 60 games between them so they are inexperienced
6825274 they had an easy ride through and sometimes that doesnt prepare you for the toughness of whats ahead whereas both germany and spain struggled in their pool games but came through
6825275 i think this is the last opportunity for a number of these players to play together and it would be gut wrenching for them to come away with nothing its gut wrenching enough to lose this match the semi final
6825276 i have faith in this team to lift itself for the next match
6825277 we didnt play particularly well against britain and some of what we saw in that match was in this game as well we need to re establish our belief and that will be the difference after this loss tonight we need to remind our players of their strengths
6825278 darrell will concentrate on what he will do best mentor coaching and getting umpires up to a higher level
6825279 the pakistan cricket board needs to learn a lesson from the indian board
6825280 see how they backed their players in australia recently on contentious issues
6825281 its easy to say look if id known how to deal with that sort of issue the communication and management issues then if i knew then what i know now i may have done things differently
6825282 but i dont believe so because theres a certain limit to what the umpire needs to do under those circumstances and i believe that both the umpires fulfilled those obligations both with the ball tampering and the refusal to play
6825283 im glad to hear that over 70 protest issues have been solved through consultation dialogue
6825284 the authorities were using the possibility of legal demonstrations as a ploy to lure restive citizens into declaring their intention to protest allowing the police to take action against them
6825285 the 35 b bus was full and another one that was turning on la arboleda avenue cut him off which made the driver brake abruptly and caused the girl to fall
6825286 this isnt the first time an accident has happened in this area
6825287 buses crash all the time because they drive at full speed
6825288 huge open environments frenetic combat daredevil acrobatics and high octane vehicle based stunts
6825289 there are extra costs associated with it if you go to jail you have to pay for your own jail stay now if you car gets impounded thats additional costs
6825290 the package that the governor put on the table does bring back memories of the old pataki budgets
6825291 il ne fait aucun doute que les russes nont pas respect leurs obligations etablir des check points des zones tampons ne fait certainement pas partie de laccord
6825292 youre into border security lets break this border between you and me universal healthcare reform it makes me warm you can barack me tonight ive got a crush on obama
6825293 as a young progressive person myself im glad to be on the obama bandwagon
6825294 swept to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution promising market reforms a commitment to democracy and re orienting his country towards the european mainstream
6825295 as we saw repeatedly in the twentieth century and as republican presidential candidate john mccain recently reminded us great conflicts often begin with small events just as they did in the two world wars of the past century
6825296 during the soviet era the west did not seriously confront the soviet union when it violated the olympic spirit hungary was invaded on the eve of the 1956 melbourne olympics the mexico city games in october 1968 were somewhat overshadowed by soviet tanks rolling into prague that august afghanistan was overrun even as moscow was preparing to host its own olympics in 1980 the soviet union was settling scores inside its sphere of influence and for the west that was that
6825297 europe is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies getting as much as 40 of its natural gas and 25 of its oil from russian fields the continents reliance on russian energy has served to significantly dampen criticism of russian actions around the world
6825298 ive seen the russians rolling into georgia i wish they had continued rolling right into tblisi once there i would have wanted to see them round up saakashvili and a few thousand of his supporters and caused them dissappear from the face of the earth forever thats the only way to deal with rabble rousing troublemakers who try to play you against powerful enemies id like to see the russians roll into the ukraine and maybe drop a few nukes just for good measure
6825299 saakashvili and yuschenko won elections orchestrated and funded abroad that makes them illegitimate even if they did it wouldnt matter that much to me im not a democratist
6825300 they held hearings and the ambassador confirmed that she had told the iraqis that the united states was not going to inviolve itself in its dispute with kuwait she also confirmed that this was the standing policy the point is someone set america on iraq in 1991 and again in 2003 all i want is to see those who did it punished so severely that the world not forget for at least 1000 years
6825301 in 1980 the iranians were in revolutionary mode they were making noises about exporting the revolutiion the pre emptive measures hussein took were essential for the survival of his country i only mentuion us support in passuing it wouldnt really matter to me if the us supported it or not
6825302 the use of chemical weapons in the south and against the kurds in the north was extremely limited and asysematic furthermore because the iraqis did not specifuically label their chemical shells much of the chemical attacks could have been accidental the very idea that hussein somehow ordered it or even knew of it in advance is idotic
6825303 huissein was in fact the ideal leader for iraq i think that five years of occupation have shown that he was able to keep the country from flying apart along ethnic lines and maintained the structures associated with a modern government his only problem was that he got on the wromng side of the regional bully israel thats when everything else including regional stability stopped mattering
6825304 iraq has been buried under a mounytain of lies propping up other lies not only would i defend hussein on virtually excvery issue but i would dare to call him the most consequential man of the second half of the 20th century
6825305 americas promise to defend poland against attack and in giving poland defensive weapons could create a diplomatic dilemma for the united states
6825306 the central benefit of the russian bear awakening is that it may in a short period of time make america look like the
6825307 its a hell of a time not to have it its the worst 1 000 metres i have put together in years
6825308 i dont know what to say im pretty speechless right now
6825309 i knew i had the ability but i didnt know if i really had it on today im really thrilled and i couldnt be happier
6825310 i looked a little earlier and knew i was sitting in fourth i have raced that guy a lot and i know he has gotten faster but i couldnt feel a thing it was really great
6825311 the gold medal was the dream for me im happy that i have the silver and i hope my country is proud of me but this silver just pushes me even harder to come back and win that gold medal
6825312 its been a slow growth its been nice to see everything evolve and take on a whole new life i started working with spike on game head in 2005 which was a weekly show where we profiled all the biggest games and eventually turned into gametrailers tv all along the way weve been working on the video gaming awards and doing small elements in gametrailers overall i think spike has an amazing story to tell gamers

6825331 esperamos que la participaci n de nigeria en la expo sea utilizada para compartir experiencias e identificar los ejemplos de las pr cticas que le sirvan para mejorar el accesos de sus ciudadanos al agua potable y saneamiento como elemento esencial de mejora de las condiciones de vida de su poblaci n

6825345 its a more complex challenge for the national committees because they have a far broader constituency to appeal to and the beauty of politics in this country is the freedom to complain about virtually anything
6825346 the hs 1200 is a modest looking headset simple lines light if not durable solid construction and spartan overall design not saying the design is bad in any way it is just not as flashy as many gaming headsets out there it doesnt feature any gaudy decals or quasi futuristic curves where it doesnt need them in fact it is easy to underestimate the capabilities based on looks alone that is until you use the headset

6825356 i would say that the single top is the most subtle signal that we have been able to successfully extract from our data
6825357 in the end the signal is based on only a few events but it is not particular events that you can point to instead it is a subtle statistical difference in the population of events that tells you that the single top is in the mix
6825358 for example i could say that the population of danes is on average slightly taller than the population of norwegians
6825359 if however i had a sample with an unknown mix of danes and norwegians i could estimate the fraction of danes knowing only their heights
6825360 these 60 events differed only in the tiniest details from the rest of the sample of 1 400 events
6825361 these three discrimination methods had not been used in a search before the graduate students and postdocs who did the analyses really broke a lot of new ground

6825440 this is the first government report to present definitive conclusions that number one tobacco advertising and promotion are causally related to increased tobacco use in the population

6825522 our goal with the summit is to bring together industry professionals with varying backgrounds areas of expertise and opinions to engage in a thoughtful dialogue about water management and conservation
6825523 it is important to explore our similarities as well as our differences in order to understand how the water scarcity issue is affecting all facets of the green industry
6825524 it has always been important for ewing to educate industry professionals about timely issues pertaining to water management and conservation
6825525 a firm understanding of the value of water in our industry and how to cut down on water waste will boost our customers credibility and value in the marketplace
6825526 my thoughts changed a bit on both water use and the landscape world water purveyors cannot continue to enable the landscape industry and try to do their job for them over the long term

6825536 i do not like to talk about politics all that i like to do is business business and business all over the world we talk about gender equality and one way to promote this is to help women entrepreneurs
6825537 many people here have this resistance factor to returnees because they feel that unlike those in the diaspora they themselves stayed here throughout the war and suffered and now they should get all the jobs

6825556 yeah like there should be a health thing and a poverty thing and a food thing
6825557 school spending has been rising much faster than inflation for over fifty years historically weve done a great job getting state legislatures to direct enormous geysers of money into the government school system and in the past when people asked why our results were so lousy we just told them we needed more money but now that spending is over 10 000 per student theyre not swallowing that as much as they used to options
6825558 we definitely need to do more to shift the blame for educational failure to something thats outside of schools control
6825559 agreed but how can we do that in a way that continues to increase our budgets
6825560 well weve always said we cant be expected to teach kids if theyre poor or sick or have anything at all wrong with them right so lets tell them all social services should be brought into schools

6825600 as artists you raise your children differently you try to show them all different aspects but you cant help that music is in the house all the time and there are instruments everywhere its inevitable for them to get a bigger dose of the creative lifestyle
6825601 its just a worry that comes with being a parent

6825685 there are a lot of children that do have peanut allergies
6825686 i know what you have to do and how important it really is
6825687 he had a severe reaction and tested off the charts
6825688 when jaxson becomes exposed immediately a whole cascade of chemical events happen in his body
6825689 a kid like jaxson cant go to a uk football game because they sell peanuts and there are shells everywhere
6825690 a school environment is interesting because youve got tons and tons of kids who are not as responsible as adults
6825691 its an environment where taking precautions with peanuts is difficult
6825692 we have to be increasingly aware of these types of situations
6825693 it might be inconvenient for some but we can do this we can keep this child safe
6825694 its better for all the kids to be safe than to put one or two in danger
6825695 if other parents had a child with an allergy they would understand
6825696 hunter gets to carry a set of shots with him and thats a big big relief to me

6825699 thats a tough loss to lose a game in the last minute
6825700 ive got to give it to woodford county they outworked us the last half and definitely the last 10 minutes
6825701 we had two or three right in the first 10 or 20 minutes that we should have put away if we just have some composure in front of the goal we finish those
6825702 our guys i dont think their fitness level is quite right to play 80 minutes
6825703 when the game is tied you cant be complacent youve got to always want to win the game i think our guys toward the end were looking to tie it and not win it and they stuck a goal in the net
6825704 i think it will be a good motivator for the team
6825705 itll be something they can use in practice as a motivation to work hard our conditioning level isnt quite where it needs to be obviously towards the end of the game some of our starters looked a little sluggish
6825706 we lost 12 seniors last year but ive been impressed with the way theyve played
6825707 if we keep working hard at practice working hard at games i think we can do really well this season
6825708 i think we have the talent and ball skill we just have to get our fitness level up a little bit

6825733 we have research that shows that the cost of re establishing a brand name can be far more costly in the long term and many of our clients have taken the view that this is one area they shouldnt cut back on

6825773 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
6825774 the rules for the foreign press adopted in january 2007 were simple and explicit freedom of movement and freedom to interview
6825775 the chinese police documents obtained by reporters without borders show that the police were indeed ordered to let foreign journalists work but they were also ordered to investigate the chinese who told them embarrassing things
6825776 the recent arrests of chinese who wanted to stage demonstrations or express themselves during the olympic games were examples of this desire on the part of the authorities to target their own citizens rather than the thousands of foreign journalists

6825818 digital media is changing this election in dramatic ways bringing consumers closer to the candidates and putting an even brighter light on campaign politics
6825819 younger generations in particular have jumped back into the political game because information is now available through media that speaks to them well provide an alternative to the traditional big media coverage and present a unique view of the convention with a little obama girl entertainment along the way
6825820 barelypolitical coms videos have successfully crossed the chasm from online viral hits to mainstream pop culture staples and with services like buzzwire we are distributing our content beyond the web to a mobile audience
6825821 the mobile platform is ideal for our daily dose of political news and commentary with the only independent daily coverage of both major parties political lunch appeals to all perspectives with buzzwire our coverage from denver gets to all places as well

6825829 new management has begun to shake things up and the turnaround program is well underway
6825830 the roots of some of krafts products reach all the way back to 1767 but it wasnt until 1903 that james l kraft started his wholesale cheese business from a horse drawn wagon in chicago today kraft produces many of the best known food brands in the world
6825831 in 1988 philip morris renamed altria purchased kraft and in 2000 it integrated the purchase of nabisco into kraft altria sold a small stake to the public in 2001 but maintained majority control until 2007 when the company was completely spun off as an independent company once again
6825832 under the altria umbrella kraft stagnated with declining revenues and little product innovation as a result the stock price today is within 1 of the price where it was when first sold to the public in mid 2001
6825833 new management has begun to shake things up at kraft in june 2006 veteran food executive irene rosenfeld became ceo returning to kraft from a stint at pepsico running its frito lay division
6825834 rosenfeld established a three year turnaround plan based on strengthening the management team improving and expanding existing brands and international expansion
6825835 the turnaround program is well underway several new executives are in place and the organizational structure has been revamped quality upgrades have improved the consumer acceptance of krafts products
6825836 at the same time management has cut costs with annual savings expected to reach 1 2 billion by the end of 2009
6825837 the late 2007 acquisition of danone biscuits is expected to greatly expand the companys presence in the developing countries international sales grew more than 18 in 2007 and with the danone purchase overseas operations could represent more than 40 of total revenues this year
6825838 the balance sheet is solid and cash flow is strong 2 3 billion in free cash flow in 2007 this gives kraft plenty of currency to make acquisitions buy back stock or increase the dividend any of which could boost the stock price
6825839 there are a couple of interesting large stockholders who are likely to keep management focused on enhancing shareholder value legendary investor warren buffett has amassed a nearly 9 stake in kraft also nelson peltz a well known activist has obtained two seats on krafts board of directors
6825840 recent results have been good second quarter earnings per share up 9 in spite of higher raw material costs we expect continued progress from the companys turnaround plan

6825930 by conveying the bible to people we certainly do them a most interesting act of kindness we thereby enable them to learn that man was originally created and placed in a state of happiness but becoming disobedient was subjected to the degradation and evils which he and his posterity have since experienced the bible will also inform them that our gracious creator has provided for us a redeemer in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed that this redeemer has made atonement for the sins of the whole world and thereby reconciling the divine justice with the divine mercy has opened a way for our redemption and salvation and that these inestimable benefits are of the free gift and grace of god not of our deserving nor in our power to deserve the bible will also encourage them with many explicit and consoling assurances of the divine mercy to our fallen race and with repeated invitations to accept the offers of pardon and reconciliation they therefore who enlist in his service have the highest encouragement to fulfill the duties assigned to their respective stations for most certain it is that those of his followers who participate in his conquests will also participate in the transcendent glories and blessings of his triumph

6825935 we cant keep the christians from going to church we cant keep them from reading their bibles amp knowing the truth we cant even keep them from conservative values but we can do something else we can keep them from forming an intimate abiding experience in christ if they gain that connection with jesus our power over them is broken
6825936 so let them go to church let them have their conservative lifestyles but steal their time so they cant gain that experience in jesus christ
6825937 this is what i want you to do angels distract them from gaining hold of their savior amp maintaining that vital connection throughout their day

6825939 tempt them to spend spend spend then borrow borrow borrow convince the wives to go to work amp the husbands to work 6 or 7 days a week 10 12 hrs a day so they can afford their lifestyles keep them from spending time with their children as their family fragments soon their homes will offer no escape from the pressures of work
6825940 over stimulate their minds so that they cannot hear that still small voice entice them to play the radio or cassette player whenever they drive to keep the tv the vcr amp their cds going constantly in their homes and see to it that every store amp restaurant in the world plays music constantly this will jam their minds amp break that union with christ fill their coffee tables with magazines amp newspapers pound their minds with the news 24 hrs a day invade their driving moments with billboards flood their mailboxes with junk mail sweepstakes mail order catalogues amp every kind of newsletter amp promotional offering free products services amp false hopes

6825942 let them be involved in soul winning but crowd their lives with so many good causes they have no time to seek power from christ soon they will be working in their own strength sacrificing their health amp family unity for the good of the cause

6826154 there are handling costs associated with surfboards that we have to account for

6826203 aside from a couple of scenes involving zero gravity it really doesnt do all that much with the potential and the story is barely even there
6826204 i greatly enjoyed the combination of bardem and cruz together in fact i almost wish that you could go back and see the prequel to this and see the early part of their relationship and how it unraveled

6826212 the hydrogen commuter train is exactly the type of initiative envisioned when the ontario liberal government created the new 650 million next generation jobs fund mcguinty said ontario liberals want to expand the fund by a further 500 million after the october 10th election

6826216 ontario liberals think ontarians can and should lead the development of hydrogen alternatives for the world
6826217 the ndp leader doesnt support expanding the toronto subway with the cars thunder bay is building
6826218 a vote for them could lead to another conservative government and a threat to our jobs and future the conservatives dont support the next generation jobs fund and they want to take 500 million out of public education
6826219 we need to protect and move forward to protect ontarios publicly funded education system
6826220 the work being done here in thunder bay is the future our made in ontario future lets move forward together

6826223 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
6826224 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university
6826225 abu huraira reported allahs messenger may peace be upon him as saying the last hour would not come unless the muslims will fight against the jews and the muslims would kill them until the jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say muslim or the servant of allah there is a jew behind me come and kill him

6826228 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
6826229 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
6826230 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
6826231 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
6826232 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties

6826237 i couldnt believe the early slow pace i thought what good luck since my strength is my kick but im at least a year away from being able to kick with them dibaba was obviously born to run and shes a fierce competitor in her heart and soul they have to fight so hard to get here
6826238 i thought we might start out at 15 30 pace and then speed up with a lap to go i tried to kick but it wasnt there i tried to maintain my composure to the end i know everyone might think im crazy but i really believe i could have won this race on the right night im going to go back and train hard and be a better more prepared athlete at the next olympics
6826239 kara really thought she had a chance to medal and she wasnt disappointed with her race
6826240 it was different from the 10 000 when after that race she thought she had a lot left in her she said friday she gave it everything she had she said she was just outkicked by a fast group of women
6826241 overall shes looking at the last two weeks as a really positive experience a great experience that is only going to make her a better runner

6826244 im a huge defar fan she came over to me before the race and gave me a big hug i think dibaba just has a lot of innate ability and she knows her body so well shes a great sprinter beautiful to watch i aspire to have that kind of form
6826245 i would love to run a marathon this year but in order to do that i would have to be satisfied with the end of my track season at the olympics

6826251 i havent been to the world championships or the olympics but ive been to big races
6826252 ive had the pressure of the olympic trials essentially its the same 400 meters track the same gun goes off ive had enough experience to prepare myself once i get on the track its exactly the same thing ive been doing the past 10 years
6826253 its been a little overwhelming figuring out what i need ive traveled a lot but the difference is learning how to travel for work and not leisure its been really nice and quiet and a great opportunity to regroup you go from being home with a million other things to do to distract yourself to being in a hotel where if you dont find things to do its not healthy
6826254 i still have the same mentality as if they were in it
6826255 it changes the dynamic somewhat but its more in peoples minds than anything i want to run smart in the rounds and run my butt of in the final
6826256 i could tell from the beginning it was a fast heat
6826257 i was a little tired at the end my legs will know what to do saturday im sure it will be a fast race then ill have the strength for it
6826258 we wanted her to get in the top three and she could not close

6826260 shes feeling a little dehydrated shes craving some salt but im not concerned shes in the finals

6826289 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6826290 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6826291 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6826292 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6826293 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6826294 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6826295 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6826296 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6826297 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6826298 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6826299 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6826300 if you trust every web site but not a government
6826301 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6826302 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6826303 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6826304 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6826305 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6826306 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6826307 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6826308 i thought it was just going to be a couple of girls from the gym
6826309 im taking it one step at a time and enjoying the moment but its not out of the question
6826310 it is time for presidential leadership on these critical issues

6826329 what we werent aware of was the damp had got worse over a period of time
6826330 because of the security gains that have been realized since the president ordered five additional brigades and marines into iraq last january
6826331 the president and every american wants to see american troops come home but not until the job is done and there is more security more political progress and more economic progress inside iraq
6826332 the security in baghdad allowed the government to come together and make some of the political reconciliation make some of the political progress that we all sought

6826343 i think its just plain insulting to say that what happened yesterday is a manipulation by new zealand and australia the truth is that fiji had run out of anyone prepared to hold a brief for it because of the contempt in which it had held the forum particularly by not even turning up this time

6826359 its not a secret that the syrians are openly banking on barack obama its not surprising that they would build bridges in advance and do this through the window of the peace process
6826360 if one of senator obamas advisers has been to damascus we just wonder how many have been to tehran
6826361 if there was no god humans would have to invent him
6826362 it is no secret in fact its known openly that i worked for the georgians
6826363 it was a secret until this story broke that ambassador kurtzer before he accompanied senator obama on his middle east trip was in syria talking to senior syrian officials
6826364 senator mccains top aide charlie black was paid to lobby on behalf of dictators guilty of terrible human rights abuses and the mccain campaign throws a fit about an unpaid adviser encouraging progress in the ongoing israeli syrian peace talks during his free time

6826527 i like driving this track it is different to other street circuits we have known
6826528 we kept to our programme today which was to complete maximum mileage and verify our simulations the circuit is both interesting and challenging and the final sector is definitely my favourite and quite exciting from the cockpit
6826529 the initial results from today are encouraging but we must now continue working hard to have a solid qualifying session tomorrow and ensure a good level of performance in the race
6826530 it was good to finally get out on the new valencia street circuit today after previously experiencing the lap on the simulator and having a closer look during our track walk yesterday
6826531 we were struggling with very low grip this morning and im sure that was the same for everyone out there the track is very dusty and if you go off line your tyres are quickly covered in dirt which makes it difficult to be consistent
6826532 we made a lot of changes to the car this afternoon which have proved positive and provided a great deal of useful information to study this evening it was nice to do a quick lap at the end on the option tyre hopefully we can further improve the car overnight and be reasonably competitive for qualifying tomorrow

6826551 evictions in cambodia are frequently carried out violently with no regard to the human rights of those affected and in violation of cambodian law military police are often used even though this is illegal very often those evicted in fact have legal rights to the land under the 2001 land law but this is ignored by a corrupt judiciary and government
6826552 the community is living along the road adjacent to their old land under tarpaulins in conditions resembling an idp internally displaced person camp the land has been fenced off but remains unused
6826553 26th april 2008 by 2006 these coastal communities had schools political representation and many householders even had papers stamped by the sihanoukville governor say hak which guaranteed them the permanent right to stay under the 2001 land law but in july 2007 cambodias prime minister hun sen of the cambodian peoples party cpp changed the designation of the southern islands so they could be sold by march this year
6826554 virtually all cambodias accessible and sandy coast was in private hands either cambodian or foreign those who lived or worked there were turfed out some jailed others beaten virtually all denied meaningful compensation the deals went unannounced no tenders or plans were ever officially published all that was known was that more than 1 000m in foreign finance found its way into the country in 2007 a 1 500 increase over the previous four years under international law evictions should only be carried out in exceptional circumstances and when all feasible alternatives have been explored with the communities he said that where evictions are justified there must be adequate consultation and notice and the evictions must be humane evicted communities should be compensated for their losses and provided with adequate alternative housing although cambodia has ratified the major international human rights treaties there is currently no law regulating eviction here
6826555 domestic laws are in any case frequently ignored by government police and courts to push through development projects including tourist development
6826556 everyone can see the potential for cambodia to develop a stronger tourist industry however it is essential that this doesnt happen at the expense of the housing and land rights of local communities current signs are not good
6826557 all applications to buy land are carefully scrutinised by the cambodian investment board which is committed to ensuring that the rights of the cambodian people are not infringed
6826558 is that the international cooperation tends to focus on lengthy drafting processes for laws and by laws and programs et cetera that are so rarely implemented on the ground that it is hard to avoid the inference that they are little more than a diversion development is clearly going on but taking place in a manner that tends to be to the detriment of all but the rich and connected

6826586 wasnt a turning point in me as to what type of person i am but it was a bit of a turning point in me appreciating the value of serving a cause greater than your self interest
6826587 that if you put your country first that everything will be ok
6826588 people dont remember how ugly the pow mia issue was
6826589 i heard people scream in his face holding him responsible for the deaths of pows
6826590 everyone knows about his temper his inability to get along with people
6826591 only an a would put together a budget like this
6826592 you are or you arent hes a very straight shooter
6826593 theres nothing unbalanced about it it always makes sense it helps him get the job done
6826594 nobodys going to recruit him to be a zen master
6826595 johns performance over 20 years shows a man who people seek out to do business with because they know hes effective
6826596 he could mock you he could needle you he could belittle you he did it to me on a couple of occasions
6826597 he always said if the opportunity arises again i would love to try it again
6826598 but it wasnt like a dream he couldnt live without
6826599 he put the campaign on his back and climbed up a mountain alone
6826600 he appears to be something different than what he was
6826601 i dont think you get to be 70 years old and then fundamentally change
6826602 mccains gyrations have more to do with figuring out his own party than anything else hes had to sublimate for obvious reasons
6826603 theyre drinking the kool aid that somehow i have changed positions on the issues all i can say is that we all grow we all grow wiser and we all refine our positions
6826604 hes attracted like a moth to the flame to the hard things
6826605 act might be getting a little tired for a man of my years
6826606 american popular culture admits few senior citizens to its ranks of celebrated nonconformists
6826607 we lack the glamorous carelessness of youth and risk becoming parodies of our younger selves
6826608 i hope it means ill still put the country first and my party second
6826609 i hope it means that ill still do what i think is right

6826625 the high cost of fuel is the biggest issue facing our industry
6826626 more than 1 900 fleets went out of business in the first six months this year largely due to the dramatic rise in fuel prices thats why were taking a comprehensive step with fuelwatch addressing specifications maintenance driver training and vehicle performance together so we can squeeze every possible mile out of every gallon of fuel
6826627 we know from our experience however that even the best specd and maintained truck can deliver poor fuel economy if the driver lacks the knowledge and training to use it efficiently
6826628 the driver has the biggest impact good or bad on fuel economy
6826629 there are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke but you and i weve been through that and this is not our fate so let us not talk falsely now the hour is getting late

6826631 wir werden im vergleich zum 1 0 gewonnenen gruppenspiel gegen spanien gar nicht so viele dinge anders machen da geht es jetzt mehr um details im vergleich zum halbfinale werden wir jan marco montag mehr ins mittelfeld ziehen und niklas meinert daf r wieder mehr nach hinten dar ber hinaus schauen wir jetzt die klassischen themen an wie unser herausspielen aus deren pressing denn die werden uns wieder viel pressen auch unser aufbau gegen deren 3 3 1 3 system ist ein thema und wir schauen nat rlich darauf was wir gut gemacht haben in dem ersten spiel motivation ist sicher nicht das erste thema denn die jungs sind top motiviert trotzdem werden wir heute am abend und morgen noch etwas in die richtung machen ich bin sicher dass es wieder ein super enges spiel wird durchsetzen wird sich am ende die mannschaft mit dem gr eren siegeswillen
6826632 ich hatte eher mit australien im finale gerechnet aber das halbfinale hat gezeigt wie stark die spanier sind die stehen auch verdient im endspiel haben eine starke mannschaft aber wir haben beim 1 0 in der gruppenphase bewiesen dass wir sie knacken k nnen wenn wir mit einer guten defensivleistung auf das pressing der spanier reagieren f r mich pers nlich ist die situation nat rlich eine ganz andere als bei der wm in m nchengladbach da habe ich das finale von der trib ne aus verfolgen m ssen wir k nnen hier morgen mit ganz breiter brust auftreten die spanier werden sich geh rig respekt vor unserer entwicklung in diesem turnier haben die chance ist gro sich den traum zu erf llen
6826633 es herrscht eine sehr gute stimmung im team wir freuen uns alle total auf das finale die freude ist darin begr ndet dass wir es geschafft haben diesen langen weg zu gehen und dass nun der tag gekommen ist an dem wir uns den traum erf llen k nnen von dem vorher so viel

6826639 it was great the car was stable and straight as an arrow
6826640 before they showed me the timing i thought wed gone about 135mph 217km h
6826641 theres no perception of speed when youre out there except for the mile markers
6826642 this is a remarkably significant deal for us because what it does is change the world for us
6826643 we were once a spectator in the process we are now truly a partner of the crown in relation to the protection and restoration of our ancestral river waikato we are hugely excited about that
6826644 it is said that around every bend in the mighty waikato a taniwha can be found
6826645 in the three years of this negotiating process i think we can all agree that we found every single one
6826646 with this agreement the crown is showing waikato tainui that we are committed to restoring the health of the waikato river and to a clean up process that will be one of the most important environmental undertakings in new zealands history
6826647 they should have said to dallas stay where you are and brought out another runner or parked up the truck they were not only risking the life of my boy but the other two boys as well
6826648 even though he sommers is gone his spirit is still here
6826649 the kids used to carry his ashes to the bedroom and put him on the couch and watch tv with him
6826650 you do whatever you can to try and move on from that terrible accident
6826651 we dont want a blanket ban which will restrict people from sitting down at the point and having a glass of wine with a barbecue and when you start putting exceptions in the laws become too cumbersome
6826652 we tend to over complicate our bylaws its better to look at what outcomes we want and how to police it if it is too hard to police it wont work
6826653 we are drawing a line in the sand about prohibited acts in relation to alcohol that is the essence of the problem and we are putting out a message to the police that it is unacceptable for anyone consuming alcohol to behave in a bad manner
6826654 how am i going to get one of those birds
6826655 suddenly in the upper levels of swartkrans and sterkfontein man is there he is in charge and the predators are no longer with him compared to this victory the rest of our achievements may be seen as so many frills
6826656 lady if we dont get those books back by the end of the week we are sending your name to our collection agency blood from a rock llc
6826657 hes gone away and left it for someone else to clean up
6826658 you can tell theyre shepherds dogs that have probably worked in the yards at the freezing works
6826659 i dont think well have too much company on the streets but i wouldnt be surprised if we do
6826660 i think its ok theres still so much unknown about what the true impacts are going to be
6826661 were a federal government agency so theyve alerted us to various things that might happen and the building is having to take extra precautions
6826662 there is a lot of companies actually having lunches catered in so their staff doesnt have to compete for restaurants
6826663 last month we delivered plans to ensure that downtown residents and workers can get around and access their buildings with ease during the three days that the democratic national convention is at the pepsi center and now we are doing the same for the final event at invesco field at mile high
6826664 it doesnt affect us all that much hopefully well see how well it turns out

6826672 i designed it all two years and eight months ago it was at a time when everything in whitianga was moving quickly and in theory everything we wanted to do should have gone ahead
6826673 after everything we went through we didnt have quite enough money to proceed and the cost of building jumped quite dramatically
6826674 just compare prices of things now to what they were three years ago and youll see its just what the market does people have been making money off selling old homes for a long time and its just come to an end
6826675 price wise the homes range from 295 0000 for a two bedroom plus study duplex to price by negotiation for a three bedroom and two bathroom stand alone house estimated to sell in the late 300 000s
6826676 there are nine different floor plans from 95 to 137sqm each with their own freehold title the complex is located close to the beach township and whitiangas new thermal pool complex which is due to be finished in october it also has a heated pool for residents to use
6826677 you buy the house on a freehold title but if you want to do anything to it you have to go through the body corp
6826678 i felt that work was never supposed to be that hard and they needed a days break to refresh
6826679 they are carrying out council policy its council policy i am putting under the microscope here
6826680 i think the whole parking policy has to be looked at and some really interesting ideas might come out of it we have to encourage people to come to the city
6826681 maybe we could have swipe cards for people that work in shops in the inner city and have free parking for them
6826682 i cant complain on the odd occasion i have had parking tickets i have deserved them
6826683 if that is the case we may have to dig up and replace cables
6826684 i can only serve those with exact change in cash
6826685 it really reflects the confidence there is in the dairy industry
6826686 they have achieved what they wanted to achieve there and are looking to another challenge
6826687 probably two lots of per hectare prices that could be worked out
6826688 to work it out over the whole farm probably doesnt give a true picture
6826689 he was quite unwell but hed had a gastro bug that past week
6826690 he took himself off to bed with his bucket and paddy aarons dad and i decided to take him to the doctor in the morning
6826691 i was about to get him up thursday morning and i heard him fall out of bed he was really distressed really photophobic and all over the place
6826692 when i got there they had already taken him for a ct scan
6826693 they had to knock him out in ed because he didnt want to be treated
6826694 all they could tell us at that point was he had some sort of massive infection attacking him
6826695 the thing that struck us is that its so prevalent in the community
6826696 apparently up to 30 per cent could be carriers but be healthy and not realise we were quite shocked
6826697 aarons also in a reasonably high risk group which i didnt realise it was something i had always associated with babies and toddlers
6826698 you hear its quick but you dont appreciate how quick we had no idea
6826699 people can say what they like about public health but it gets my vote
6826700 even if your child has had the menzb vaccine they can still get other strains of meningococcal if your child is unwell and you are in doubt please seek medical advice
6826701 i could see the look on the drivers face it was like what can i do
6826702 there was another bus in front of the car that just made it off the bridge in time the red kia picanto car was at the end of the bridge and the bus came along and pushed it backwards
6826703 theyre on their way back home now i think theyll be really anxious to see their parents
6826704 yesterday was the best day since it rained after the drought
6826705 i think it is the worst winter we have had
6826706 there has been no break in the rain we have had other years where we have had more rain in a month but its just been wet every day we get just 10 or 15ml every day and that goes on for weeks on end and it doesnt get a good chance to dry out
6826707 the cows dont like it the calves dont like it the farmer doesnt like it the rain makes me grumpy just ask the boys
6826708 its not so nice getting up in the morning out of your warm bed and going out and having cold rain on your face
6826709 even putting an electric fence up becomes more difficult you are wearing heavy clothes every step is harder to take because you are in the mud and you are worried about the damage you are doing to the paddocks
6826710 busy or feeling a bit miserable as it was bucketing down again
6826711 the calves run around with their tails up in the air and are happy
6826712 that hasnt happened they just hunker down and try to get shelter
6826713 at the moment we are all right but the cows ruin more than they eat
6826714 if you are genuine about your farming you worry about not being able to feed your cows properly i get a lot of pleasure out of seeing well fed happy cows not only is it good for the cows but its profitable
6826715 i cant apply nitrogen for grass growth because it will just end up in the river
6826716 if we can have two or three sunny days we will lose most of our surface water it makes a big difference
6826717 we finished about 9000kg of milksolids down and the costs came up
6826718 it should have been a really really profitable year with the high payout from last year but it isnt its all just being sucked by costs and this year is shaping out to be the same
6826719 but thats farming thats what we are here for thats the challenge farmers are always moaning about the weather but thats what makes or breaks the business
6826720 mondays and tuesday are usually guaranteed to be raining the weather seems to know when the boys are on the run
6826721 nine out of 10 times i will put on my wetsuit and t shirt and shorts and im away
6826722 it the wetsuit keeps you warm most definitely you wont catch me on the truck in the rain ill be running running to keep warm
6826723 we always pray for a fine day weve had some pretty shocking days with the weather but you just see the money coming in at the end of the day and it keeps you chugging along
6826724 great theres work for the bros this side of the divvy
6826725 id rather be here than at home its just part of nature you accept it or you dont whether it is wet or dry we muck around with rubbish if your heart is set on it then its not a problem
6826726 the last few months have pretty much just been rain you get used to it but you dont like it
6826727 its not so bad in the yard where you can get under shelter but on the run you are on the back of the truck and cant run to shelter
6826728 you get used to it and build up a pretty good immunity
6826729 we have a pretty tight team were usually laughing most of the time
6826730 you work faster definitely and get it done a lot quicker because you dont really want to stay out there
6826731 i think yesterday was the only day that we have worked that it hadnt rained once
6826732 the shovelling is harder and a lot heavier the water mixes it all up so its slushy
6826733 you just get poo flicked all over you you look in the mirror and there is like crap dirt all over your face you get way more dirty in the rain
6826734 i only have two pairs of pants so if they get dirty too bad
6826735 when its raining for a whole week you get a bit sick of it
6826736 check out the size of their poo i dont clean their enclosures some spider monkeys sitting on a tapir
6826737 theres a bit of mud in there then takes her over a bridge along which walks a tame pukeko tripping over its long toes to keep ahead while ducks dabble in water below
6826738 theres just a lot of poo and a lot of raking to do it gets really heavy
6826739 there are plenty of animals that dont like the rain but there are always one or two people that come to the zoo regardless of the weather says stephens
6826740 its the waikato you need to be able to see the animals while it is raining
6826741 soft the 44 year old hamilton man bought his jims mowing franchise about seven months ago as a business venture not a lifestyle therefore he goes out on the job rain or shine
6826742 a lot of guys do it for a lifestyle so dont really make a go of it drinnan says of reports that lawn mowing companies are finding it impossible to get work done because of the endless wet weather
6826743 there are a lot of guys that are behind on their lawns and blame the rain but im ahead with mine
6826744 this season has been a lot more difficult in that we are getting a lot of rain at once but its not constant rain just on off on off
6826745 there have been other seasons where we have had three weeks of nothing but torrential rain
6826746 you use a hat as a thermostat and thermals under the jims mowing signature range fluro yellow and green tee drinnan reckons wearing appropriate clothing is a start to working in adverse weather conditions ive always worked outdoors at sea crayfishing and on the land working on farms
6826747 give it a shake and the rain just falls off you have to dress appropriately ive seen guys go out hunting before who you find nearly dying of hypothermia because they dont dress warmly enough for the conditions
6826748 its the same when you are out on a job if you have to work with weather its best to get on with it and work in harmony with it
6826749 your mower cant pick it up and it will look like a butchers hook or during an absolute downpour he says its
6826750 if you use a lighter plastic mower not a heavy alloy one it doesnt sink down as much and leave big tracks in the grass
6826751 we are also quite lucky in the waikato because the soil here soaks quite well you can get a deluge but it will dry out quite quickly and no two lawns are ever the same so there is always one you can cut somewhere
6826752 of course i have my low days where i cant be bothered going out but youve got to do it
6826753 sorry we are slow but how fast can your house move

6826756 since nobody is talking about this it must be happening because if it wasnt happening people would be talking about it
6826757 behind the scenes campaign led by forces outside bloombergs office who want to see a pro business mayor in office
6826758 term limits were a bad idea when they were conceived the best and proper way to limit someones term in government is to vote them out of office however bloombergs looking to carry out an end run around the process if he believes so strongly that term limits should be abolished take the case to the public and put it up for referendum
6826759 he has plenty of money to spread around to get what he wants if he goes through with it i think all of these so called good government groups should organize a mass petition drive to stop it in its tracks now
6826760 this guy is so ridiculously narcissistic hes really taken the whole non partisan independent thing to a whole level and milked it for all its worth i hope more people can see through all his little power plays
6826761 if the council does pass such legislation and the mayor signs it into law expect an outcry and legal challenges
6826762 the citizens of new york city voted for term limits this is not venezuela where the leaders can arbitrarily decide how long they will stay in office if he somehow pulls off changing the term limits law i hope the city of new york votes him out on his ass
6826763 considering the clowns running for mayor i say go for it

6826767 we have a mix of youth and experienced players we have had a solid build up and i think the squad has prepared well for this competition
6826768 sure we have a young side but what they lack in experience they make up for with enthusiasm
6826769 this is probably one of the youngest front rows that waikato has put out but weve just got to make sure we work together keep the talk up and it should be a good experience
6826770 obviously i havent had a huge amount of experience at this level but the best way to go about it i suppose is to bring the confidence i have from all the rugby ive played and see what happens
6826771 i didnt really expect to be at the level i am now i was just stoked to make the wider training group
6826772 we all knew it was going to come down to him staying on the bike
6826773 youve only got one shot at winning so youve got to go out there and make it happen
6826774 once youre in front of the race you control it when youve got arms legs and elbows in the way it makes it pretty hard
6826775 no hay derecho al ruido que tenemos que soportar y a que no podamos estar tranquilamente en casa para que alguien gane dinero
6826776 poner de relieve la contaminaci n ac stica y el ruido que supone el circuito para estos barrios
6826777 el aislamiento del barrio de natzaret donde los vecinos no pueden salir andando sino que tienen que hacerlo en autob s p blico o en coche particular
6826778 el mal uso del dinero p blico haciendo otro circuito cuando en la provincia de valencia ya hay uno en cheste y cuando la ciudad tiene muchas otras necesidades como un colegio p blico en natzaret o un centro de salud en el grao
6826779 es exagerado el impacto ac stico al que se nos somete en contra de nuestra voluntad
6826780 se comprometi con los vecinos a que la guardia civil tome muestras de ruido
6826781 si el delegado cumple su promesa y como sospechamos los niveles de ruido son superiores a los permitidos en suelo urbano
6826782 a n as se recomienda el uso de tapones pero para los vecinos ni siquiera se han creado una serie de recomendaciones
6826783 en el barrio se percibe que ha venido mucha menos gente de la prevista
6826784 como prueba en las inmediaciones de las taquillas hay muchas personas ofreciendo entradas para la reventa
6826785 est n medio vac as y no hay demasiada gente
6826786 no se justifica las molestias que est n causando a los vecinos que no podemos ni estar tranquilamente comiendo en casa
6826787 aunque no venga gente el ruido que hace el coche es el mismo
6826788 como ha venido menos gente no ha habido problemas ni ha aglomeraciones
6826789 s lo se puede circular por una salida secundaria en el camino de de la punta del mar y todos los accesos est n muy controlados por la polic a local
6826790 el pp ha antepuesto el espect culo y el negocio a costa de la salud de los vecinos
6826791 esquerra unida ha sido la nica fuerza pol tica que se ha manifestado desde el principio en contra del circuito urbano de f rmula 1 en valencia por su coste econ mico y su impacto ambiental mientras el resto de partidos callan o se suman a la fiesta
6826792 camps y rita barber han antepuesto el espect culo y el negocio a la salud de los vecinos que deben sufrir niveles de ruido que superan el umbral del dolor y que por lo tanto pueden ser perjudiciales para su salud
6826793 si esa medida de protecci n tambi n deben tomarla los que est n tranquilamente en su casa
6826794 por la irracionalidad de construir un circuito urbano que el propio consell de la generalitat valenciana reconoce ha costado 70 millones de euros cuando a 30 kil metros tenemos el circuito de cheste que podr a haberse empleado perfectamente para la carrera

6826797 she would be very proud of what her brother is doing
6826798 i got one of those horrendous phone calls at three oclock in the morning that you dread it was very tough she was just coming into the prime of her life
6826799 i struggled there were some tumultuous years at the beginning i vented it out in a variety of ways
6826800 the loss of a child would be on a different scale
6826801 but when i met him in person i realised why he had reached the top in cricket this was someone who if they set their mind to something it would happen we did have earl spencer come to new zealand to speak at the first fundraising dinner and now chris has started his walk
6826802 not just for louise but for every family who has suffered the impact of a rail tragedy you could not get a more passionate rail safety ambassador than chris
6826803 they are just kiwi blokes and they shouldnt have to be exposed to things like that
6826804 it takes a long time to stop you just sit there and watch it happen
6826805 it was dark about 5am i heard a thump by the time we stopped it was about 1200m 1500m downhill with a train load of 800 tonnes i went to inspect a man had been lying asleep on the track i didnt see him just heard the thump and hoped it was a sheep or dog
6826806 some have left the job because of it the bulk of the jokers get on with it you get counselling and come back to work after a few days you can have much longer if you like
6826807 what shook me was looking down from my cab and seeing the boys injured and they were pretty much the same age as my own two sons
6826808 we want zero deaths we dont want to get out of our cab and find someone with a leg chopped off when these things run you over you dont get a second chance

6826823 as chief of the colorado state patrol and a motorcycle rider for the past 14 years i know there is nothing like the freedom and exhilaration of riding a motorcycle in our beautiful state but with that freedom comes responsibility and certainly some danger
6826824 every year for the past nine years the number of motorcyclists killed on our nations highways has increased
6826825 some of these fatalities can be attributed to drinking and riding
6826826 in every state it is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol concentration bac level of
6826827 far too many people die or suffer debilitating injuries as a result of impaired riding particularly among middle aged riders and baby boomers of all age groups motorcycle riders between 30 to 49 years old have the highest rates of alcohol involvement in fatal motorcycle crashes
6826828 it is extremely dangerous to drive any vehicle while impaired especially a motorcycle which requires a great deal of balance and coordination but no matter what you drive it is a crime to do it under the influence of alcohol or drugs
6826829 now through labor day the colorado state patrol and law enforcement agencies across the state are intensifying dui enforcement efforts as part of a national crackdown drunk driving over the limit under arrest if you choose to commit this crime you will be caught and arrested
6826830 people do things they regret when theyre drunk but riding a motorcycle or a vehicle should never be one of them
6826831 well these guys are saints i should feel this way too but this sounds nuts
6826832 is this what god wants of me doesnt he want me to be happy am i missing something here
6826833 life is pain highness anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something
6826834 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday
6826835 its rare that people dont file any amended reports if he has a pattern of lots and lots of amended reports that would be more noteworthy than an occasional one
6826836 all of this just seems like an awful lot of money and time spent on political campaigning for an organization that purports to exist to help low income consumers
6826837 acorn has a long and sordid history of employing convoluted enron style accounting to illegally use taxpayer funds for their own political gain
6826838 now it looks like acorn is using the same type of convoluted accounting scheme for obamas political gain
6826839 assist persons and organizations who advance the interests of low and moderate income people
6826840 its rare that people dont file any amended reports if he has a pattern of lots and lots of amended reports that would be more noteworthy than an occasional one

6826845 voters care a lot more about candidates personal ethics than about how many houses or residences or doghouses that john and cindy mccain own
6826846 the reality is that barack obama purchased his million dollar mansion in a shady deal involving a convicted felon and it raises questions about his ethics and judgment
6826847 did you see what happened when cuauhtemoc got into the game he lifted his team thats what a player like him can do
6826848 i was into punk and then i found out zen was more punk than punk
6826849 were one of the biggest teams on the planet so its bizarre although we pressed in the second half we fell to another set piece which really sticks in the throat
6826850 we dont want to overreact because weve had a mad 20 minutes
6826851 i thought they overpowered us physically which in a strange way is going to be good because its a lesson learned very early
6826852 its also a message to everyone that were not the chelsea of the championship
6826853 hopefully the reaction will be good and we cant wait for the next game now to put it right
6826854 we are great with free kicks we get but its a question of tightening up at the other end it was the problem last year and we dont want a repeat
6826855 we are going to work hard at defending corners and freekicks its unbelievably important get that right and you wont go far wrong
6826856 you know how important cesc is on the creative side of our game and you want him to be in the team but we do not want to face a gamble for just one game and we have to be patient
6826857 we will have to assess him on monday or tuesday to see how big a gamble it will be to start him or not
6826858 we are not in a desperate situation because we have song back from the olympics abou diaby does not look too far away and hopefully we can get good news from tomas rosicky in the next two weeks
6826859 im feeling less optimistic right now we are looking at something but if it doesnt come off then we will carry on as we are
6826860 im talking about players who are different animals to when i was a player theyve had opportunities to go to clubs particularly on loan and were reluctant to do it
6826861 footballers are changing these days some dont love the game as much as they should do if you love football you want to play
6826862 it doesnt annoy me but its a sad reflection on the people themselves one or two have had opportunities in the last few weeks to go to very good clubs at a very good level just to get games theres no hidden agenda they said no
6826863 footballers are a strange breed these days trust me i thought i was strange
6826864 in an ideal world you have to reduce the size of the squad the wage bill i have a chief executive a chairman owners of the club who constantly ask that we cant keep bringing players in on top of the ones we already have at the club
6826865 some professionals have no intention of moving anywhere theres one or two of those at every club they are going nowhere unless real madrid came in for them
6826866 weve been linked with quite a few but we have shown an interest in bullard indeed in quite a few other players
6826867 whether hes actually for sale im not so sure so thats not the only iron weve got in the fire
6826868 its sic no point having a superstar in your team if the other players arent up to much
6826869 we are looking at something but if it doesnt come off then we will carry on as we are
6826870 it started in the attic area it could be electric in nature but its still under investigation
6826871 imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he is not a sense of humor to console him for what he is
6826872 if the world were merely seductive that would be easy if it were merely challenging that would be no problem but i arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world this makes it hard to plan the day

6826933 from the size of the preserved bones we estimated that omo i was tall and slender most likely around 510

6826937 most of the anatomical features of omo are like modern humans only a few features are similar to more primitive hominids including neanderthals and homo erectus
6826938 and shares more features with homo erectus and fewer with modern humans

6826942 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6826943 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells

6826989 we now need only an additional 1 400 per month before we return to italy this summer did we say only yes that amount is overwhelming but we are confident that god is sending us back to italy so were certain he will provide what we need

6827001 i was throwing poles cracking tantrums i was in a miserable bad mood your whole life it really brings it down when its really what you want to do and you cant do it just because its not clicking in your brain

6827008 para bien de muchas personas resulta imperioso erradicar este negocio
6827009 las causas fundamentales de este peligroso negocio a trav s de las aguas del golfo se debe a la negaci n de visas a cubanos por parte del gobierno norteamericano a la impunidad con que operan esos grupos en m xico y a la ley de ajuste cubano

6827029 once the government gets involved money follows along with rules and some bureaucratic thinking
6827030 theres not much communication between the two the campaign wants to see the text but its been slow in coming they dont want headlines about a clinton snub to obama
6827031 you could argue that nobody is qualified to be president
6827032 bill clinton does not think barack obama will be a great president and he doesnt want to say so but hes a pro hell give an endorsement he also likes doing things last minute and he likes to just go out there and say whats on his mind
6827033 he will bash bush and remind people that they were better off when democrats last ran the white house
6827034 you have to take the timetable of pregnancy into account

6827036 sweet werewolves of london by warren zevon wait what the eff
6827037 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6827038 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6827039 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6827040 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6827041 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6827042 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6827043 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
6827044 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
6827045 shouldnt have to search through the remains of their belongings
6827046 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6827047 having the inside of the mouth of someone else it didnt belong to me it was atrocious
6827048 in the process of securing comments for recommending the book i believe there was a basic misunderstanding on my part that the comments were publishable
6827049 general petraeus has by his own hand become a quintessential poster child of this fundamentalist christian religious predation via his unadulterated and shocking public endorsement of a book touting both christian supremacy and exceptionalism
6827050 mrff is now officially putting both army chaplain lt col bill mccoy and general petraeus on notice not to destroy any of the written or electronic records of their communications about this issue

6827055 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6827056 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6827057 adding helios differentiated postpaid offer to virgin mobile usas existing portfolio will expand both our market opportunity and our ability to deliver new products and services more rapidly we look forward to revealing our roadmap for expanded innovative offers in the near future
6827058 many of these issues start when you were either a child at home or couples who get married and they all say the first year they were married they put on 10 pounds and the second year they put on another 10 pounds because they get comfortable and they begin to take it easy so we really thought both of them brought incredibly interesting dynamics family is the key theme throughout the episodes its not just that theyre related but we really play the family dynamic throughout the series
6827059 four teams of husbands and wives versus four teams of parents and their children
6827060 we really wanted to keep it the core family keep it the nuclear family
6827061 i think theres a lot of takeaway for everybody whos watching the show to take back and use it in their own familys lives
6827062 every person is on their own journey so even though they come together as a family they each have their own experience so for me i have to approach it with whats appropriate for that person in that moment
6827063 each experience and each week is something new and different thats whats amazing about these relationships that we create when were there together its such an intense experience for all of them that im so happy to be part of it i feel its my job to be their biggest cheerleader but also to get at whats going on with them and how their progress is going
6827064 something that strikes my heart very closely is the parents and their kids and how parents take responsibility for being the role model that brought their child to this point and seeing how they deal with okay im sort of part of why youre here
6827065 obviously emotions run high and feelings go extremely deep in all the people involved
6827066 its definitely the way of the show to force them to confront not only their weight issues but the other issues in their lives
6827067 i think seeing it play out whether it be parent and child or husband and wife it really forces them to address their relationships and how theyre going to move forward
6827068 i think they compliment each other i think their dedication to the contestants goes far beyond what we could have ever expected and i think that comes through i think people really feel that bob and jillian are speaking to them even if theyre not on the march
6827069 for me the part that is most heartbreaking that you dont see you see them working out in the gym what you dont see is that its literally six to eight hours a day theres no way obviously to fit that into a two hour show jillian and bob ive known them to stay there until 1am with the contestants and help them early the next morning
6827070 these contestants this is their job its not just even a job its a career that they choose for the four and a half months that theyre on campus while we try to show as much as we can what you dont see is how comprehensive it is how intense it is it just never stops
6827071 i think they always go into it with the motive of wanting to lose weight wanting to get healthy wanting to change your life you cant subject yourself to something over that period of time without having that goal in mind but the money is a nice incentive too
6827072 you dont want to lose you dont want to go home you want it obviously the money is part of that but its the competition the spirit of challenge i think thats what they all embrace and all use to help them lose weight
6827073 while the contestants are definitely competitive they are their own support structures as well
6827074 obviously theres elements of game play that come on i think this season we found the contestants working really with one goal and that was to learn how to manage their lives better and how to become healthier
6827075 i think the one thing we practiced and preached before this season was play the game hard but dont play the game with the scale do the best you can every week on the scale and let the game come secondary the contestants this season really took that to heart
6827076 we will definitely revisit it seeing families in the future but i think equally with the seasons coming back to back with the finale of this season being december 16 and the premiere in early january of season 7 wed like to put a fresh take on it
6827077 but definitely look for families to come back in the future in terms of story and excitement the results far exceeded our expectations and hopefully the audience will go on the same incredible journey weve been on with these contestants
6827078 i think we look at the hundreds of thousands of people who have wanted to be part of the show
6827079 would never come in as heavy as they once were
6827080 its just one of those things where weve given you those tools whether you choose to live the rest of your life at that goal weight you had at the finale or you choose to allow it to even out at some other clothes size or whatever it is
6827081 were not here to tell you what your ideal weight is or what you should look like because thats not what our shows about our shows about getting you healthy and giving you the tools you need to live the rest of your life in a healthy way that youre okay with
6827082 im definitely planning on working as much as i can all the way up through until the last minute mark always teases me because im extremely optimistic about how long ill be able to stay
6827083 a lot of it is because im such a fan i love being there with them i love seeing their progress
6827084 ill be mia for a portion of it and they have plans for that

6827090 new management has begun to shake things up and the turnaround program is well underway
6827091 the roots of some of krafts products reach all the way back to 1767 but it wasnt until 1903 that james l kraft started his wholesale cheese business from a horse drawn wagon in chicago today kraft produces many of the best known food brands in the world
6827092 in 1988 philip morris renamed altria purchased kraft and in 2000 it integrated the purchase of nabisco into kraft altria sold a small stake to the public in 2001 but maintained majority control until 2007 when the company was completely spun off as an independent company once again
6827093 under the altria umbrella kraft stagnated with declining revenues and little product innovation as a result the stock price today is within 1 of the price where it was when first sold to the public in mid 2001
6827094 new management has begun to shake things up at kraft in june 2006 veteran food executive irene rosenfeld became ceo returning to kraft from a stint at pepsico running its frito lay division
6827095 rosenfeld established a three year turnaround plan based on strengthening the management team improving and expanding existing brands and international expansion
6827096 the turnaround program is well underway several new executives are in place and the organizational structure has been revamped quality upgrades have improved the consumer acceptance of krafts products
6827097 at the same time management has cut costs with annual savings expected to reach 1 2 billion by the end of 2009
6827098 the late 2007 acquisition of danone biscuits is expected to greatly expand the companys presence in the developing countries international sales grew more than 18 in 2007 and with the danone purchase overseas operations could represent more than 40 of total revenues this year
6827099 the balance sheet is solid and cash flow is strong 2 3 billion in free cash flow in 2007 this gives kraft plenty of currency to make acquisitions buy back stock or increase the dividend any of which could boost the stock price
6827100 there are a couple of interesting large stockholders who are likely to keep management focused on enhancing shareholder value legendary investor warren buffett has amassed a nearly 9 stake in kraft also nelson peltz a well known activist has obtained two seats on krafts board of directors
6827101 recent results have been good second quarter earnings per share up 9 in spite of higher raw material costs we expect continued progress from the companys turnaround plan

6827106 i dont know i have to get back to you
6827107 last year northrop threatened to pull out of the competition unless the military altered its initial bid request and the air force obliged it that time the air force blinked
6827108 the aerial tanker it proposed is no longer a good match because the air force is now emphasizing fuel capacity and it deserves six months more to challenge northrops larger plane
6827109 what we proposed 18 months ago would not fit the bill for what the air force is looking for our 767 200 doesnt fill the bill weve been looking at other configurations
6827110 needs six months to study and prepare its bid based on a different airplane
6827111 this survey demonstrates the importance of an adequately trained workforce and underscores the need for the career readiness certification programs now underway at the community colleges and joblink career centers in our region north carolina must address the identified skills gaps now if our workforce is going to compete in the global economy
6827112 he understands the ambition of the club he understands where we want to take the club
6827113 we want to be a young vibrant team with energy and technical ability he comes into the category of the kind of young player we are trying to attract
6827114 the thing i like about him is his flexibility to play exceptionally well in a number of positions
6827115 that will help the team as the premier league is a long hard season and there will be injuries unfortunately
6827116 we will need players who are adaptable and vincent will bring us that quality
6827117 the chance came at the right moment this is a club with a lot of ambition
6827118 that helped me make my decision and i am looking forward to playing in the premier league
6827119 i just had a good feeling about this move when you feel they are dynamic people at city who know a lot about football you realise you are in a good environment to improve your game
6827120 i have been through a lot of things already playing big games in front of big crowds so i do not think it will be a problem adapting
6827121 the higher the level the more challenges are put in front of you the season in the premier league is long and you need everyone i just want to help the team that is what it is all about
6827122 to assure that the region has the allied health resources necessary to meet the healthcare needs of its citizens
6827123 this is a very special boat and represents a special achievement by a hugely committed team who are among the worlds best at what they do
6827124 it was almost a no win situation for obama in some ways
6827125 by putting clintons name into nomination it seems to many people that theres still a split in the campaign on the other hand so many of clintons supporters want her name placed in nomination because of the historic nature of her campaign so if it didnt happen then those women would have another reason to not support barack obama
6827126 many people i know feel that this is going to be another hillary and bill clinton dog and pony show and i agree with them
6827127 we know that the clintons believe the candidacy actually was theirs and obama took it away with such things as race letting john edwards hide his secret affair through iowa and playing a sexist campaign obama had no choice but the clintons should have more class than to butt in on him when ted kennedy did that at a democratic convention jimmy carter the incumbent lost the election
6827128 i think he obama needs to reassure a lot of americans who dont pay much attention to politics that hes up for the job that hes ready to take over as hillary used to say on day one
6827129 and his choice of a running mate will help to some extent im sure
6827130 for him to win hes really got to reach out to social conservatives but still yet remain that maverick
6827131 i think its more of an advantage than a lot of the political operatives claim to go second in the conventions
6827132 its a great advantage the party in the white house has the opportunity to see what that challenger party is going to do in terms of running mate in terms of platform and the way theyre positioning themselves

6827147 there is not much scientific evidence to support these tests i would like to see much more regulation of them
6827148 some companies are not diagnosing food allergies and intolerances properly
6827149 experts verdict although igg testing is a validated scentific test our three expert believe that in line with our findings and other published research its use in diagnosing food intolerance is difficult to prove scientifically igg antibodies are commonly found in healthy people and do not prove intolerance only that the food itself has been eaten the experts were also concerned that the diets recommended by these tests exclude up to 39 foods which could lead to nutritional problems

6827156 i would play all these small places in new york where a lot of young musicians get their start i would do whatever i could do to get people talking about my music a couple of years into it we could get like 300 or 400 people to show up at new york music venue s o b s but at first we were happy to get like 50 or 60 or 70 people to show up
6827157 but that whole grind is just part of how you get discovered how you develop yourself as a performer i think it makes everything i do now more worth it because i put in all that time and all that effort you will not make it in this business and succeed over a long period of time unless you work really hard i had to learn as i went when i was grinding and it does make you appreciate your success it makes you realize that its really about the work its really about making the best music you can make its really about working hard at the end of the day theres only a few major stars in the music business and then theres all these people that are aspiring to be that

6827172 we will be looking at whether there has been a reduction in fights and people being picked up for severe intoxication
6827173 we all owe it to our shareholders to look at all options to improve returns and insulate suppliers from future market and currency volatility
6827174 its not our intention to engage in petty and churlish debate suffice to say alliance directors do not resile from the position and comments of our letter on august 13 to shareholders
6827175 we have requested alliance to stop quoting incorrect figures and they have maintained a position of continuing to do it so we had no choice
6827176 this debate is about farmer ownership and control value creation for the wider industry the introduction of third parties into co operatives as an equity partner and at procurement level and appropriate aggregation options
6827177 it is difficult to see how a merger that would aggregate 50 of sheepmeats by alliances own calculation with 3 billion turnover can be represented as achieving no progress and not potentially be the catalyst to industry consolidation

6827180 recently new zealand weather has been dominated by a pattern of anticyclones which can cause weekly cycles if the pattern falls on a weekend we just get stuck with it
6827181 we have to remember earlier this year we saw drought conditions these cycles typically affect weather for between three to six weeks and we are in the sixth week now so must be getting towards the end of the cycle
6827182 if theres heat there shouldnt be a shortage of growth farmers have commented to me that they are set up for best spring in years
6827183 quail rise had to hire planners lawyers landscape architects its gone on for two years and finally got an agreement and now 10 months later nothings been done
6827184 so out of sheer frustration weve put it before the court
6827185 and as soon as the land swap deal and tenancy agreement is sorted we will seal it the road and if its not sorted we will leave
6827186 to invest in the vicinity of 400 000 to seal the road a lease suitable for this investment will be required
6827187 we would have spent in excess of 200 000 in gaining consent on that land and there are times when you wonder why bother
6827188 the contractors have advised us the cost of sealing the road was too onerous given the short term lease and volumes so were working to find a solution
6827189 occasionally the stamps make their way into a special exhibition when they help illustrate a story once the collection is computerised it should make it easier for stamps to be used
6827190 were not interested in that we dont deal in the commercial market
6827191 it was de rigeur to have a collection for a long time and most new zealanders of a certain age have a direct connection at some level

6827197 the wanaka gym has filed an application in the court in christchurch for the injunction to be vacated

6827199 if work was completed it is required to be inspected in compliance with the terms of the building consent no request for inspection has been made
6827200 if thats what they have to do thats what they have to do but we are following the law
6827201 i feel we have the capacity to cope enrolment numbers are expected to remain relatively stable next year but we could accommodate an increase of 10 with the staff we will have
6827202 staff were upset and angry as you would expect them to be no one likes to be put in a situation where they have to make life decisions like that
6827203 there is very big potential a real opportunity for red wine in particular and to broaden our base away from sauvignon blanc
6827204 a persistent wine drinking culture permeates every corner of life
6827205 new zealand is ideally suited producing wine somewhere in between
6827206 when you think about china go there with the same sophistication and dedication that you do when you go to europe
6827207 the job losses and the families affected are what first comes to mind i have no doubt that the company will manage any confirmed losses through attrition as far as possible and that both unions and government agencies will be involved in seeking other work for those who face redundancy some time in the next three years
6827208 cadbury dunedins management have stated that without a significant investment such as for chocolate crumb they fear the dunedin site may cease to exist in 10 years time
6827209 the end result is a high quality crumb product which has been part of the reason for a further 51 million
6827210 cadbury has a higher technology future which will mean also a higher skilled future its productivity will increase significantly and in the future it has to be considered as a possible premier chocolate crumb manufacturer well beyond australasia
6827211 a comprehensive review is a step in the right direction we asked the ministry to look at the ruc cost allocation model which dates from the late 1970s
6827212 they also need to look at the charges system which is very bureaucratic and wasteful the fuel tax and registration system used almost everywhere else including australia and the uk is more efficient
6827213 our research indicates theres about 100 000 000 in wasted costs incurred with the current system including through compliance and through evasion and avoidance
6827214 the reason we took a bold serious step to take protest action was to get the transport ministers attention many members feel the minister has really not listened to the road transport industry
6827215 we need to create opportunities for the students and show them there is more to the city than their student life
6827216 if you believe all the bad news it would never be a good time to be in business some of our engineering and manufacturing clients are doing well
6827217 we have an eclectic mix of business in dunedin niche operators the rest of the city knows nothing about

6827219 from there weve got to talk to the council about removing the closure so we can go back on the river
6827220 were very hopeful that the council will be able to lift the closure of the river some time next week
6827221 the material has fallen into the chute below the active face and broken up only one or two rocks have reached the edge of the river making no change to the route or flow of the water

6827223 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6827224 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6827225 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
6827226 we appreciate all the efforts of the icc task team the pakistan cricket board the pakistan authorities and the security consultants the players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in september
6827227 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again
6827228 obviously yesterdays rally was overcooked and were simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6827229 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6827230 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6827231 does honesty matter in these things or if youre really cool that means you get to be a lying person whenever you feel like it
6827232 spider man looked really dumb on one of the covers

6827239 the only farmer from here to mali who had any millet
6827240 would not feel the impact the way they did in 1973 or 1984
6827241 he is a young man but he should show more respect for his rivals that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6827242 he should shake hands with them after the finish line however he is only 21 and he will learn
6827243 i am a performer i go out to let the people enjoy themselves
6827244 its good to enjoy yourselves this is my work this is my job there is no point in doing your work if you dont enjoy it
6827245 i will always be myself because that is my personality
6827246 the crowd loves it they look forward to seeing me come out they want me to do it they want me to put on a show so i give them what i want
6827247 i like to make people happy because they have paid good money to see a performance they want to see a personality so i give them a show

6827250 there is quite some concern in the community particularly young people about mobile phone premium services
6827251 at times the lack of proper disclosure of terms and conditions may mislead consumers in breach of the trade practices act
6827252 who have been confused or misled by certain marketing techniques
6827253 there is an industry scheme in place regulating the provision of mobile premium services
6827254 active steps are being taken to review this and the government encourages industry to continue this work
6827255 i act for paul hogan you know of him i will need to obtain advice from you from time to time on issues concerning his affairs there will be no need for you to talk to him
6827256 john mccains been living like this for the last 25 and obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6827257 i suppose if youve got seven maybe eight houses the economy looks fundamentally sound to you
6827258 but if youre having trouble making the mortgage payment then the economy looks awful different
6827259 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into

6827264 el repliegue de las tropas rusas ha transcurrido sin incidentes y ha concluido como hab a sido planeado a las 19
6827265 fueron habilitados 18 puestos de vigilancia en la frontera administrativa entre georgia y osetia del sur con el fin de prevenir la infiltraci n de grupos de saqueadores y de armas y municiones

6827267 we kind of had everything working against us last time in the diana we had an outside post and we were hung out wide all the way around there it was actually a little better race than it looked and it came up such a tough race the ground was just a touch soft that day and i think that having that race under her belt set her up well for today
6827268 come back to me and really mean it come fasting and weeping sorry for your sins
6827269 very pleased weve run the ball fairly well kyle orton has done a great job managing the offense and hes making the throws when he has to
6827270 my entire focus is getting ready for indianapolis and using the last two preseason games to accomplish that im going to try to work as hard as i can i think the guys have a lot of confidence in me ive been around them a while and im working as hard as i can
6827271 hes had an outstanding training camp and just became a new dad so a lot of good things are happening in his life its hard for a guy to be perfect but he made the plays we need to see that its good to see a guy come up big like that
6827272 i was happy to break out in the open and make a few cuts hopefully the fans enjoyed it im just excited to be a part of the team moving forward there was a little pressure i put on myself just to be back by this time ive been working hard and it just feels good that the work is paying off i had a lot of help getting here though so i just thank the people who helped me
6827273 were very disappointed thats not us by any stretch of the imagination we need to play better we will be good defense we will be a dominant defense
6827274 i know its the preseason but we have to get better if we plan on winning some games i dont know we just havent played well they did whatever they wanted to they ran it they threw it we missed tackles at some point we have to step up and start making plays we have good practices but then go out and play like crap
6827275 i dont remember being a part of a worse effort by a defense i know i played poorly makes me sick to my stomach the way we played
6827276 i felt good it was nice to get out there with the guys and run around i have fun when im out there i love playing football i hadnt had a whole lot of practice so i thought i might be a little rusty but after a couple plays it just kind of came right back to me kind of like riding a bike
6827277 you mean our chicago swiss cheese our hole in the dam our spaghetti strainer yea that will be interesting
6827278 last week he pulled that same pass an absolute bullet juuuuust behind the receiver which makes the receiver look bad like he cant handle ortons arm but its just bad timing from kyle oh well viva la ortonluci n
6827279 it seems like it takes our coaches a full year to do what we see as obvious so much sooner like olsen and clark on the field at the same time screens to wolfe bring in more help on the line fire ron turner and stuff like that
6827280 ok so joe buck is completely blind hester was all the way out of the endzone
6827281 this type of violent attack on a defenceless young man is deplorable and must be discouraged
6827282 it says to these thugs that you can go out and bash someone to a pulp come to court and say youre sorry and well give you a bond
6827283 these guys are street smart our system is so slack that it doesnt have the guts to hand out a just sentence
6827284 ajang told me he does not want these people to go to jail
6827285 he has been hiding because people have been in contact with him
6827286 hes changed his phone number hes moved his address and changed schools
6827287 the lack of resources and their quality on the ground the repeated aogs grounded planes in the fleet the scarcity of crews and the system of movement of crew members mean that the general feeling is one of operational chaos that places the passengers at risk
6827288 the operation continues to be a disaster and is getting worse by the day
6827289 this is the final nail in spanairs coffin and may take down sas as well it is very hard to survive the reputational damage from a crash like this and most airlines dont
6827290 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6827291 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6827292 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6827293 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6827294 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6827295 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
6827296 i may have been nancy funny but i was not french speaking nancy funny
6827297 coinciding with the olympic games theres a certain kind of extremely brutal repression that continues to reign
6827298 i told him he would always be welcome in france
6827299 showed how well he is able to turn his coat
6827300 the repression has declined during the games the worst is to come
6827301 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6827302 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6827303 we could win the gold medal in every single track and field event but if we dont win a single thing in the sprints and relays the public will view our performance as a disaster
6827304 when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster
6827305 we can be a much better team and we will be
6827306 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs it will include assessments from inside and outside the usatf family
6827307 included in the assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6827308 they all say more or less the same thing the dropped batons were reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership i agree
6827309 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes
6827310 ultimately the athletes on the track are the only ones who can successfully pass the stick around the track but they need proper leadership and preparation
6827311 theres no denying we have had more than our share of bad luck
6827312 the public sometimes sees these things and sees only failure rather than the nature of the games
6827313 when the mens marathon concludes on sunday well still be the worlds number one team in terms of medal count
6827314 in the mens and womens 200 im not sure there was any stopping the jamaican juggernaut at least not when it comes to gold medals
6827315 nobody from any country was going to beat 9 69 and 19 30
6827316 we wont have nearly as many gold medals as weve won the last two world championships and gold is what gets it done
6827317 on a film i would never let anyone else speak to the actors but in a pleasant surprise i discovered that howards music pre directed in a way in how it interpreted the emotions and pl cido is the most talented least diva like guy a 77 piece orchestra is a machine that i cant operate
6827318 theres more meaning in that choice considering where we are in the world
6827319 a weird d j vu is happening weve gone back to those times rather than giving it kitschy distance its now more resonant
6827320 may stevens paintings amp works on paper 1968 to 1976
6827321 one or two of the people ive contacted on the site one in france and a couple in america have asked me urological questions and ive talked to them and helped them a bit
6827322 ive got eight grandchildren and theyre all on facebook so they talked me into doing something about it
6827323 its interesting to talk to people from various parts of the world and find out what theyre doing
6827324 the consensus that ive gotten from the commission over the last three or four years is that they feel that theres too many people against it
6827325 for a county without having a general obligation election the only way to finance a new jail is to have an authority that issues debt
6827326 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6827327 i believed every word he said i believed he was going through hell
6827328 my heart goes out to all the people who have been hurt to make all this up is extremely crushing for anyone who has gone through cancer theres no better script than to be dying of cancer and giving glory to god in a christian context its the highest form of fraud
6827329 i saw michael talk and sing and hes so very charismatic
6827330 i decided to donate the money because i thought it could benefit more people but what a con
6827331 mijn vader is twee jaar geleden overleden en wat dat aangaat is de glans er voor mij nu echt af
6827332 een vader die zijn dochter weggeeft dat hoort er gewoon echt bij
6827333 dat was ook echt wel een million dollar wedding geworden met alles erop en eraan met bootjes varen over de vecht en een prachtig knalfeest op het eind
6827334 toch voelt het net alsof ik de dag heb beleefd
6827335 we waren zo dichtbij maar het zou een drama zijn geworden we hadden echt het hele feest buiten gepland en uiteindelijk bleek het die dag super hard te regenen
6827336 dat staat helemaal niet meer op mijn prioriteitenlijst ik zeg nooit nooit misschien krijg ik nog eens een gekke bui maar ik weet het niet
6827337 de volumes zijn laag en dat waren ze eigenlijk de hele week al
6827338 verder zien we dat de financials het toch weer redelijk doen nog wat verder omhoog geholpen door de geruchten rond lehman en de korea development bank en dat zette eigenlijk de hele markt aan het eind van de dag nog wat verder in de plus

6827341 there are a lot of details that have to be worked out
6827342 for the republicans its going to get worse before it gets better
6827343 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
6827344 i think the republican party is in the midst of a wrenching but important transition from the reagan bush era into whatever comes next
6827345 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
6827346 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
6827347 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
6827348 the republican party is going to undergo a fairly extended fight for its new identity
6827349 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party
6827350 and the first six months of 2007 may turn out in retrospect to be the bottoming out point of the republican party as an institution the 2006 elections were a tremendous wake up call
6827351 a broadly center right party that achieves the goals of the american people
6827352 theres a lot of people kind of groping in the semidarkness
6827353 trying to figure out what a post reagan post bush republican party looks like
6827354 hes always had that somewhere between independence and renegade streak
6827355 you dont have to have gray areas on your principles and values but you have to have some compromising postures in order to achieve a common goal

6827363 he had to carry a different burden than most of us and he handled it beautifully
6827364 he didnt need any coping mechanism thats just built into him
6827365 hells bells we were having monday night at the movies tuesday night at the movies wednesday night at the movies featuring john mccain
6827366 we only had the facts half right but john said nobody knew the difference
6827367 as good as any preacher that ever stood at a pulpit
6827368 wasnt a turning point in me as to what type of person i am but it was a bit of a turning point in me appreciating the value of serving a cause greater than your self interest
6827369 that if you put your country first that everything will be ok
6827370 people dont remember how ugly the pow mia issue was
6827371 i heard people scream in his face holding him responsible for the deaths of pows
6827372 everyone knows about his temper his inability to get along with people
6827373 only an a would put together a budget like this
6827374 you are or you arent hes a very straight shooter
6827375 theres nothing unbalanced about it it always makes sense it helps him get the job done
6827376 nobodys going to recruit him to be a zen master
6827377 johns performance over 20 years shows a man who people seek out to do business with because they know hes effective
6827378 he could mock you he could needle you he could belittle you he did it to me on a couple of occasions
6827379 he always said if the opportunity arises again i would love to try it again
6827380 but it wasnt like a dream he couldnt live without
6827381 he put the campaign on his back and climbed up a mountain alone
6827382 he appears to be something different than what he was
6827383 i dont think you get to be 70 years old and then fundamentally change
6827384 mccains gyrations have more to do with figuring out his own party than anything else hes had to sublimate for obvious reasons
6827385 theyre drinking the kool aid that somehow i have changed positions on the issues all i can say is that we all grow we all grow wiser and we all refine our positions
6827386 hes attracted like a moth to the flame to the hard things
6827387 act might be getting a little tired for a man of my years
6827388 american popular culture admits few senior citizens to its ranks of celebrated nonconformists
6827389 we lack the glamorous carelessness of youth and risk becoming parodies of our younger selves
6827390 i hope it means ill still put the country first and my party second
6827391 i hope it means that ill still do what i think is right
6827392 while our knowledge has been increasing about how ecosystems and species and the quality of the environment relate to human health there is a lag in concerted policy and action to address this relationship
6827393 man is a rational animal who always loses his temper when called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason
6827394 i once paraphrased mark twain on the senate floor there is no distinctly native american criminal class except congress
6827395 well ive actually been approved by the government to play a show
6827396 ive already sold 10 000 tickets there so i will be going to put on a concert for the fans
6827397 they tend to you know sometimes not want western artists in their country
6827398 i respect that but at the same time you know theres people that listen to music there and want to see their idols and stuff so its all good been approved by the government and im going to go put on a show and have fun
6827399 he is going to have discussions with his no plans to meet with officials of any other country in new york six party talks obviously recent discussions about the verification package which we have been calling on the north koreans to produce
6827400 i dont have any inkling myself at all but obviously sung kim is going to assess where things are with north korea in his conversations with north korean officials
6827401 the us government wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting
6827402 the chief did not like to lose the horses so they decided to have another contest that was to climb by night a mountain without using the trail ucanogos and some of the indian maidens would be waiting on the top of the mountain

6827404 the conservation act is even tougher than the resource management act it says the land must be used for the purpose of actually protecting its natural and physical resources
6827405 this is an area of really important biodiversity it ranks very very highly in terms of the south island this is a pristine environment
6827406 these big hydro dams are the dirtiest of dirty renewable energy theres certainly a movement in other countries away from this kind of scheme its old and outdated technology
6827407 there has to be consumer acceptance we do not know how big a hurdle that might be the science needs to be looked at and the cost too
6827408 does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment
6827409 do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal

6827415 the importance of my religion has increased as i have got older
6827416 i couldnt put a time frame on it but i have found that following the islamic way of life has a lot of beauty to it
6827417 although i was born into a muslim family i wasnt always practicing the more i have understood the differences in the various faiths i have adopted as much of islam as possible
6827418 im certainly no saint but the discipline of the islamic way of life has helped my cricket without a doubt i dont drink i pray five times a day which gives stability to my daily routine and i am generally more disciplined about my game and my life
6827419 your profile is built on how the media sees you and i dont try to be somebody i am not
6827420 if i am seen as a quiet guy all well and good but i will just continue to be who i am
6827421 in cricket your circumstances change and it is key to remain constant whether you are up or down i dont intend on putting on an act for anybody this is basically who i am
6827422 i enjoy a bit of comedy and we have a few comedians in the team
6827423 with the intensity of cricket its important you have characters to lighten the mood you cant always be serious and intense all the time
6827424 i dont know who gave this tag fab four they have done so much for indian cricket over the last fifteen years agreed they failed in this test series but it happens in cricket we should not forget their contribution in the past
6827425 this was the first series they could not perform i feel its too harsh on them since they have been constantly performing over the last decade
6827426 to put laxman in that list is not fair since he performed well sourav and rahul although were having it tough but you cannot write them off
6827427 mendis is an exception bowler he is certain to flummox opponents with his accuracy variety and trajectory nevertheless he has to make sure he continues to improve so that he doesnt become predictable
6827428 generally the carrom ball is bowled with a tennis ball but mendis bowls it with the hard cricket ball which is relatively hard difficult and he ought to be given credit for it even my googly is based on the carrom ball as i bowled a lot of it with the tennis ball
6827429 theres a month left now before australia come in we need to have match practice and gain some confidence the irani trophy is there and lots of domestic games which should give us good match practice

6827635 it makes no sense to tell the enemy when you plan to start withdrawing
6827636 all the terrorists would have to do is mark their calendars and gather their strength and begin plotting how to overthrow the government and take control of the country of iraq i believe setting a deadline for withdrawal would demoralize the iraqi people would encourage killers across the broader middle east and send a signal that america will not keep its commitments setting a deadline for withdrawal is setting a date for failure and that would be irresponsible
6827637 the united states has agreed to remove combat troops from iraqi cities by next june and from the rest of the country by the end of 2011 if conditions in iraq remain relatively stable according to iraqi and american officials involved in negotiating a security accord governing american forces there
6827638 the withdrawal timetables which bush administration officials called aspirational goals rather than fixed dates are contained in the draft of an agreement that still must be approved by prime minister nuri kamal al maliki and other iraqi leaders before it goes before iraqs fractious parliament

6827675 we took a lot of flak from many of our shareholders who just could not understand the decision to walk away from such a sizable investment such as the one we had made over the years with our dickens cider and turn left energy drinks i have said in the past that over the next decade we believe the traditional energy drink industry will start to closely resemble that of fast food and tobacco
6827676 we are just as shocked as everyone else reading about potential stroke risks we have been much more concerned about the obesity rates diabetes rates heart palpitations etc associated with energy drinks nonetheless i truly believe this is only the first of many negative articles to come with respect to those drinks this news comes on the heels of mens health naming vitamin water as the worlds most unhealthy healthy beverage it is true that timing is everything and i believe it will bode well for anyone with a truly healthy alternative in the years to come

6827692 our aggressive military activities in afghanistan are foolish and wrong
6827693 the pashtun people have extremely different values than ours values we may not agree with in any case but its not our business to try and teach them lessons with weapons
6827694 because in fact theyll be the ones teaching us lessons
6827695 were going to have to leave the place or therell be nothing left of us or of whatever weve done except the blood weve lost there after we leave so its better we leave now
6827696 what i want to do is leave it to younger filmmakers to show who the pashtun are people we falsely call taliban in most cases and why we really have no reason to tell them how to live their lives why afghanistan should be left to its own devices

6827700 when the fuel price went up they raised the prices of goods even when we told them not to
6827701 now that the fuel price is reduced they must make a similar change
6827702 this is the best deal for all malaysians and not just for those in permatang pauh
6827703 we promised the rakyat to reduce the price but if we wait until the end of the month to do it the price could rise and we wont be able to pass on the benefits
6827704 the rakyat has been impatiently waiting for me to announce it then the world crude oil price went up by us 5 rm16 50 and we decided not to wait any longer
6827705 otherwise the people will ask why we did not reduce the price when the world oil price was down
6827706 japanese scientists said friday they had derived stem cells from wisdom teeth opening another way to study deadly diseases without the ethical controversy of using embryos
6827707 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6827708 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells

6827723 we are encouraged by these signs of progress i look forward to working with keith and the rest of our talented management team to improve performance that will enable us to deliver long term shareholder value given the changes being implemented at the company we have decided not to provide guidance at this time
6827724 given the companys recent performance the board concluded that shopnbc needs a different kind of leadership and vision todays actions are in the best interests of the company its shareholders customers employees and vendors
6827725 shopnbc is fortunate to have a world class tv shopping executive like keith join the company he can immediately take on the responsibilities of president and coo to lead shopnbc operations and its team at this critical juncture the board is confident in his ability to implement the companys strategic and operational plans and work closely and collaboratively with our talented and dedicated employees to build our business i look forward to working side by side with keith to move the company forward and re build shareholder value

6827734 really the 3 0 start was what we knew we could and had to do
6827735 the china game was certainly one we had circled on our schedule because we have always played china pretty even
6827736 we traded blows again making for a very emotional game and one that will certainly be memorable for years to come
6827737 when i went out to tell them we were walking to load the bases they were completely on the same page and just looked at each other like there was no doubt that canada was going to prevail as a coach that has got to be one of your fondest moments for sure
6827738 canada had never made it to the medal round so that was certainly a point that needed to be checked off
6827739 we did it and the key was making sure that they understood that they were doing everything right in terms of getting themselves to that point even though the results were not showing up
6827740 going into the medal round having lost our last four games was not a confidence booster but in terms of playing hard and their approach to each pitch they were battling and deserved and earned the right to play for a podium position
6827741 the challenges of a young team are that you are never really sure how they are going to respond when the going gets tough
6827742 everyone deals with the stresses differently it would be great if we all could embrace the stress but it is tough and a young team generally doesnt have the experiences to go back and know the best course of action for them personally to deal with it
6827743 lori has done a really nice job of getting those players to commit to more full time training and i think its showing right now theyre playing with a lot more confidence and i think their pitching staff can be very good on any given night
6827744 i was driven by the picture of seeing 15 individuals standing on top of a podium
6827745 it was completely result oriented but then the plan was to work backward and find the best way to make that picture come true
6827746 playing is stressful between the lines but there is more time to just be and deal with your personal preparation
6827747 in coaching i knew that my medal would be earned based on how prepared and confident the athletes were going into the event as an athlete the medal or success is clearly on getting the desired result as a team and your personal stake in that result only after do you really reflect on personal growth and readiness that occurred in the process
6827748 i know that every experience i have had as a player and coach has led me down this path
6827749 i know that all you have control over is your ambition and enthusiasm and your approach to the task at hand and how you respond to the outcomes how you respond may just motivate or dissuade others to give their best effort as well i know that you must rededicate yourself every day
6827750 the entire nebraska softball team beamed with pride as we watched lori honorably lead her country in the olympics along with sheena and robin mackin
6827751 as a manager she showed great poise and game management skills as canada made its finest showing in olympic history
6827752 now we will all benefit from lori as we have the opportunity to glean from her the lessons she has learned from being a part of the game at the international level on the worlds grandest stage personally i am ecstatic to have my dear friend and counterpart back roaming the field beside me and the other huskers we are better when she is with us and among us

6827757 it is for the people of west bengal and kolkata to decide whether we are unwanted or to accept us as a good corporate citizen
6827758 the move will be at great cost to tata motors and to shareholders but there is a concern about our people a definite concern about not being wanted
6827759 there is a sense of tension violence and disruption at singur obviously it is not a conducive atmosphere
6827760 we dont want anybody to move out of west bengal but at the same time we will not bow to any kind of pressure
6827761 could take the state back to an age of industrial vacuum

6827763 we have not come to exploit the people of west bengal
6827764 if anybody is under the impression that we have made this investment and will not move they are wrong it is not a hypocritical investment whatever be the cost we will move out if the situation so demands

6828005 the false dialectic of capital and communism right and left has for decades veiled from thinking people the possibility of grasping that what happened after 1945 was not only the collapse of the final phase of christian culture but the rise of a syncretic pseudo culture grafted onto the ruins of the old a juden kultur disguised as the previous model but replacing it with a set of new values and expression whose unique driving force was the thrust of the market economy in its moments of expansion

6828011 the basic axiom of libertarian political theory holds that every man is a self owner having absolute jurisdiction over his own body in effect this means that no one else may justly invade or aggress against anothers person it follows then that each person justly owns whatever previously unowned resources he appropriates or mixes his labor with from these twin axioms self ownership and homesteading stem the justification for the entire system of property rights titles in a free market society this system establishes the right of every man to his own person the right of donation of bequest and concomitantly the right to receive the bequest or inheritance and the right of contractual exchange of property titles

6828279 weve carried out a high level of restoration to bring it back to the victorian era
6828280 we were not generating assets in several of them and theyre expensive to keep open
6828281 and our timing was bad so we decided to shutter some of them
6828282 it seems to me that if the mainstream papers like the post are going to look into michelle obamas work bringing medical care to poor south side residents her earlier position and its link to politically radical even intensely anti american community organizers deserves scrutiny as well

6828294 hey im a little confused here obamadrone cindy mccain im supposed to give a shit about whether or not she whatever with mother theresa and shes running for what office again
6828295 whats weird is i was going into an established loved successful show so part of me was thinking oh god theres a responsibility there to that
6828296 but you cant go on set every day and think i really hope i dont ruin this for everyone else involved you just have to realise yeah ive taken this job and the people around me wanted me to do it once you get down to the nuts and bolts of making the show it was absolutely and i can say this for certain one of the best experiences of my professional life absolutely brilliant there was just no down point
6828297 i can t drink as much as i used to
6828298 el objetivo del gobierno regional de participar en esta ruta inka es promocionar a moquegua como destino tur stico son delegaciones de 14 pa ses que visitan ecuador y per por cuarenta d as y durante todo su recorrido han estado promocionando en cada lugar visitado a moquegua como destino tur stico
6828299 we believe it will be significantly different than anything that has come before
6828300 i dont care just make sure i get fed soon or ill start offing people
6828301 seduce me with the best youve got because i dont really like this crap
6828302 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6828303 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6828304 the journey will be difficult the road will be long i face this challenge with profound humility and knowledge of my own limitations but i also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the american people
6828305 you never stop at a red light ever every time you walk into a room they play a song and your airplane is so cool that they make movies about it
6828306 i am not a prude in fact i am quite broad minded but this is completely inappropriate for children
6828307 i bought the book for my niece as a present and was reading it when i came across the word
6828308 the book has an attractive cover and is clearly for children they should not have to be subjected to trash and vulgarity
6828309 i did not expect this from a well respected author and do not want my young niece to have to see this obscene slang
6828310 she comes to visit me regularly and we read to each other
6828311 we have all the enid blyton books such as the famous five and secret seven and had finished all of them
6828312 i thought i would get her something a little more modern and had heard about jacqueline wilson through the popular tracy beaker television series
6828313 i knew she was held in high regard and had been a childrens laureate but thought i ought to read through the book to make sure it was not too sad
6828314 i got to the page where reference was made to a toffeenosed twit
6828315 on the next page the word changed i thought i was mistaken but then i saw to my shock it had been repeated twice again
6828316 i asked her if she was aware of this word and if she could do something about it
6828317 i would like her to explain how she would want me to explain this to my daughter even if it is in the context of the character
6828318 in the context of the character we felt it was used in a way that accurately portrayed how children like jodie would speak to each other
6828319 the book is aimed at children aged ten and over and we felt it was acceptable for that age range
6828320 however in light of this response we have decided to amend the word when we reprint the book
6828321 since the book was launched in march this year we have sold over 28 000 copies and this is the first complaint we have had
6828322 jacqueline wilson books are extremely popular with our customers and are the top selling childrens books in most high street stores
6828323 the book is aimed at children aged ten and over and we felt it was acceptable for that age range
6828324 the publisher is aware of the word that is featured in the book and has agreed that it is not appropriate for children and will be reprinting copies
6828325 as soon as these copies are available we will stock them in our stores we are sorry for any upset caused
6828326 he came up with a niche performance while the rest of you sit on the internet arguing about which is better mac or pc
6828327 it would probably have a hard time convincing an a list rapper to carry a prototype sidekick
6828328 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6828329 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6828330 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6828331 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6828332 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6828333 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
6828334 i may have been nancy funny but i was not french speaking nancy funny
6828335 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
6828336 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
6828337 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
6828338 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
6828339 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
6828340 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
6828341 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
6828342 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
6828343 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
6828344 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
6828345 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
6828346 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
6828347 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
6828348 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone

6828355 the ioc has taken a more liberal approach allowing reuse on the internet
6828356 im still a great believer in tv on mobile phones because everybody gets it everybody loves tv but it hasnt really happened
6828357 i know practically nil about internet backbone hardware but thats what the cisco experts are for
6828358 knoppix is a version of linux that boots and runs from cd rom it doesnt touch the hard drive which makes it nice for people wanting to try linux without installing it for a quick setup in a disaster shelter the advantages are many
6828359 1 theres almost no installation required just insert cd and boot
6828360 3 since the operating system is on cd its physically impossible for malware to alter it if the system gets infected all you need to do is reboot
6828361 sure without using a hard drive your capabilities are limited
6828362 it seems to me the linux community missed an opportunity here well ill be talking to our local red cross branch and see if i can hook them up with some linux volunteers someday it might be our community that needs an internet kiosk
6828363 you know it would really benefit you if you would learn how to use phatic language
6828364 ill believe it when i see it sounds familiar hold on seeing or in the case not seeing is not always believing heres a test to show that your eyes can play tricks on you
6828365 even a 50 year old adult would have trouble processing such a monstrous notion
6828366 an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres
6828367 later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress
6828368 do you favor overturning roe v wade and lawrence v texas
6828369 the move since the beginning of the conflict is almost entirely driven by rising geopolitical tensions and investors taking off the bet on the russian economy
6828370 its pretty clear that were back to the worst geopolitical tensions since the end of the cold war
6828371 so long as russia remains confrontational investor sentiment will remain poor towards russian equities the ruble and fixed income markets
6828372 no one clearly wants to buy the sell off yet
6828373 people are waiting to see how the conflict evolves and whether it blows up into a more serious issue
6828374 but even so we estimate that there was roughly a 15 billion capital outflow last week
6828375 we now have an idea of the magnitude of those interventions
6828376 the size of the outflow is also an indication of the sheer magnitude of long ruble positioning
6828377 the fed looks firmly on hold for many months caught between ongoing inflation concerns existing relatively low rates and the financial storm he talks about
6828378 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6828379 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely the fed is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
6828380 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6828381 right now the situation is still getting worse and i would say that i dont see any early end to that
6828382 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6828383 that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth
6828384 nothing like that i was just doing a scene in the hills at chatsworth park where i had to kneel down next to an oak tree and get my asshole banged out by two black men
6828385 higher fines for very new and popular books and also commonly used reference manuals combined with lower fines for everything else

6828398 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
6828399 they are a prime target because theyve got money and theyve got a worry and you can combine those two and offer them a false sense of security which is exactly what this is
6828400 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6828401 whether or not the surge worked is the wrong debate to have
6828402 the fact is that our military presence in iraq was and remains a huge strategic mistake that continues to ignore our larger national security efforts supporters of the surge ignore the damage our military presence has done to our relationships with countries around the world the serious strain put on our military the massive costs to our domestic economy and the loss of so many lives for the sake of our national security and the security of the region we must change direction from the failed iraq and middle east policies supported by george bush and john mccain
6828403 its one thing that john mccain has made so many false claims about the surge he claimed that it started the anbar awakening when the anbar awakening was already well underway when the surge was announced and he seems to confuse sunni and shia repeatedly but this false argument that opposing the bush policy could only be done for political reasons is the place where reason and debate go to die you call him out on the facts and he questions our integrity that sounds an awful lot like george w bush
6828404 my opponent would rather lose a war than lose an election
6828405 his whole argument when it comes to foreign policy and how his judgment is superior is all based on the surge
6828406 he will argue he is wrong on everything else but i stood by and committed to doubling down more troops in iraq and general petraeus was with me and i seek victory and obama wants defeat let me just close by saying this i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last seven years against john mccains anytime and i think that an objective analysis will say that ive been right a lot more than he has for all that time he has spent in washington
6828407 the road from 9 11 through chechnya to bali and now mombasa is a clear one
6828408 small al qaeda groups can infiltrate in and out very quickly weapons are available everywhere it is not complex these are not large groups of people just two or three who plan for a while and then launch several rockets
6828409 the rockets fired at the grandchildren of monkeys and pigs from the south of lebanon were only the start of a blessed in depth strike against the zionist enemy
6828410 i am emanuel barak commander of ein gedis rescue team and security chief of the tamar regional council
6828411 you must be asking yourselves whats that zionist pronounced in a yiddish accent doing here i came to give you an abbreviated workshop on how to hike safely and how to spare me and the rescue team volunteers a headache
6828412 you yeshiva students know how to direct your prayers toward the east but when youre on the ground you lose all sense of direction thats why you must learn how to read a map and get your bearings
6828413 the greatest danger every hiker faces is dehydration you need at least six liters of water no less
6828414 each dont mess with me we just got word of a group that dehydrated in the judean desert each
6828415 if you dont know how to swim dont go on any hiking trip with water
6828416 right but if you get hurt and the inquiry shows that you walked on a marked path youll get insurance fees if you walked on an unmarked path youve had it
6828417 one rabbi asked me in surprise why do yeshiva students need instructions
6828418 its not enough to hand out leaflets you have to work systematically
6828419 all the expenses of rescuing hikers are paid by the state we jews help each other and must turn the world upside down to save lives

6828421 the secretary general is concerned by the recent escalation of tension in georgia he is troubled by russias statement that its military aircraft deliberately over flew georgian territory in violation of its territorial integrity
6828422 these actions raise questions about russias role as peacekeeper and facilitator of negotiations
6828423 the main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between u s and georgian forces
6828424 mr zardari thanked the central executive committee for backing him and said he would announce his decision within 24 hours
6828425 we think we can do something really ambitious and really great thats going to speak across all the users of the game not just hardcore users and that will result in some awesome stuff and not just final fantasy covers

6828430 the big names signed on kobe bryant lebron james dwyane wade and they checked their egos at the door jerry colangelo built the team and mike krzyzewski a college coach molded it by the time they came to beijing they were a dedicated unit determined to show the world not just that american nba players are the best in the world but also that theyre not the self centered spoiled brats that many people thought they were

6828433 invasion of wolves across the alps from italy nationality of ms bruni is a source of fascination to the wildlife service and biologists who observe their behaviour and track their movements with almost obsessive interest one such biologist is a canadian johnstone who identifies totally with the wolves giving them names and ascribing a personality to each feeding rabbits to the one that is too old and toothless to kill his own prey everything changes however when sheep are brutally killed in what seems from the toothmarks to be an attack from a giant beast

6828438 the results of our studies have clear implications for marketers managers and policymakers
6828439 it is worth noting that the normative messages which were messages that we have never seen utilized by hotel chains fared significantly better at spurring participation in the hotels environmental conservation program than did the type of message most commonly utilized by hotel chains messages that focus on the importance of environmental protection

6828441 arguably as the bigger more cost efficient stores move out the poor increasingly are likely to find themselves choosing between traveling farther to purchase nutritious competitively priced groceries or paying inflated prices for low quality processed foods at corner stores
6828442 stores pricing and location decisions in most instances are guided by competitive factors rather than any bias against the poor or their neighborhoods
6828443 one suggestion would be to explore the possibility of encouraging co operative stores which spreads the ownership among a relatively large group of stake holders within the poor community while at the same time increasing its operational economies of scale another possibility might be to consider joint ownership or management of franchises of selective stores in the poorest neighborhoods by the corporate owners of big grocery chains and poor residents
6828444 cost of being poor retail price and consumer price search differences across inner city and suburban neighborhoods
6828445 what we proposed 18 months ago would not fit the bill for what the air force is looking for

6828508 sgt shawn eades cpl dustin wasden and sapper stephan stock exemplify these values and were willing to sacrifice their lives to clear the road ahead for the people of afghanistan
6828509 his dedication to his soldiers and his mission was second to none this was his third tour in afghanistan and his reputation for succeeding at any task no matter how difficult was well known
6828510 the engineer corps held a special place in his heart he loved to fix things and help anyone complete their task his work made him happy and his enthusiasm was infectious to all those around him
6828511 his commitment to what was right and just inspired all those that had the privilege of knowing him he let his friends and family know his desire to serve in this mission may that be a comfort to all who mourn him
6828512 cpl wasden is a saskatchewan boy like myself grew up on a farm we always shared stories of the sasktachewan roughriders and farm work he liked to tell stories entertain his fellow soldiers
6828513 everyone that is here understands what our job is the risk associated with it and we prepare ourselves mentally for these eventualities and it makes you stronger
6828514 what id say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6828515 the difference is theyre not holding any of the ground that they attack us on so in the case of an ied strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road they inflicted the casualties on so really the net effect is zero other than it whittles away at our resolve
6828516 our soldiers believe in this mission they know what this is all about
6828517 we are pleased to see that the drivers all managed to gain a significant amount of track time without any particular problems for the tyres

6828529 catholic voters continue to support republican john mccain over democrat barack obama in the presidential race
6828530 mccain leads by nine percentage points in our two person head to head polling but there is still a significant slice who are yet undecided
6828531 catholic voters tell us they are more likely to be concerned about international issues than the average american voter and they also care more about social issues particularly abortion
6828532 mccains strength among catholic voters comes as russian troops moved into the republic of georgia and as he put in a strong straightforward performance at the saddleback civil forum in california
6828533 in that forum there was a clear distinction between mccain and obama on the question of when a human life begins and catholic voters may be responding warmly to mccains defense of his pro life stance at that forum
6828534 wright was so over the top they figured anyone nominated for president by a major political party couldnt possibly hold opinions that extreme

6828540 we hope he can visit china as soon as possible that would be good for the chinese catholic church however the first step is to establish diplomatic relations

6828637 our goal is an iraq that no longer needs american troops and i believe we can achieve that goal perhaps sooner than many imagine but i do not believe that anyone should make promises as a candidate for president that they cannot keep if elected
6828638 president bush is talking about our staying in iraq for 50 years
6828639 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed thats fine with me i hope it would be fine with you
6828640 im wondering when theyre going to stop advocating a date for withdrawal when we are succeeding in iraq
6828641 im wondering when theyre going to stop advocating a date for withdrawal when we are succeeding in iraq so i would work continuously with general david petraeus our other military leaders and make the decisions necessary to make sure we succeed and im convinced that the path that senator obama and senator clinton want to pursue would lead to disaster and defeat
6828642 to withdraw troops until we have the situation under control would be a disaster
6828643 most americans according to the polls have turned against the iraq war how do you read it
6828644 i read it that theres some understandable frustration there have been some mistakes made the job of people like me and the president and i intend to stay at it is to convince the american people of the benefits of success and the consequences of failure and to to withdraw troops until we have the situation under control would be a disaster
6828645 you have to make a decision as to whether youre going to pursue a path that can bring to about a stable iraq and freedom and dem for the people of iraq or youre going to have some kind of of situation where we either withdraw immediately or delay and

6828659 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
6828660 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
6828661 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
6828662 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
6828663 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
6828664 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time

6828668 i think they wanted the producers of this film the sort of sensibility which i had in the films titanic and shall we dance the sorts of scoring that i was doing in those movies which people are familiar in here in india so i think it wont be as big shock as some people thought it will be but yes it has a different approach
6828669 my association with three ladies actress in the film is very strange in the film this character mohanlals character in the film has got very strange ideas because he loves to make things very big he is renowned architect so its a passion and its a creation so this man lives in a different plane so he reacts with these ladies in different planes

6828676 we cannot stress too strongly that all children and young people should have the mmr vaccine overwhelming scientific evidence shows that it is safe

6828800 i come to this site everyday and at least 15 times a day i really do love your work and completely appreciate all the time you put in this web site
6828801 the day that never comes might be james singing about waiting for inspiration to write and record a great album this is a step above st anger in that its not completely a suck job but it is more of the mediocrity weve come to expect for tallica
6828802 if you want to hear something that sounds better than st anger go listen to a garbage disposal sucking down 40 pounds of rotten cabbage but seriously this really isnt that bad at times it sounds as if they are trying and sometimes trying to sic hard ill wait for the rest of the album to make any strict judgement sic calls

6828812 creemos que se deber an hacer pruebas regulares del adn de los pescados para asegurar que los consumidores se llevan lo que est n pagando y que las especies protegidas no est n siendo vendidas de forma ilegal

6828823 what were asking is for speaker pelosi to bring us back let us have a bipartisan energy bill under no circumstances should we go home if we do not have a bipartisan energy bill passed and signed by the president
6828824 its a myth we can replace the energy needs of today with the current alternatives we have to get there we want to get there but were not there yet
6828825 as your home heating bills go up as your gas prices skyrocket we are begging the democrat majority to have a vote on the american energy act we support alternatives we support research but we have got to do something to address more production
6828826 you your joys and your sorrows your memories and your ambitions your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules who you are is nothing but a pack of neurons
6828827 although we appear to have free will in fact our choices have already been predetermined for us and we cannot change that
6828828 omg if im just a pack of neurons i have much bigger things to worry about than behaving on this experiment

6828834 the answer is it was taken by one of hunters two sisters either roxanne or melissa
6828835 roxanne who lives in north carolina already has been identified as a source for previous enquirer stories she and rielle had not spoken for 15 years prior to the edwards scandal melissa on the other hand has so far been regarded as the loyal sister who would never sell out rielle for money

6828863 we asked israel not to sell offensive weapons to a hostile neighboring state but they said theyre a sovereign state
6828864 well israel shouldnt be surprised if we sell offensive weapons to israels neighbors
6828865 we told the israelis that this was a very unwise move and that russians were being killed because of georgias policy
6828866 they didnt take us seriously probably because they were encouraged by the united states

6828870 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
6828871 the fda would be stripped of an essential source of information that the agency has consistently relied on when making its regulatory decisions and the american public would be deprived of a vital deterrent against pharmaceutical company misconduct
6828872 the law in the devices case had a pre emption provision
6828873 congress has never put a pre emption provision in the
6828874 fda considers and approves specific labeling for a drug and the drug manufacturer is generally barred from making unilateral changes to the fda approved labeling
6828875 they wont let me protest then they sentence me to a year labour camp i am really mad
6828876 but we are not afraid we will go on protesting you can see this is not fair do you understand that
6828877 we never committed any crime when we were young now we are so old we cant even speak clearly how can we possible commit a crime
6828878 what crime they have the power so what they say counts we are just ordinary citizens and we have no voice we are victims
6828879 it becomes a win win situation for the children and family members of these offenders when they are able to maintain employment and provide monetary support to the family
6828880 were encouraging judges to keep them out of prison and to give our program a shot
6828881 they go to prison they do their six to eight months and they still owe child support when they get out
6828882 and then they end up being re indicted for nonsupport
6828883 having made a finding of physical incapacitation the trial court erred in finding that the respondent was voluntarily underemployed
6828884 in order to reduce his child support obligations voluntarily earns less than the parent is capable of earning
6828885 so the lawyer abandons his law practice and goes and takes a job at mcdonalds
6828886 is entitled to impute the income to you that you are capable of earning
6828887 shot himself in the face not because he wanted to become underemployed or wanted to circumvent child support obligations but rather because he wanted to take his own life as the trial court specifically found
6828888 income should be calculated in the 100 000 range to reflect the amount of money he uses to support his lifestyle

6828890 they should allow chaplains perhaps one from each country to be in the village this is important because for many of us athletics is not only physical and mental but spiritual
6828891 this is yet another example of iocs failure to enforce and to stand up to chinas efforts to roll back basic freedoms that have been taken for granted at previous olympics
6828892 we have kind of lost patience with it now we have been trying to be courteous and patient believing they would have adequate chaplains in there but they do not

6828900 as we seek to believe god like never before we will set an example for others to follow i never pictured myself as a leader until god revealed to me that like it or not people were watching and modeling my life
6828901 so youre laurie ann i talk to you on the phone all the time
6828902 the way to be a good leader is for your actions to be reflective of god reigning inside you but to be a great leader is for your reactions to be reflective of god reigning inside you did you catch that your reactions are key we can easily choose to act obediently to the lord and honor others in times of less stress
6828903 nothing will make god so real to you as seeing him change your character not change who you are your personality your strengths and your abilities but how you are your character
6828904 death brings about a new life that cant be found any other way indeed death does not mean defeat
6828905 the very things that feel like death are really a birth of something so much better
6828906 the children of israel were led by god not on the shortest route but rather the ordained route

6828922 if they are able to roll over their debt in late september and the dollar amount is substantial then it signals that the credit markets are comfortable enough with the current situation and with the government backstop and that buys them a fair amount of time
6828923 if that does not turn out well then the treasury if they have not already done so will at that point be forced to step in and act more quickly than they would have
6828924 nobody is going to put equity capital or preferred stock into fannie and freddie with whats the government going to do hanging over your head
6828925 if the government were to provide support that didnt wipe out shareholders you will have another year of bad quarters and it then starts getting better so theres a lot of upside potential

6828934 in retrospect i was wrong to partially sell the holdings

6828942 they have not slept in three hundred and eighty one years
6828943 i was born in the late 1400s the twins were born in the early 1500s
6828944 i was turned thirty years ago when i was thirty i am only sixty years old
6828945 i guess not but i never thought you two were old
6828946 even the twins im just a baby compared to you guys
6828947 zenaku is older than us my friend aidan is only a couple years older than myself
6828948 he helped shelter me and my family on my beginning years he is a very close ally of ours aidan has promised aid if zenaku tried to attack us
6828949 we should move our practice inside we could use the empty dining room

6828962 in an instant a confrontation can quickly turn into a life or death situation
6828963 well have a suspect with an edge weapon in his hand and well have an officer at the other cone what this drill does it simulates how fast a suspect can cover 21 feet
6828964 a dedicated individual can cover 21 feet in about a second and a half
6828965 which is about the same time it takes for an officer to unholster a weapon and bring it up to bear on the suspect
6828966 what the officers have to do is they have to evaluate the situation and react accordingly just because a suspect presents a knife doesnt mean its a cheap situation this 21 foot drill is not a cardinal rule that we shoot everybody within 21 feet its just an indicator for the officer to keep that suspect outside his danger zone
6828967 the store was the actual backdrop of the shooting location
6828968 if we miss that knife and we take that shot theres a lady and three kids in there buying a slurpy we cannot miss a small target
6828969 imagine you are so in love with this person and they are your everything but for whatever reason they dont believe it or maybe they just cant handle that much love and so you say to them

6828981 and what i learn today may be useful to me two years from now i mean if i understand the tar sands today and oil prices change or whatever may happen ive got that filed away and i can use it at some later date
6828982 because you could be the worlds greatest mining engineer but if you were wrong about the price of oil in a big way it would negate all that knowledge
6828983 so i can tell you that if you had 120 oil from now till you know 50 years from now that the tar sands would work out very well but i dont know the answer to that

6829093 its amazing how so few people knew that garmin gps and tom tom gps systems systems can have their standard voices so easily replaced of course we want pigtones to do for gps what ringtones did for cell phones

6829135 to pray and glorify allah as if you are in his presence as if you see him
6829136 o temporal flesh you resent listening to reason but listen are you sure as you inhale that this is not your last breath allah knows best but the next breath may be your last in this world to which you are so attached death will seize you by the throat yet you persist in piling wrong upon wrong sin upon sin the ultimate judge warns the ones who persist in sinning with such punishment that mountains of rock cannot bear it how then can you flimsy as a straw imagine that you could bear such horrible torments do not turn your back on me one who created you face him and repent do it now without delay for you do not know when death will break you in two
6829137 indeed after the aura of death has rendered you prostrate and life is fading away if you can remember at all and repent that repentance will not be accepted by allah the prophet whom he sent as a mercy upon the universe said that though allah accepts your repentance until the time when your breath is being choked out of you at the moment of your death throes it is too late death comes without warning to some while eating to some while drinking to others while sleeping with their wives to others in deep sleep from which they do not awake whoever before that has not turned from falsehood to truth has not repented but persists in sinning will fall into the abyss of death
6829138 i take refuge in your pleasure in your beauty in your gentleness from your wrath and your strength i take refuge in your divine mercy and compassion from your punishment i take refuge in you from you
6829139 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6829140 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
6829141 my relationship with the church of god has been broadened and deepened
6829142 catholics who attempt to confer a sacred order on a woman and the women who attempt to receive a sacred order are by their own actions separating themselves from the church
6829143 all people are created by god equal in that we each possess an immortal and individual soul but we are each unique in our talents women are called upon to be mothers spiritually and for many in marriage physically as well whereas men are called upon to be fathers spiritually and for many in marriage physically as well
6829144 we can have a special election i prefer to put it on this ballot but you always have to go for the next best thing you cant always have it exactly your way
6829145 im optimistic that we will pass a budget in time for this election
6829146 willing to stay as long as it takes to get the right responsible kind of budget for california
6829147 i think we all could very quickly be on the same page if i would want to fix the budget problem only for this year and kick the problem down to next year but is that what i want no
6829148 republicans in the legislature have no interest in thinking long term
6829149 heres a chance to go to the democrats and say look youve never been for budget reform why dont you give us budget reform and in exchange we do a temporary sales tax increase it could work
6829150 when you travel around the world you see the rest of the world building building and building and cranes everywhere i want to see that in california rather than mickey mousing around with all this nonsense and arguing about the budget
6829151 we can have a budget system in place so that we dont have to argue about the budget all the time then debate about the big things
6829152 the incident seems to be meeting same the criteria but were not sure if its the same group as suspected in previous robberies
6829153 as with any crime the first priority is safety and to report it immediately
6829154 today i am calling on investors and organisations around the world to come forward and surprise us with startling ideas that can preserve the memory of the games while creating a new focus for londons eastward growth
6829155 add to the buzz that the 2012 games is already generating and to underpin the areas growing prosperity and development

6829157 we are very pleased to welcome benoit into our organization
6829158 he has done a very good job in developing a winning program in gatineau and he has also experienced great success for team canada at the international level
6829159 benoit is a coach that is respected throughout hockey for his ability to get the most out of his players
6829160 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6829161 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6829162 obama has a lot of work to do to attract clinton supporters if he doesnt choose her as his running mate
6829163 the vice presidential choice will make a big difference in the election
6829164 how in the world can they do this to me under the clear blue sky under the guise that theyre protecting me
6829165 its a lifesaver and a life stopper its an institution that we as a society need but we need to make it better
6829166 often in the eyes of the court being old and spending money foolishly
6829167 this constitutes a significant portion of the cases out there they were flat out rip off situations
6829168 we expected to see signs all around the next morning
6829169 when you walked in the door the house had an odor to it
6829170 you couldnt eat on the kitchen table for all the clutter the room that i stayed in you had to make a path to the sofa bed there were boxes in front of the heating registers
6829171 adult protective services came in like a bull in a china shop
6829172 the presumption was that because mrs carr was in her 90s she couldnt possibly be competent
6829173 i found her to be very confused and unable to track her money
6829174 she has the ability to maintain a superficial fa ade of functionality however there are underlying impairments
6829175 he and his wife essentially cleared out his mothers checking and savings accounts
6829176 she was left destitute and is currently in a nursing home penniless
6829177 i could be a shoe salesman at a five and dime store yesterday and a professional conservator or guardian today
6829178 the place stunk and some of the residents would try to sexually go after her
6829179 started crying and said get me out of here she felt like she had been thrown into a jail practically and forgotten about
6829180 you can have all the reports in the world but if there is no assurance that someone is reading them it is not doing any good
6829181 someone can be falsifying a report if they do not think its being monitored and for the ward the very system that is supposed to be protecting them ends up abusing them
6829182 my aunt and uncle pretty much lost control of their finances and home and everything else
6829183 carry out the wishes preferences and values of the ward
6829184 theyre not supposed to play god theyre not supposed to impose their wishes or preferences on the individual
6829185 although she is very lucid and articulate in the context of conversation mrs carr exhibits her shortcomings in the way she functions in her everyday life how she maintains her house and how she manages her paperwork
6829186 ms carr is competent and has the capacity to make meaningful decisions about her personal needs and the management of her financial resources ms carr is competent and has the ability to resist fraud and or undue influence ms carr does not need a conservator
6829187 the court is trying to err on the side of protecting people and being more open to granting conservatorships in questionable cases
6829188 some psychologists will tell you just what you want to hear
6829189 the good news is that the court made every effort to protect her
6829190 here we worked and saved this money and then someone comes in and takes it away from you
6829191 this is something that ought not to be taken lightly
6829192 seniors have become victims of the legal process when you become old you should not by the action of a court automatically lose your rights just because some family member or impersonal administrator calls you incompetent

6829206 i feel pretty stupid that i didnt check out exactly how much i was paying
6829207 next time im going to be more careful about where i use my credit card where i use my cash
6829208 with summer gas prices reaching an all time high the last thing long island drivers need are gas stations hitting them with exorbitant prices for paying with a credit card
6829209 one plausible explanation is that given the relative geographic isolation of nassau and suffolk residents would be forced to drive longer distances to find cheaper gas prices which means there is less pressure to keep the market honest

6829211 in pennsylvania hillary clintons influence will be critical clinton beat obama handily in the pennsylvania primary and she remains popular among pennsylvanians although democratic candidates have done well in pennsylvania in recent years john mccain is likely to have more appeal here than did george w bush
6829212 citizen journalists blogger and video bloggers will play a big part in this political season because their messages can be targeted to specific groups and because mainstream media organizations due to financial constraints will be focused more on the horserace aspect of the presidential race
6829213 the economy has become an even bigger issue than the war in iraq which is good for both mccain and obama because neither seems to have a good plan for getting us out of the war
6829214 this group seems to break more toward obama but because its an unstable demographic he has to make sure that it comes out in force
6829215 historically speaking the 2008 campaign strikes me as remarkably similar to the jfk nixon campaign of 1960 said hilty
6829216 nixon for eight years eisenhowers vice president had to defend the status quo and the eisenhower record mccain by contrast must both defend and deny the bush record both nixon and mccain are products of the republican mainstream

6829218 she has not regained her speech i thought he planned to let his silly bounty hunters attempt to take her
6829219 i beat the crap out of him at marys old home
6829220 i would expect no less i am unsure of my vision i fear he is growing impatient my dear friend aidan is slightly worried about zenaku and his desire for mary
6829221 he has even offered to aid us if a real battle should commence
6829222 well i guess i should give the man some credit
6829223 i hope i can get him to come visit with me
6829224 he too is one born of zenaku the two of us are like brothers
6829225 thank heavens you found me instead of him i would have killed him already just keep mary far from him if he does plan a visit
6829226 zenaku found him on one of his world trips diana wished to travel to africa one winter and they came across julai julai has the ability to form blades from his skin and nails i hear he can also make use of his hair if desired
6829227 you will need it when you fight julai ken and i will handle aaron
6829228 i hear the boy can teleport the female he was with called it phasing aaron said i was too fast for him
6829229 with my sight and i see when and where he will appear next then ken can handle the battle from there
6829230 i have been searching marys line her fate travels in so many different directions there is no real way for me to pinpoint if she really gains her voice or not the woman astounds me she is the hardest of our kind for me to follow i wish i knew why
6829231 that is why we must protect her i will be damned if my coven be broken no matter the size this home is mine my members are
6829232 it is the right of every coven father or mother
6829233 i do hope you mean the year you were turned my friend the year is 1897 i was born in 1493
6829234 i have a good sixty seven years lead kami i was turned at twenty two years of age
6829235 a leader of our type of coven are either called the father or the mother it is my duty to protect my family understand
6829236 now we have to figure out why zenaku is making such a move do you think he is only planning on giving another message
6829237 thats the first time my heart has beat in four hundred and four years
6829238 i did not know it just came i was picturing myself being trapped by zenaku at first nothing then i commanded it to release then the twins fell and ken trampled the keys
6829239 thats all they were doing when you two were gone
6829240 ken believes its impossible to have multiple gifts no other vampire has more than one kyle thought mary would be too sweet to command anything so he thought that ability was ruled out
6829241 i will treat myself to something then actually i will reward mary for such a victory is there anything i can get for you mary i will buy you whatever you desire
6829242 all i want is to stay here with you guys i want to stay in this coven
6829243 i am full of such joy i will think of something else to treat you with mary i must buy you something we must celebrate
6829244 we have other matters to attend to before we can have a party
6829245 patients kami ken and i must discuss a certain matter
6829246 because you will not return if you leave with her
6829247 i am going to need your help in handling aaron kami will take care of julai his katana is the only blade capable of competing with him
6829248 i believe zenaku may be giving them their order as we speak
6829249 they will not attack during daylight even though they are near central china they can make it here easily by tomorrow night

6829265 health care half truths too many myths not enough reality
6829266 the key is how much is the break its no good if anyone has to come up with more than 5 percent of their income or if they buy insurance that when you read the fine print actually barely covers a doctor visit and no tests more than seven in 10 people who are uninsured work and continue to work and so the ability to be covered between jobs is vital automobile accidents dont just occur when people are working
6829267 the problem with our health care system isnt that we have too much or too little competition but that we have the wrong kind of competition
6829268 the structure of health care delivery has to change consumer driven health care wont work
6829269 the googlization of everything how one company is disrupting culture commerce and community and why we should worry
6829270 its like nails on a chalkboard when i hear that
6829271 i love to visit minneapolis but theres something about st paul thats charming and simple
6829272 it is you can hardly go anywhere in st paul that you dont see someone you know which is the great thing about it i think
6829273 if you were one of these guys when you got to town youd literally walk up to the first police officer you saw and introduce yourself
6829274 you would have to promise you would not commit a crime in the city limits of st paul you could kill anyone you wanted in minneapolis and you did

6829277 im all for federal funding of faith based partnerships when the money is given to established social service agencies that can then partner with local congregations
6829278 small churches cant handle the incredible amount of groundwork that needs to be done in order to provide community services
6829279 run counter to the thinking of the bush faith based initiative the core of which obama would build on we found that the community is the place where everything must center and that mainline community organizations like the united way not small start up organizations are better suited to address multi faceted community problems
6829280 our research goal is to help community leaders match resources to needs
6829281 these findings mirror emerging research elsewhere and the ones i uncovered in greensboro in the 1990s delaware is not an anomaly a new initiative could use federal dollars to help community stewards strengthen existing partnerships and build new ones

6829287 even if we pull all of our troops out of the country which doesnt seem likely in two years american voters want someone with a plan for iraq as well as the economy health care and other hot button issues
6829288 americans dont trust their government or political system cynicism about the motives and interests of our politicians is so deep that voters find themselves in an immobilizing contradiction

6829314 the real issue relevant to this election should not be whether the surge has worked it should be the cost or more accurately the opportunity cost that the prosecution of the war requires because the united states government is spending approximately 10 billion a month prosecuting the war in iraq the country goes into deeper and deeper debt funds are therefore not available for desperately needed improvements to the nations infrastructure investments in research on alternative sources of energy fixing the social security system expanding access to health insurance and in other ways promoting the expansion of the middle class
6829315 the 2008 democratic primary can be contrasted with the 1984 democratic primary in 1984 frontrunner walter mondale staved off gary hart and jesse jackson by winning the old line new deal democratic voters union members catholics hispanics rural voters and white working class voters in cities hart won college campuses affluent yuppies and environmentalists roughly the mcgovern ite coalition or the new left that evolved out of the vietnam and civil rights protests of the 1960s jacksons base was african americans in 2008 frontrunner hillary clinton recreated mondales coalition but obama was able to combine the hart and jackson constituencies and defeat her in the general election those people in the clinton camp a bigger universe now that its no longer restricted to registered or self identified democrats will be decisive mccain though a republican appeals to these voters obama will have to hold his own among this demographic to win the battleground regions will be the midwest and the southwest ohio is probably the biggest prize again but pennsylvania michigan missouri colorado and virginia are big states that will be closely contested as well
6829316 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6829317 it is important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order
6829318 its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
6829319 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
6829320 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
6829321 both war and peace are in the hands of israeli jews
6829322 gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6829323 we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones that have been approved have been duly scrutinized
6829324 elles nont jamais t ensemble cest une strat gie pour faire parler delles
6829325 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6829326 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6829327 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6829328 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6829329 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6829330 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6829331 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6829332 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6829333 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6829334 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6829335 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6829336 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6829337 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6829338 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6829339 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6829340 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6829341 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6829342 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6829343 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits

6829345 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6829346 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6829347 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6829348 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6829349 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

6829362 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6829363 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6829364 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

6829368 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6829369 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6829370 i can hear it calling you now coming now drowning swimming closer to you
6829371 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6829372 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6829373 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6829374 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6829375 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6829376 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6829377 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6829378 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6829379 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6829380 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6829381 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6829382 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6829383 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6829384 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6829385 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6829386 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6829387 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6829388 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6829389 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6829390 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6829391 who are open to doing something on the production side
6829392 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6829393 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6829394 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6829395 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6829396 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6829397 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

6829405 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6829406 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6829407 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6829408 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6829409 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6829410 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6829411 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6829412 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6829413 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6829414 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6829415 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6829416 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6829417 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6829418 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6829419 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6829420 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6829421 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6829422 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6829423 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6829424 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6829425 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6829456 we are headed into a time when a confluence of changes are going to lead to a perfect storm making us finally realize that our health care system needs a major overhaul
6829457 as the elderly population doubles between now and about 2030 projections are that we will see at least a doubling of the costs of the federal and state health and retirement programs
6829458 that will likely be when the perfect storm hits but if we miss it then we will likely have missed all the storm clouds for the foreseeable future
6829459 while attention focuses on these two major trends other storm clouds are brewing
6829460 a long term care crisis looms grows and receives little attention despite problems with the affordability quality and access to long term care these problems will only become much worse as the aging population doubles by 2030
6829461 much attention also has been paid to the problems of financing social security but the financial problems of the social security program pale in comparison to the burden of the medicare and medicaid programs on our economy
6829462 there are already shortages of nurses and open nursing positions are sometimes filled by the expensive practice of recruiting migrant nurses into communities
6829463 added to this problem now are reports of shortages of other health professionals including therapists social workers health aides and even some categories of physicians
6829464 overall we continue to worry about the general quality of health care as well as the problems of health disparities as the inequities of our economy and culture flow into the health care system
6829465 republicans are all about supply side energy democrats are more about affecting the demand side
6829466 im not sure mccain has a good grasp of cap and trade or renewables complexities
6829467 and obama is throwing a lot of stuff out there but hasnt really set any priorities
6829468 what kind of power does the u s really have and how should it be used
6829469 senator mccain would have the u s wield more hard power acting with muscle and military force and alone if necessary
6829470 senator obama would have the u s wield the softer power of diplomacy and multilateralism acting as first among equals with u s allies in the world this difference in views is stark and has consequences for americans and american security and for the security of people well beyond u s borders
6829471 mccain looks at the world through the lens of the vietnam war and says if only we had applied more hard power longer and more consistently we would have won this is a more straight forward position but not one that works across the board
6829472 obama looks at the world through the lens of post vietnam and says we have to use different kinds of power in different circumstances because military force doesnt always work to secure our interests this is a more nuanced position but more difficult to practice
6829473 this location speaks to the new look of the democratic push which hopes to appeal to the residents of western states regain support from the ethnic working class win over faith based voters reassure the middle class and hold on to the traditional democratic faithful among minorities women and others
6829474 its obamas show to be sure but the clintons will be there they must be there to acknowledge the support of those who stood up for hillary rodham clinton in her bid for the presidency and to stand with obama in the partys call for unity and the argument for common purpose
6829475 although recent nominating conventions have been more confection than consequence this one commands attention because of its history making elements and obamas charisma people will want to see what all of the fuss is about
6829476 and this most american of events the nominating convention will provide the setting and opportunity to show that obama and the democrats are indeed all american thats their strategy and their task in the wake of the flag waving and national fervor of the olympic games they should do no less
6829477 very soon within the gears of war 2 launch timeframe

6829490 minor political parties inability to gain traction in the united states does not reflect natural facets of our national character
6829491 rather our legal system imposes formidable barriers to minor parties electoral viability the use of plurality voting the candidate with the most votes gets the only prize and single member districts in congressional and most state legislative elections drives voters to coalesce around only two electoral options marginalizing any candidate who lacks a major party brand a better fairer structure of political competition would give minor parties a legislative platform and a chance to supplant one of the major parties
6829492 first amendment constraints on campaign finance regulation under which government may substantially restrict the amounts of political contributions but not of campaign expenditures ensures that only the democrats and republicans with their broad bases of financial support can compete effectively
6829493 in addition federal regulators do not require broadcasters to provide equal time to minor party candidates
6829494 the legal entrenchment of the two major parties has solidified a centrist political order
6829495 proponents of bipartisanship insist that our political culture lacks moderation the polarization of democratic and republican elites has forced the sensible center from its rightful position of political dominance
6829496 denied the keys to government minor parties can take intellectual and rhetorical chances
6829497 they can operate as policy laboratories developing proposals that may attract few initial adherents but eventually penetrate the core of political consciousness the progressive party exemplified this function at the turn of the last century agitating for minimum wages graduated income taxation and numerous other social economic and political reforms that eventually became cornerstones of our law

6829501 the key problem for democratic candidates advocating the withdrawal of american troops from iraq is that troop withdrawals that come without declarations of victory or success will be perceived as acknowledgments of failure

6829554 that wears me down some days and lifts me up on others it wasnt my first plan to have five kids and be a stay at home mom i was going to be a college professor with two children im grateful for my plan b though its taught me more and given me more joy than i could have ever hoped for

6829562 created paperwork to make it appear that he had made the calls
6829563 we have had several discussions about contacting witnesses i would like to see more documentation
6829564 it all depends upon the discussions i will be having with senior upa leaders
6829565 i am yet to get any information regarding any such move
6829566 you may have seen that there was an announcement that the game was delayed john riccitiello mentioned that in the recent earnings call actually were in the closed beta already so the game is already out and you cant delay a game thats already been released and already been played by people
6829567 its an interesting difference between a packaged goods product like our previous battlefield games in that there is no real kind of big splash release date where suddenly its available it kind of builds up over time the game will kind of sneak out and before you know it it will be a fairly big game even though were in the closed beta and were not released
6829568 were asking for a do over because all of those tf2 updates are really stealing the steam from our release news

6829572 e dward theres something that i want to do before im not human anymore
6829573 t ell me what you want and you can have it bella
6829574 leta 1778 ko se je zgodil ta visokogorski alpinisti ni podvig kot bi ga poimenovali danes je to pomenilo pomemben pomnik na podro ju gorskega raziskovanja in osvajanja e neosvojenih gora oziroma vrhov
6829575 slovenci v zgodovini ve inoma nismo bili zamudniki in zaradi tega se tudi danes lahko s ponosom uvr amo v neko razvojno jedro eu in lahko za prihodnost ra unamo e na vi ja mesta
6829576 le malokje lahko sre amo toliko ljudi na planinskih poteh kot ravno pri nas
6829577 vendar pa je tam lep i razgled in zagotovo je tak napor popla an
6829578 planinstvo oziroma gorni tvo pa skozi zgodovino e zdale ni bilo samo portna dejavnost
6829579 triglav v vsej mogo nosti e vedno bolj ostaja gospodar zemlje zraka in morja torej tudi ivljenja in upanja predvsem pa nam je triglav vedno bolj kot svetinja in v najve ji popolnosti simbol slovenstva
6829580 ti mo je najbolj neposredno sporo ajo nam in svetu o mogo nosti trdnosti in pomembnosti gorskih dejanj v preteklosti in sedanjosti slovenskega planinstva alpinizma gorni tva
6829581 ta slovenski zgodovinski planinski spomin si zagotovo zaslu i obele itev saj je tradicija bogata in vesel sem da bomo kmalu dobili slovenski planinski muzej kjer bo ta bogata dedi ina ustrezno predstavljena tudi mlaj im generacijam in gostom ki slovenijo obi ejo
6829582 around the corner they moved them because they are bringing the ones from the berkeley office but you werent over there so you dont have one
6829583 so go get one and take which ever one you desire most
6829584 yeah well its broken too the back wont stay up
6829585 wow you got an aero chair better hang onto that one
6829586 my biggest concern on the stock is that i think expectations are too high for medium term profitability
6829587 i came to have a look at new technologies i like the flat screen tvs and the cell phones with mp3 players but i am just looking not really shopping
6829588 what we failed to take into account frankly is that you would have great angst over the fact we made that announcement and didnt confirm
6829589 it was very helpful for the company to make this statement today
6829590 we think prices should be the same we think anybody in europe should buy off any store
6829591 also fliege ich durch das tal des todes und ich soll das b se nicht f rchten denn ich bin auf 80 000 fu und steige weiter
6829592 they just realized maybe it was sending the wrong message and took it down themselves
6829593 this is a great device this kind of device cannot be produced by japanese manufacturers never
6829594 to do that clear direction clear vision clear leadership are necessary
6829595 one being a growing interest in advertising plays that capitalize on indias emerging infrastructure and growing internet usage the other being an increase in second round deals
6829596 if home prices were going up and you could hold on to a house for a long time you might be able to make a case that its a better time to buy
6829597 but if you have the ability to rent for half the price without the liabilities that go with owning its a smarter decision to rent
6829598 people feel nervous about trying to time the bottom of the housing market but they dont need to feel that urgency
6829599 a year from now they can come back to the market and theyre not going to lose anything
6829600 if you think youre at all in harms way you shouldnt be in the second home market
6829601 it doesnt matter how affordable a house is if you dont have any income
6829602 i dont think the market will turn around quickly there are probably great deals on yachts right now too but not everybody can buy them
6829603 with values declining its difficult for many to make the leap and purchase a property with the concern that they will lose equity
6829604 but at the same time the suburban product whether its single family homes or condos are at price points where its difficult to construct them at those levels
6829605 it makes no fiscal sense whatsoever to buy a second home it barely makes fiscal sense to buy a first home
6829606 if you rent you know what the costs are if something breaks its somebody elses headache its a vacation
6829607 a visit to the u s by chief minister modi will provide tacit approval of his reprehensible statements policies and actions
6829608 i respectfully request your leadership in publicly condemning his actions and policies by once again denying chief minister narendra modi the right to enter this country
6829609 mr modi has not accepted any invitation to speak anywhere and all of this is a way for ngos all over the world to become famous by insulting him
6829610 narendraji modi has made only one thing clear he will not go to any place where gujarat is being insulted
6829611 the victory of 2007 is a reaffirmation of the peoples faith in his leadership statesmanship and governance which he displayed in last six years as chief minister
6829612 modis model of good governance is being applauded within the country and beyond
6829613 increasing broadcasting revenue has been the major reason for the leagues success
6829614 the time works out great for asia which is by far the largest potential market compared with africa and the americas
6829615 i believe the olympics will make china more open more transparent more tolerant and more confident
6829616 the chinese government has become more confident because of a successful olympics that helps the liberal wing of the leaders they will argue that we should not be so scared of the international media and international integration and also to a certain extent openness or transparency
6829617 after the olympics the reform effort that has been stalled by the pressures of hosting a major international event could be restarted
6829618 if those freedoms can be extended to chinese journalists that could be one of the positive results of the games
6829619 im disappointed but not surprised by the not very substantial measures that the chinese took to remain in line with their commitments for the olympic games
6829620 china was trying to send a message to the outside world that it was willing to take measures to open up but internally the main concern was preserving stability and i dont think that after the games that will change so much
6829621 theyll keep most of the things in place certainly the harassment of the dissidents and we wont see any kind of greater move towards liberalization or opening up or anything like that
6829622 did this change chinas view in the world is this a turning point no it will just reinforce your sense of a party thats completely insecure and lacking a great deal of confidence
6829623 were in the lead not only in india but in the whole world in delivering health care for the poor
6829624 i have no doubt that this will be a model for the rest of the world

6829720 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6829721 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6829722 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6829723 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6829724 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6829725 the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6829726 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6829727 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6829728 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6829729 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6829730 nist said that wtc 7 fell at 40 slower than free fall speed but it collapsed a lot faster than it would have if the structural supports were not all blown away at the same instant 40 slower isnt very impressive thats like arguing that a rock falling through concrete 40 slower than a rock falling through the air is perfectly normal

6829735 so saint christopher was actually pretty close then because you found it in the car
6829736 we could win the gold medal in every single track and field event but if we dont win a single thing in the sprints and relays the public will view our performance as a disaster
6829737 when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster
6829738 we can be a much better team and we will be
6829739 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs it will include assessments from inside and outside the usatf family
6829740 included in the assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6829741 they all say more or less the same thing the dropped batons were reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership i agree
6829742 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes
6829743 ultimately the athletes on the track are the only ones who can successfully pass the stick around the track but they need proper leadership and preparation
6829744 theres no denying we have had more than our share of bad luck
6829745 the public sometimes sees these things and sees only failure rather than the nature of the games
6829746 when the mens marathon concludes on sunday well still be the worlds number one team in terms of medal count
6829747 in the mens and womens 200 im not sure there was any stopping the jamaican juggernaut at least not when it comes to gold medals
6829748 nobody from any country was going to beat 9 69 and 19 30
6829749 we wont have nearly as many gold medals as weve won the last two world championships and gold is what gets it done
6829750 the perception is that weve managed to muck up several key events some people have taken that key event letdown and applied it somewhat unfairly to the entire team

6829763 we knew one of our goals of the schedule was to host the state farm tip off classic
6829764 we feel privileged and excited to be welcoming three great teams to the maravich center to open the college basketball season notre dame will give our team a chance to play against an outstanding opponent right away
6829765 when i came to lsu one of our goals was to renew our rivalry with louisiana tech

6829781 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs it will include assessments from inside and outside the usatf family
6829782 included in the assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6829783 they all say more or less the same thing the dropped batons were reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership i agree
6829784 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes
6829785 ultimately the athletes on the track are the only ones who can successfully pass the stick around the track but they need proper leadership and preparation
6829786 theres no denying we have had more than our share of bad luck
6829787 the public sometimes sees these things and sees only failure rather than the nature of the games
6829788 when the mens marathon concludes on sunday well still be the worlds number one team in terms of medal count
6829789 in the mens and womens 200 im not sure there was any stopping the jamaican juggernaut at least not when it comes to gold medals
6829790 nobody from any country was going to beat 9 69 and 19 30
6829791 we wont have nearly as many gold medals as weve won the last two world championships and gold is what gets it done
6829792 the perception is that weve managed to muck up several key events some people have taken that key event letdown and applied it somewhat unfairly to the entire team
6829793 richard is the kind of student athlete who embodies everything that is great about being at lsu competing in the sport of track and field
6829794 he is one of the hardest workers and one of the easiest athletes to coach that ive ever worked with and i have no doubt that his future is very bright in this sport hes a true champion in every sense of the word
6829795 he will now begin a new chapter in his life and i cant think of a better way for him to start than with the kind of performance he had this week at the olympic games its truly remarkable
6829796 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6829797 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6829798 i was exhausted to keep plugging away and not fall off it was tough
6829799 cuba are a great team with some great players they hit our pitching mistakes they hit them over the fence

6829814 i dont have any inkling myself at all but obviously sung kim is going to assess where things are with north korea in his conversations with north korean officials
6829815 the us government wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting
6829816 we found that early life infections recurrent otitis having a dog as a newborn and growing up in a larger family was independent of each other and independent of other confounders related to snoring in adulthood
6829817 this is a very general study based on a questionnaire that simply was distributed to a large number of subjects you could find statistical significance however the meaning of this significance to the clinical arena is unclear
6829818 we speculate that all these factors could promote an enlargening of tonsils with mouth breathing and a subsequent change of the mandibular growth that could promote snoring in adulthood
6829819 four countries have now decided against coming to pakistan i probably shouldnt bracket the other three england australia and new zealand with south africa as they have yet to announce their decisions but from what we are hearing they will probably do the same

6829899 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
6829900 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
6829901 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
6829902 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
6829903 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
6829904 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world

6829922 negou se a abrir a cova porque dizia que n o havia tempo de abrir e de revestir a campa ou seja meter blocos de cimento nas paredes laterais e frontais
6829923 foi contactado pela fam lia cerca das 8 30h 9h da manh
6829924 o coveiro atendeu e disse que n o tinha tempo de abrir a cova e colocar os blocos de cimento
6829925 a resposta do presidente da junta foi n o tenho mais ningu m por isso tens de fazer eu voltei resposta abro a cova e n o tenho qualquer problema nisso
6829926 se a falecida tem a campa h cerca de 32 anos porque motivo se vai comprar outra para se meter o corpo eu abro a cova foi isso que aconteceu
6829927 o presidente da junta mandou buscar os carros de m o eu comecei a cavar e o meu sobrinho a levar a terra para longe
6829928 n s abrimos a cova e ele colocou os tijolos
6829929 s l estava um corpo e naquela altura n o se revestiam as campas

6829931 o coveiro efectuou todos os trabalhos com ajuda de familiares conforme tinha sido acordado j que o tempo dispon vel era insuficiente para o que a fam lia da falecida pretendia afundar a campa e revesti la
6829932 sempre foram resolvidas em colabora o entre a junta e as fam lias

6829939 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6829940 and there are only so many to win if theyre winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did

6829946 si dovrebbe assimilare i colori della vita ma non ricordarne i particolari
6829947 a divider not a uniter george w bush and the american people the 2006 election and beyond
6829948 in pennsylvania hillary clintons influence will be critical clinton beat obama handily in the pennsylvania primary and she remains popular among pennsylvanians although democratic candidates have done well in pennsylvania in recent years john mccain is likely to have more appeal here than did george w bush
6829949 citizen journalists blogger and video bloggers will play a big part in this political season because their messages can be targeted to specific groups and because mainstream media organizations due to financial constraints will be focused more on the horserace aspect of the presidential race
6829950 the economy has become an even bigger issue than the war in iraq which is good for both mccain and obama because neither seems to have a good plan for getting us out of the war
6829951 this group seems to break more toward obama but because its an unstable demographic he has to make sure that it comes out in force
6829952 historically speaking the 2008 campaign strikes me as remarkably similar to the jfk nixon campaign of 1960 said hilty
6829953 nixon for eight years eisenhowers vice president had to defend the status quo and the eisenhower record mccain by contrast must both defend and deny the bush record both nixon and mccain are products of the republican mainstream
6829954 research finds campaigns may be leaving some votes on the table
6829955 in a my campaign era wedge issues trump national interests
6829956 im all for federal funding of faith based partnerships when the money is given to established social service agencies that can then partner with local congregations
6829957 small churches cant handle the incredible amount of groundwork that needs to be done in order to provide community services
6829958 run counter to the thinking of the bush faith based initiative the core of which obama would build on we found that the community is the place where everything must center and that mainline community organizations like the united way not small start up organizations are better suited to address multi faceted community problems
6829959 our research goal is to help community leaders match resources to needs
6829960 these findings mirror emerging research elsewhere and the ones i uncovered in greensboro in the 1990s delaware is not an anomaly a new initiative could use federal dollars to help community stewards strengthen existing partnerships and build new ones
6829961 gesture and other forms of visual communication are tightly integrated with our understanding of language
6829962 gesture may represent one of the earliest forms of communication in the evolution of language
6829963 president clintons eventual admission of his white house affair with monica lewinsky helped change the political landscape
6829964 at the time of the 1968 elections for example the vietnam war had become a liability for vice president and presidential candidate hubert humphrey he was seen as being saddled with the war
6829965 richard nixon came in with a roadmap for the area and he was elected
6829966 even if we pull all of our troops out of the country which doesnt seem likely in two years american voters want someone with a plan for iraq as well as the economy health care and other hot button issues
6829967 americans dont trust their government or political system cynicism about the motives and interests of our politicians is so deep that voters find themselves in an immobilizing contradiction
6829968 some students anticipate that the class will be simply a discussion of what the national media reported that morning
6829969 we will certainly discuss daily campaign news when appropriate but only when it speaks to larger questions about the current races and how elections in general work
6829970 both of them are analytical thinkers who ask more thoughtful questions than the typical ones we hear on the pundit talk shows
6829971 many will enroll in the course as strong republican or democratic partisans and they will not understand what it is like to win or lose a political race
6829972 we will emphasize that the american political process never really has closure there are going to be some years when your party does great and some when your party loses thats what american politics is all about
6829973 no child left behind views about the potential impact of the bush administrations education proposals

6829975 the politics to go handbook a guide to using mobile technology in politics and the political consultants online fundraising primer
6829976 what kind of power does the u s really have and how should it be used
6829977 senator mccain would have the u s wield more hard power acting with muscle and military force and alone if necessary
6829978 senator obama would have the u s wield the softer power of diplomacy and multilateralism acting as first among equals with u s allies in the world this difference in views is stark and has consequences for americans and american security and for the security of people well beyond u s borders
6829979 mccain looks at the world through the lens of the vietnam war and says if only we had applied more hard power longer and more consistently we would have won this is a more straight forward position but not one that works across the board
6829980 obama looks at the world through the lens of post vietnam and says we have to use different kinds of power in different circumstances because military force doesnt always work to secure our interests this is a more nuanced position but more difficult to practice
6829981 the real issue relevant to this election should not be whether the surge has worked it should be the cost or more accurately the opportunity cost that the prosecution of the war requires because the united states government is spending approximately 10 billion a month prosecuting the war in iraq the country goes into deeper and deeper debt funds are therefore not available for desperately needed improvements to the nations infrastructure investments in research on alternative sources of energy fixing the social security system expanding access to health insurance and in other ways promoting the expansion of the middle class
6829982 the 2008 democratic primary can be contrasted with the 1984 democratic primary in 1984 frontrunner walter mondale staved off gary hart and jesse jackson by winning the old line new deal democratic voters union members catholics hispanics rural voters and white working class voters in cities hart won college campuses affluent yuppies and environmentalists roughly the mcgovern ite coalition or the new left that evolved out of the vietnam and civil rights protests of the 1960s jacksons base was african americans in 2008 frontrunner hillary clinton recreated mondales coalition but obama was able to combine the hart and jackson constituencies and defeat her in the general election those people in the clinton camp a bigger universe now that its no longer restricted to registered or self identified democrats will be decisive mccain though a republican appeals to these voters obama will have to hold his own among this demographic to win the battleground regions will be the midwest and the southwest ohio is probably the biggest prize again but pennsylvania michigan missouri colorado and virginia are big states that will be closely contested as well
6829983 avoid letting your political enthusiasm turn you into a verbal bully
6829984 beware of your actions in the face of others discontent too much jubilance too much emphasis on victory may cost you a friend
6829985 choose to discuss subjects that are safe and unlikely to create tension
6829986 that will smooth the transition back into a friends life
6829987 term limits are not only good for elected officials but also for celebrating what can be interpreted as your friends loss
6829988 friendships after all are designed to last longer than elected officials
6829989 this location speaks to the new look of the democratic push which hopes to appeal to the residents of western states regain support from the ethnic working class win over faith based voters reassure the middle class and hold on to the traditional democratic faithful among minorities women and others
6829990 its obamas show to be sure but the clintons will be there they must be there to acknowledge the support of those who stood up for hillary rodham clinton in her bid for the presidency and to stand with obama in the partys call for unity and the argument for common purpose
6829991 although recent nominating conventions have been more confection than consequence this one commands attention because of its history making elements and obamas charisma people will want to see what all of the fuss is about
6829992 and this most american of events the nominating convention will provide the setting and opportunity to show that obama and the democrats are indeed all american thats their strategy and their task in the wake of the flag waving and national fervor of the olympic games they should do no less
6829993 elderly voters especially elderly voters who live in long term care settings are at the mercy of others when it comes to exercising their right to vote
6829994 the path we have followed to improve this communitys health crosses ethnic lines and geographic boundaries
6829995 we hope that our work in south philadelphia will guide the u s healthcare system towards a more equitable and effective future that ultimately ensures the wellness of all americans
6829996 its almost the perfect storm when people get sick they cannot get a timely appointment with their primary care provider and they have to wait for hours to be seen in a crowded emergency department
6829997 meanwhile the government and insurance carriers continue to cut payments and avoid reimbursing for services its hard to imagine either candidate can keep the ship afloat without a major change in direction
6829998 they will be the best quality in town by a country mile
6829999 trading so far for the first half of the 2009 financial year has been very positive assisted by back orders we held at the beginning of the new financial year as well as particularly strong demand for our respiratory and acute care products
