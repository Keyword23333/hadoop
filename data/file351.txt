3510003 the r word is offensive and in this movie people with intellectual disabilities are portrayed in an offensive manner and its not funny
3510004 this movie uses the r word repeatedly and that word is extremely offensive to individuals with disabilities
3510005 although the general community and society dont believe that every time those words are used it breaks peoples hearts
3510006 it was not meant to offend anybody and when youre making an r rated comedy sometimes that happens but i was really clear in our point of view where the humor was coming from its at the expense of the actors and the characters in the movie
3510007 there have been certain stereotypes in other films but there has not been a film that has created such a frenzy within the disability community in any years that i can remember

3510022 from day one we have said we will only submit a planning application if we can design a wind turbine development that is appropriate for the location
3510023 the results of study work carried out so far continues to suggest that rushy mead is a good location to site wind turbines although we have found that the responsible maximum number of wind turbines should now be set at five rather than six
3510024 the decision to submit a planning application for a monitoring mast illustrates our commitment to gaining a detailed understanding of the local environment before progressing to a planning application
3510025 the wind data gathered will be used in conjunction with the results of other detailed environmental work to help us design the optimum wind turbine layout
3510026 we remain committed to fully engaging with the community and we are in the early stage of preparing for some consultation events in the local area
3510027 the dates and locations will be agreed with the local parish council and announced in the near future
3510028 we look forward to continuing to work with the town of prattsburgh and its residents and appreciate the strong support the project has received

3510031 but these are not the same lines that you see on his plan
3510032 so i guess ill vote for it again i guess this governor wont last forever
3510033 i think were going to see more than one eminent domain bill this time
3510034 this is a state that was still built on property rights
3510035 are they going to be what every property owner would like
3510036 probably not because everybody has rights under the law the people who condemn property as well as people who own that property but i think youll see substantial legislation in the next session
3510037 i think its going to be a big eminent domain session
3510038 this is an issue that has kind of bubbled up for about four or five years now because of a couple of court decisions and here in the state because of txdot
3510039 i think theres more sentiment right now for landowners rights than ive ever seen
3510040 i think frank phillips in borger is in the business of adopting a course of study now on the maintenance of wind turbines
3510041 weve got 150 thousand dollars coming from the county so that money is there i m suggesting we can save three positions in the fire department by combining fireman with fire inspector thats worth 300 thousand i f you just have the same cost savings this year and extend them to next year thats another 300 thousand

3510044 the base line of our concept is how do we encourage reuse and keep things out of the landfill

3510052 men will fight for superstition as quickly as for the living truth even more so since superstition is intangible you cant get at it to refute it but truth is a point of view and so is changeable

3510057 last year i introduced the appropriations bill earmark disclosure act a bill that will bring greater transparency to the budgeting process by requiring legislators to put their names on requests for funds going to local projects unfortunately the bill died because too many big spending politicians want to fund their pet projects in secret i support senator glenn mcconnells effort to push a commonsense conservative plan through the general assembly the people of south carolina should be able to hold legislators accountable for the decisions they make at the state house and roll call votes bring instant accountability to bring more transparency to state government i will ask for a roll call vote in the south carolina senate on any bill that requires a significant expenditure of state funds south carolina faces extraordinary challenges in education healthcare and energy we will never be able to solve those problems if state government keeps wasting taxpayer dollars i was elected on a commitment that i would do whatever i could to shake things up in columbia and tackle the tough problems facing our state i intend to make good on that commitment even if it means ruffling a few feathers along the way
3510058 his dad is of native american descent so we have chosen to raise him with certain beliefs in place one of them being that his hair is sacred and we dont cut it
3510059 no you cant do anything about the things you cant control
3510060 you just work on the things you can control and officials are something you cant control you just hope they have a good game

3510062 and youve got to look at the ref seventeen unawarded penalties thats bullshit
3510063 she igasan was impeded she couldnt play the ball that is how we saw it from our clipping
3510064 personally i think its a top four decision and im prepared to say that quite often the tough decisions go the way of the teams in the top four and you dont get the rub of the green and it was wrong and they also should have had a player sent off as well when we had a fast break
3510065 nine points is still in front of us you need six points out of the next two games and go into the argie game with nothing to lose
3510066 we had a plan and they stuck to it occasionally they didnt
3510067 it may have been a bit boring in places but they played pretty well and showed we should be here and not only should be here but should have a point draw
3510068 the original plan was to buy this horse bring to it to the games hopefully go well and then sell him but plans obviously change
3510069 ill go home now and consider my future but at this stage ill give it one more year at least theres a lot of improvement in this horse so i think maybe well keep going
3510070 i would love to go to world equestrian games in 2010 that kentucky is where i started off with the new zealand team in 1978 so it would be quite fun to go back there again and then look ahead to london
3510071 i love being in the whole atmosphere again its great being amongst a lot friends and people ive spent a lot of time with over the last 25 to 30 years
3510072 id never go back to having the big team i had ill be keeping it low profile and enjoying it
3510073 theres lots of things to consider i have another life breeding and training race horses in new zealand and we have a 15 year old son at school so all these things have to come into consideration
3510074 i have to go home and have a good think about it
3510075 the atheist himself confirms the reality of the god who created all things this is why when someone becomes a christian he immediately cares about those that are around him he cares about those who are unwanted in society the poor the bad and the ugly those that lack what society esteems this is because god put his love within him the moment that he repented and trusted the savior it is because of gods love that i care about the fate of those that lack intelligence atheists when the atheist says that there is no evidence that god exists i take the time to reason with him about creation not being an accident even though it is intellectually demeaning to have to do so atheism is the epitome of stupidity its an intellectual embarrassment but i have done so thousands of times and will do so until my last breath thanks alone to the love of god that dwells in me
3510076 god put his love within him the moment that he repented and trusted the savior
3510077 actually its not me that says that every building has a builder and that logically leads to the truth that creation therefore proves that there is a creator
3510078 for every house is built by some man but he that built all things is god

3510087 current communal tensions in indian occupied kashmir have little to do with pakistan at the moment but if they persist they may open up yet another pandoras box with devastating consequences for regional peace
3510088 one hopes that the indian army command is mindful of the muslim resentment against its soldiers and that it does not come down with a heavy hand on the local population as it is routinely accused of doing
3510089 security forces fired teargas and used batons on thursday against hundreds of angry people were protesting over assaults in occupied kashmir
3510090 the government was forced to revoke the land transfer last month after a week of violent protests by muslims who called the move an attempt to build hindu settlements in the area and alter the demographics in kashmir
3510091 rival resistance groups in the kashmir valley closed ranks on saturday against jammu based hindu activists who have stalled all transport services to srinagar and vowed to establish a trade corridor with muzaffarabad to defy the crippling blockade
3510092 troops open fire as 250 000 march to muzaffarabad aphc leader sheikh aziz killed
3510093 indian security forces shot to death five kashmiri protesters headed for the loc on monday including senior hurriyat conference leader sheikh abdul aziz his comrades said many were injured in the firing
3510094 meanwhile detained hurriyat leaders mirwaiz umer farooq and syed ali geelani have issued a joint statement announcing their decision to continue the march towards the loc tomorrow
3510095 a complete strike across kashmir has brought life to a grinding halt
3510096 indian troops on tuesday killed 15 more kashmiri people in the occupied kashmir

3510109 voters especially those awaiting federal flood relief deserve some honest answers and meaningful action from the people in congress like dave loebsack what they got was a congressional recess that means federal relief wont be approved until at least mid september
3510110 when he was asked about the congressional inaction on flood relief congressman loebsack said well at least i voted against the recess thats hardly the leadership voters expect
3510111 i think i need to be in two places at once
3510112 u s rep dave loebsack on recess from congress chilled out at the annual bluesmore music festival in cedar rapids on saturday night loebsack a democrat from mount vernon evidently was enjoying himself he kicked off his shoes and spent much of the night in his lawn chair barefoot there were no known reports of bunions even though dozens of other people stripped off their shoes too
3510113 that doesnt sound like someone determined to do his job he doesnt need to be in two places at the same time as long as he can chill out in one duck debates in the district and stay out of washington when constituents desperately need action on flood relief
3510114 when congressman loebsack and his colleagues left washington on aug 4 until mid september mariannette miller meeks challenged him to debate in each of the second districts 15 counties the word from congressman loebsacks campaign manager is that he would only agree to three debates at most shortly before the general election iowas second district deserves more than just being another old style politician who campaigns by claiming hes not campaigning and spends his time chilling out during his long recess
3510115 he was believed to be among the top leadership of al qaida
3510116 it is going to be a very difficult year for australia
3510117 it is absolutely essential that wayne swan the treasurer actually do everything he can to increase confidence in the australian economy and not reduce it as he was earlier in the year talking up an inflationary crisis as it was described early in the term of the government

3510119 a wikipedia editor emailed political wire to point out some similarities between sen john mccains speech today on the crisis in georgia and the wikipedia article on the country georgia given the closeness of the words and sentence structure most would consider parts of mccains speech to be derived directly from wikipedia

3510129 the phone will also bounce from 3g to edge to no service and then back to 3g the phone works fine if i turn off 3g but that defeats the purpose of having a 3g iphone

3510164 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
3510165 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

3510167 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
3510168 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
3510169 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
3510170 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
3510171 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
3510172 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
3510173 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
3510174 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
3510175 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
3510176 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
3510177 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
3510178 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
3510179 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
3510180 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
3510181 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

3510191 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
3510192 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
3510193 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
3510194 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

3510201 youd better have a good idea that will get us out of this
3510202 donna donna donna when have i ever let you down i am always full of brilliant ideas
3510203 by my reckoning we should be on prestine which is located on the spiral arm of the leroda galaxy it is known for its markets and it was the planet i wanted to take you to
3510204 a slight miscalculation it doesnt seem like it to me
3510205 as far as i can tell we have arrived during the time when the markets didnt exist not much is known about prestine before that so this war whatever it is does change prestine for the better but being caught up in it is not very good
3510206 surely us being here gives us the opportunity of discovering about a planets history that is not widely know
3510207 is quite a long time away and the market had to begin around this time in order tor its popularity to spread around the universe by the forty thousands
3510208 we will go to the proper time period we were heading for
3510209 maybe i may stick around despite the risk to ensure that history plays out as it should
3510210 you know its not safe to be out in these gardens especially since those spies were caught
3510211 fee they were caught they are not going to harm me
3510212 if two people can get in without being detected then so can many others for all we know there could be others and those two were just incredibly unlucky to be caught and you are forgetting a very important detail about yourself
3510213 you are the heir if something happens to you your father will be heirless do you really want your world to fall into disarray due to your premature death
3510214 i dont wish to mess this world up i mean who would want to hurt a sixteen year old girl
3510215 they can cause you father terrible pain if they captured or killed you that is why your safety is far more important then your fathers i appreciate you know how to defend yourself but the enemy is known to play a dirty game the fact that they managed to sneak in two spies into our very grounds without tripping our wards speaks volumes
3510216 if they have developed a way to get through our wards without tripping the alarms then surely that must mean someone close to dad is a traitor
3510217 if there is a traitor feeding information to the armorinians and i can be used against father then why havent they acted yet
3510218 if there are spies and their mission is to not get at me or my father then their objective is information information that could potentially ruin us if given to the wrong hands it could lead to our downfall but how does dad know who to trust
3510219 he just has to hope that they remain loyal to him
3510220 you say your names are the doctor and donna noble
3510221 you were caught entering the grounds bypassing the security systems that have been installed you claim you are just explorers travellers to be exact and that you arrived here by accident
3510222 i understand that my ship materialising in your garden does give the wrong impression i realise there is a war going on
3510223 but i did not know of it until the guards mentioned it when we were being escorted to the prison van
3510224 in all honesty donna and i are just travellers if you dont believe us then surely there is something we can do to prove our innocence to you
3510225 well if you are innocent then i suppose i could in order to find out use the mind probe on you it would hurt a lot and allow me access to your deepest and darkest fears and memories but would you consent to the pain
3510226 i will consent to the mind probe being used on me but donna is a human being and her brain would not be able to handle the probe it could kill her or drive her insane and i promised her grandfather that i would keep her safe allowing you to do that to her would be breaking that promise and i wouldnt be protecting her
3510227 you have accepted the mind probe on yourself and you have also made a plea to protect your friend which spies would never do from your actions hear in this very room i must conclude that you are not guilty
3510228 i had the impression that you genuinely didnt know what was going on this planet you are not even meant to be here at all that is obvious from your statements and my daughter also had an ominous feeling that you were just caught in the wrong place
3510229 auraya is my heir who will one day retain my duties of minister as her own
3510230 now i feel that i owe you two an apology for the way you were treated by my men when you arrived here i would be honoured if you would accept our hostility and stayed with us for a while
3510231 no apology is needed its easy to make an escape i do it all the time well sometimes actually
3510232 though i have to admit i am interested about the history of this war perhaps you could care to enlighten us
3510233 they didnt seem to be the type that would cause any harm
3510234 they did seem innocent through their aura i sensed that much however the male does have the distinct impression that he has killed many during his lifetime he is not entirely innocent but he is not guilty of being a spy for general sansheraz
3510235 are you going to explain to them the conflict to them
3510236 i will i think they would be very useful in aiding us i am glad that your psychic abilities are coming to the fore they will be a great asset to you when you assume my position i just hope that the war will be a thing of the past by the time i die and your reign is not tainted by this conflict i do intend auri for you to rule in peace and prosperity i just have to find the solution that will please general sansheraz and the armorinians
3510237 no it isnt and that wasnt on my mind at all perhaps the doctor and miss noble will be able to bring about a solution that will please both sides and allow peace to prosper between our peoples this has been going on for far too long
3510238 it depends on what this war is about and whether i can do anything useful that would bring about peace i do promise that i will give you some help whatever the situation is
3510239 if i can bring the end to this war with a minimal loss of life i will do so
3510240 if you two would care to follow me i will take you to my private quarters where i will explain this dire situation to you
3510241 auraya perhaps you could spend your time studying you do have your theory exams approaching rapidly
3510242 i hope you dont mind my ship staying in your beautiful garden
3510243 not at all its not really taking up much room i can hardly create a scene over a wooden box can i
3510244 yes i know we are on a different planet but they have the distinct aura that they well originated from earth
3510245 that does happen donna there are many worlds in this universe that resemble earth prestine is just one of many that relate to earth in differing ways
3510246 there are many humanoid forms in the universe for example
3510247 all three of us hail from different corners of the universe yet we look physically the same despite that we are completely different in on the inside evolution plays a big part in our lives there will always be similarities to other species wherever we go its universal fact
3510248 its not universal fact on earth mate they think its all green skinned aliens with large black eyes and small bits of hair on the top of their heads
3510249 youll get used to it i mean all the strange strange creatures that youll see through your travels with me that is
3510250 you may be wondering why my servants are not doing this it is because this room is for meeting purposes of friends and one where we can relax without the pressures of being waited on all the time it allows me a chance to do something normal for a change
3510251 it allows you to relate to your people even if it is such a small thing as making the tea
3510252 the war has raged for ten years before that we lived in peace then the armorinians came their representative general sansheraz claims that we have stolen their planet in their absence and they demand that we leave this world and settle elsewhere all our records show that we have prospered on this planet for over tens of thousands of years so sansherazs claim that the armorinians originated from this planet are unfounded this suggests to us that they are trying to bully us into leaving this world they do after all have a mighty fleet orbiting another planet in a nearby star system but they dont come from that world in these ten years they have attacked this world periodically giving us a lot of damage to our eco system to our plant life and to our general way of life they believe it will drive us out but we will never yield to their demands prestine is not their world it is ours
3510253 but it would mean opening up negotiations with this general sansheraz i avoid violence when i can and i will only help you if we can work to a peaceful solution
3510254 wait we are in a civic how in the world are we going to fit all this in

3510283 ive talked to my mum quite a bit and the phones ringing and theres a lot of media interest and of course its just my mum in christchurch shes not equipped to deal with something of this magnitude not that shes not capable its just that its so surreal that all of a sudden she gets drawn into this

3510309 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3510310 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3510311 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3510312 we cannot continue with a situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to the problem
3510313 sar ricordato dagli storici come un momento di svolta non meno significativo del crollo del muro di berlino

3510322 he obviously wasnt the player he is now and in fact it was like he wasnt really interested in playing tennis at that time
3510323 we were just kids back then he didnt appear focussed at all i wouldnt call it a temper but he did look like he had some concentration issues he was missing easy shots and getting irritated with himself

3510325 all the country did was to pile the pressure on rathore a medallist whos already achieved something for you and next time itll be abhinav bindra carrying that burden
3510326 shooting is where your medals are coming from rathore gave that first thrust and bindras gold has proven it beyond doubt
3510327 we need at least one world class shooting range in india befitting an olympic gold medal now
3510328 theres a reason why the sport gets expensive ranges in india arent equipped for modern day needs many date back to the infrastructure built in 1982 its obviously preferable to train abroad also we simply dont have as many coaches of calibre if mistakes seep into training early on which inevitably happens half your time is spent un learning that
3510329 people are falling over themselves to announce cash prizes to bindra now maybe some of them should also give cheques maybe one zero less to shooting ranges in their own state
3510330 true the next generation will not be as clueless as us in basic matters of what weapon what costume but if help doesnt come at the right time theyll take that much longer to make the jump from asian commonwealth to world and olympics
3510331 it has not changed me frankly all the attention is a bit overwhelming i am not much good at making loud public pronouncements that in no way means that this is not the most intense experience of my life
3510332 everyone who represents india at the olympic games has put in years of toil and sweat i ask the indian people to support our athletes more it is fine to celebrate our achievements but it is just as important to keep up the backing when we are not on top of our game
3510333 with our depth of talent and expanse of people i firmly believe india can be a world class sporting power what we need are precise systems
3510334 thousands of writers reporters and journalists have access to the virtual assistant industry survey it gives them all the information they need to write the articles and profiles that more accurately portray our profession and educate our marketplace thats why it is so very important that every virtual assistant take a moment to participate
3510335 our approach allows investors to obtain the very same benefits as they would with a hedge fund without the limitations usually associated with hedge funds
3510336 our philosophy is simple we don t charge any management fees but participate with a 10 performance fee and a high water mark the transparency of a separate managed account and the elimination of all hedge fund imposed barriers make our approach much more attractive to the investor
3510337 but unlike the original hell fire club my society isnt restricted to secluded meetings in the home counties
3510338 it has global reach because of the internet and is therefore more dangerous to conventional society
3510339 unlike the masons were out to rock society to its very foundations

3510345 over the years they have taught me about training methods and techniques nutrition dedication humility and work ethic just being around competitors like these at the top of their game is inspiring
3510346 its exciting to have to think on your feet during events a competitor can come to you in between races with a specific problem and expect you to fix it and quick the next race could be in 5 minutes
3510347 this was a week where the athletes knew that a few 1 100ths of a second could mean the difference between a trip to beijing to represent their country or a trip home to possibly continue training to try again in 4 years they needed every muscle involved to be working at its maximum potential my job was to make a small contribution towards them achieving their goals i feel honored to be afforded this rare opportunity to help

3510352 barotex enables our design team to create some of the strongest and most durable automotive components ever produced
3510353 for the natalia sls 2 barotex will be formed into various body panels and our revolutionary d tek chassis where its high strength will add significantly to the automobiles torsional rigidity yet our chassis will be more than a thousand pounds lighter than the conventional steel chassis found on other luxury automobiles of similar size
3510354 in contrast carbon fiber products are petroleum based and we know about the challenges that involves
3510355 not only is lava rock more abundant but our manufacturing process requires far less energy it is friendly to the environment and the automobiles built with barotex are lighter so they use less energy every mile traveled
3510356 we recently received our patent for the proprietary process used to produce barotex
3510357 we are delighted that the first production automobile to integrate this technology will be dimora s natalia sls 2 which abounds with technological breakthroughs from bumper to bumper
3510358 when we began designing our 16 cylinder engine that would erupt with 1200 horsepower we decided to call it the volcano v16 its only natural that we now surround the dimora volcano with volcanic rock from barotex

3510376 our morale is much better and i think were getting our fighting game back on
3510377 regarding this issue the scholars took 3 opinions two which took two opposite positions and a group that took an opinion between the two
3510378 the weakest of them is if a man touches a woman he loses his wudu this contention is based on the axiom a sound suspicion of something brings about that suspicions ruling
3510379 this is the opinion of the shafi school who hold that the touching of a woman breaks ones wudu irregardless if one felt a desire for the woman or not
3510380 if one touces a woman with a barrier between him and her such as gloves his wudu is valid even if he feels a desire for her this is the opinion of the hanafis
3510381 any touching of the opposite sex if not coupled with a feeling of passion does not break wudu
3510382 he went to pray thereafter and did not make wudu
3510383 dont touch them your wives while you are making itikaf in the masjid
3510384 if one were to touch a woman and he did so with no passionate feeling he is not punished meaning he did so on accident or due to a dire situation however if one was flirting or being handsy with a woman then he should be disciplined the same applies to a man who marries a woman touches her without lust and decides to divorce her that touch alone if it is free from passion does not oblige her to observe the ida according to the agreement of the scholars however there is a massive difference amongst the scholars on the payment of the mahr
3510385 there is not one narration from the companions that supports this contention
3510386 he would kiss his wife to to pray and not make wudu
3510387 monse or is disobeying the will of the pope and it is for that reason that in the charges we are filing with the prosecutor were asking that the holy see be notified so that he can be removed from office
3510388 attack on the freedom of expression and a sign of anti democratic disrespect for peaceful coexistence
3510389 the constitution clearly says that the right to life will be respected from conception if the little priest doesnt understand how sad he should go to a dictionary
3510390 and if he does understand and is tricking the people he should make an act of contrition and a firm purpose of amendment
3510391 all have the right to make free responsible and informed decisions regarding their reproductive health and life and to decide when and how many children to have and how often to have them
3510392 not only could gene similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3510393 oral contraceptives totally disrupt the normal hormonal cascade when the hormonal system is disrupted cardiovascular disease cancer fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome and other serious illnesses will increase my clinical experience has clearly shown that it is impossible to adequately treat these illnesses if there is an imbalanced hormonal system
3510394 i am anxious that we may be facing another situation where an innocent person is the victim of a violent crime
3510395 for the residents and neighbourhoods that comprise the manurewa community this prospect is doubly concerning
3510396 as a community we simply do not need the bad profile associated with this kind of incident because it diminishes the reputation of a place that is home to over 80 000 people the vast majority of whom are good law abiding folk
3510397 by any measure the residents of weymouth constantly make every effort to ensure that their neighbourhood is safe
3510398 notwithstanding the worrying prospect of the outcome of last nights incident weymouth will remain a great place to live both now and in the future
3510399 they just said a boy was shot in the head
3510400 i came outside and there were ambulances and cops galore
3510401 thanks cad people for screwing us over because youre so damn lazy to update your piece of junk software man it seems the only way to go about anything now is the microsoft way so microsoft wins yet again i see why no games are developed in opengl now
3510402 this is an unbelievable letdown i kind of saw it coming but i never expected the architecture review board arb to fail on such an immense scale
3510403 i find it astonishing how far some people can be removed from reality and yet not be immediately fired due to overwhelming incompetence this is the death of modern opengl thank you very much what microsoft never managed you did
3510404 opengl 3 0 is a significant evolutionary step that integrates new functionality to ensure that opengl is a truly state of the art graphics api while supporting a broad swathe of existing hardware
3510405 just as importantly opengl 3 0 sets the stage for a revolution to come we now have the roadmap machinery and momentum in place to rapidly and reliably develop opengl and are working closely with opencl to ensure that opengl plays a pivotal role in the ongoing revolution in programmable visual computing
3510406 web 2 0 has been hyped a lot to the extent that many investors view it as a bubble but in most cases it has not delivered tangible business value
3510407 we believe that it will follow the hype cycle and following initial disillusionment progress eventually to large scale shifts in creating intellectual capital and decision making
3510408 the main message of the hype cycle is that organisations need to make sure that when they adopt technologies early they do so for the right reasons because it is aligned with an area where it is important for them to innovate not because everyone is doing it
3510409 cryptography is notoriously hard to get right and if improperly used can create serious security holes
3510410 keyczars key versioning system makes it easy to rotate and revoke keys without worrying about backward compatibility or making any changes to source code
3510411 keyczar is essentially a library and doesnt actually serve keys or certificates
3510412 because we think it is not the right response to the balance of power in europe and between europe and russia and we want to have a dialogue with russia on the subject
3510413 i think the current conflict has moved us away from the map plan moving forward wouldnt be a great idea
3510414 it makes you ask about georgias motives for joining nato
3510415 the internet is a critical resource not only for government ministries but also in assisting the running of countries and such disruption can damage economies and impact the running of services
3510416 it is very interesting that georgia has turned to using the google blogger service as a method of communication during such an attack and it has proved to be a sustainable resource governments will need to have strategies in place to prepare for this type of attack
3510417 we are witnessing in this crisis the birth of true operational cyber warfare
3510418 the use of cyber attack assets in conjunction with kinetic military operations in the current crisis now stands among the most significant developments ever seen in the field of information security or cyber conflict studies
3510419 moreover that the attackers are mostly decentralized civilians suggests that the evolution of political and strategic hacking will be messier and more disruptive than even pessimistic strategic theorists have supposed
3510420 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3510421 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3510422 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3510423 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3510424 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3510425 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3510426 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3510427 longs has a significant presence in 10 non cvs markets that are among the top 100 drugstore markets in the country
3510428 longs store network in these regions is excellent and is one that would take a decade or more for us to replicate through organic growth
3510429 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3510430 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3510431 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3510432 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3510433 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3510434 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3510435 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3510438 the odd thing about this issue is that once someone at our main office logs in with the affected employees information the employee is able to login at the same computer that did not work for him before
3510439 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3510440 we therefore recommend to the software updates from apple in the eye this you get through itunes
3510441 we advise customers to keep an eye on apples software updates
3510442 companys coming to our church every sunday and what visitors perceive in our welcome will influence their feelings and response to church and the lord for years to come

3510449 today were kicking off our school year the teachers are getting excited for the kids to come and a lot of the local conway businesses are giving the teachers free things to get their year started
3510450 thats why its so important that the community does support the teachers conway is really big on that and we get a lot of support from people
3510451 the support system here in conway for the teachers is phenomenal all these businesses come out and give teachers products that are going to help them in their classrooms and just thank them for all they do for our students
3510452 it was the first thing that popped into my head
3510453 traveling in general puts pressure on the family unit but when you have a child with a disability there are very often larger issues
3510454 food for four days and putting everything into a grid putting everything into the freezer portion controlled
3510455 one hurdle that were still facing as far as going away or that myself or my husband or my nanny is not there is that zak gets a hormone shot every night and were the only three people that know how
3510456 when you have a child who doesnt speak i cant explain anything
3510457 i had to go to vegas for four days to work on a show
3510458 i cant explain that to him that mommys going to be gone for four days the next day he wakes up and his mother is just gone its got to be traumatizing
3510459 emerson is a child with a mental disability we found out a year and a half into his life that he was born with a chromosome abnormality as a result he had many physical problems early on and currently struggles with a severe speech delay

3510500 we started in my garage two years ago and were producing barrels today so things are moving pretty quickly
3510501 so these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3510502 scalability is really the critical issue if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3510503 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3510504 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue

3510554 the recent volatility in most of these metals and currency markets appears to indicate a shift in the long term trends of the dollar the euro and the precious metals
3510555 in ideal years farmers will harvest 90 percent and lose 10 percent to the usual factors and nonetheless the usda says they will harvest more than 91 percent so thats perplexing
3510556 farmers have not been selling much grain at these levels
3510557 those with the honour of knowing master cpl doyle which is almost everyone in the canadian army describe him as a warrior who was larger than life
3510558 all who served with erin wanted to be beside him especially at the most dangerous times of the mission
3510559 he could raise morale with a look a gesture or a practical joke
3510560 he passed on all the wealth of his experience to his platoon when he spoke they listened and he never had to repeat himself twice when correcting a soldier
3510561 im personally inspired every day by all the soldiers across the battle group but there are a few across the battle group who inspire me a little more when i come across them and doyle was one of those guys
3510562 he always had some ideas about how we could improve things he always thought twice about what we were doing and how we could make it better
3510563 i cant imagine getting on with public hearings much before february
3510564 i fully expected them to be up and running late this fall
3510565 im shocked and disappointed that they dont think they can actually get going until february
3510566 i dont believe harper ever really wanted an inquiry at all but certainly not before an election
3510567 our fear is more about running out of time than any perception of bias
3510568 theres usually a huge amount of paper that you have to go through
3510569 he has served this government very well but when asked to serve has not made a commitment beyond one term
3510570 the prime minister has not gone to him he has not gone to the prime minister
3510571 i have a position on that at this point but im not prepared to discuss it
3510572 i would think that the premier will come out take a stand on this
3510573 undoubtedly hes assessing the total effect on the province and im sure well hear from him on it very soon
3510574 the vast majority of families in newfoundland are going to be significant beneficiaries of any change that the liberal government brings in
3510575 of course the tories will lie about our plan thats what we expect them to do the fact of the matter is were talking about the biggest tax cut for ordinary families in a generation
3510576 everybody knows from premier williams on down that the harper approach to government is a disaster for newfoundland
3510577 the messaging here is harder for the liberals its kind of a leap of faith to suggest that this shift will actually work
3510578 at this point the prime minister has yet to accept all or any of those options put forward by premier williams some eight months ago
3510579 over the last several days canadians have watched with great concern as the conflict has escalated
3510580 canada will continue to stand ready to provide humanitarian assistance as needed as we monitor the situation
3510581 in response to the urgent and ongoing needs of thousands effected by the conflict the red cross has made a worldwide appeal to the public for 8 million
3510582 in katelynns death shes speaking out to us to ask us to end violence and addiction and abuse
3510583 we cant forget to forget is to not do anything and something has to be done to stop this type of stuff from happening
3510584 its basic stuff that frankly they should be getting right
3510585 they make up a substantial portion of our force and we couldnt function in afghanistan without them
3510586 a reservist whose need for care arises from military duty is entitled to the same care as his or her regular force counterparts
3510587 individuals not only served in theatre but paid an extra price
3510588 it is the committees belief that canadian military personnel wounded in the service of their country should receive one standard of rehabilitative treatment when they return home first class
3510589 if all provinces cannot or will not provide this first class level of treatment the federal government should step in and ensure that it is made available to every wounded returnee

3510591 i like mourinho but he likes to court the press and he can be provocative
3510592 i enjoy our exchanges but the important thing is not to take what he says seriously
3510593 the only area that is working is the midfield and the injuries we have had are taking their toll
3510594 he played for the national team when he was injured and this should not have happened
3510595 the italy medical staff wrote it off as a muscle problem but if he had been with his club we would have ordered an x ray
3510596 we need to wrap up qualification in the first game at home
3510597 we know that the opposition is not that great and although they can score goals we are solid at the back
3510598 he said he wanted to spend time with his family but now we are expecting him to come back into the game and take up a role with us

3510615 the source reportedly told the newspaper that in addition to speaking and body language advice clooney a pro palestinian advocate is informally advising obama on middle east issues including advocating unconditional withdrawal from iraq should obama win office

3510652 allowed state institutions to deal with private banks a jurisprudence says that the private banks to deposit 75 of government deposits with the central bank to keep its 25 only for investment

3510659 improvement in the deal because they will stand as he says on an equal footing with state owned banks including requiring banks to correct those of their management
3510660 the central bank to issue clear instructions based on the laws in force to the private banks would begin working to implement the new stage

3510663 i took a look at the radar and i knew we were going to get hammered bad
3510664 the engineer went down yesterday and pulled the cover off the channel down there there was no restriction whatsoever there was just too much water pure and simple
3510665 the development up in east and north greenbush we want them to put a retention pond up there thats feeding into south street with a tremendous amount of water thats never been there before
3510666 there are big culverts that are blocking water im afraid that if we get another rain were going to have another disaster here
3510667 basically what theyre going to have to do is have a licensed professional come in and inspect the electrical system and gas system before nimo will turn it back on thats at nimos request
3510668 there are some at usa swimming who dont want any of this to get out
3510669 this is really about giving coaches a rigorous knowledge base to know why theyre doing what theyre doing and know why it works or why something doesnt work
3510670 changed the breaststroke kick of all his swimmers and ariana kukors shaved three seconds off her 100 meter breaststroke time
3510671 they look at all the top swimmers they get their elbow up high in the water and basically pull right through
3510672 its not something were going to share specifically to every country
3510673 we have substantial leaks were actually having damage to the interior of the facility which is a huge concern for us
3510674 we need to raise upwards of 300 000 to actually do the entire roof to deal with interior damage and to deal with anything they find underneath the roof
3510675 it might mean cutting some programs and reorganizing things a bit we might have to do that we really want to avoid having to do that because these programs are so essential to working families in the county so we hope we dont have to cut any programs
3510676 weve completed part of the project out of an emergency fund which we need to pay back just for the gym we spent 60 000 so to do the rest of the project we really need to raise a substantial amount of money and do that before the snow falls
3510677 the situation was a little different then because there were two year terms the mayor then edward reed became ill in february of 1919 and the president of the common council julius jacobson actually held the position for well over a year
3510678 he filled the slot until an election which was shortly thereafter the situation we have now is that jack diamond had been filling in for the mayor right now state law the public officers law and the city charter the read on that is that there will be an election in november
3510679 the five major parties republican democrat conservative independence and working families can each choose one person from their party to go on the ballot in november in addition any independent upon getting the necessary signatures can be entered on the ballot
3510680 el funcionario p blico s lo puede hacer lo que la ley le obliga entonces no puede salirse de ese margen se tendr a que hacer una reforma para que el asunto est plenamente justificado conforme a derecho
3510681 i just kind of had fun with it and that helped a lot
3510682 it almost didnt feel like the olympic games that was probably good in a sense
3510683 it was a great show and i hope we have many more
3510684 i knew they were going to give him everything he wanted
3510685 the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it obviously its a lot of tears and a lot of hugs
3510686 i dont know how to better represent them than to sit here with a gold medal in my hand
3510687 of course i could do with a bit more time but ill just go in and give it a go
3510688 it normally takes six months to a year to reopen we did this whole thing in 70 days the management team including myself put in a lot of long days we were working 6 7 days a week from 9am to 2am we just all put a lot of sweat and muscle work into it to make sure we got it right
3510689 abbiamo fatto un bel primo tempo ora ci sar il secondo a praga
3510690 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3510691 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3510692 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3510693 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3510694 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3510695 no disrespect intended ill just take my chances you know
3510696 weve run 35 hundred miles for 35 hundred service members killed in operation iraqi freedom
3510697 my son liked what he was doing he was making a career out of the army
3510698 saying we honor them and having someone actually do it means the ultimate for us
3510699 it just seems like everybody forgets but these people have made it a point not to forget the fallen
3510700 the photo showing miley draped in a sheet back bared hair tousled with a come hither smile upset countless parents who immediately grasped the photos essential vulgarity
3510701 now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them
3510702 let the children come to me and do not hinder them for to such belongs the kingdom of god
3510703 whoever receives one such child in my name receives me but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea
3510704 the real reason that black people are so unawaer tha they are being targeted for genocide is because the school system doesnt educate us enough to make a conscious decision when it come to contraceptive methods
3510705 on for right brother torch brother propaganda symbol second birds the the symbol news is right torch sex chinese general sex just
3510706 uh say it a little louder i dont think the old lady in the back row heard you
3510707 youre gonna take the only person in your life thats there purely for sex no strings attached and turn him into a human being on

3510711 and youre generally guaranteed delivery within a thirty minute radius within six hours or less
3510712 fue bueno para mi tener un acercamiento con los aficionados ahora intentar dar mi mayor esfuerzo en cada partido que juegue
3510713 el domingo fue incre ble el ambiente en el estadio los aficionados son muy importantes para nosotros porque se viven grandes sensaciones jugar frente a ellos
3510714 ahora el equipo es muy fuerte aunque necesitamos guardar nuestra forma f sica para enfrentar la pr xima semana al middlesbrough y as arrancar de la mejor manera posible la pr xima temporada
3510715 roma fue defensivo en el primer tiempo por lo que el partido se volvi muy cerrado pero en la parte complementaria fue bueno ya que fue m s abierto
3510716 gobierno apunta hacia eliminaci n progresiva del subsidio a combustibles
3510717 es peligroso que salga en libertad pero no s lo para nosotros sino tambi n para l
3510718 hay tantas personas que tienen aversi n por chapman que lo mejor para l es quedarse en la c rcel
3510719 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3510720 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3510721 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3510722 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3510723 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3510724 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3510725 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3510726 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3510727 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3510728 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3510729 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3510730 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3510731 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3510732 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3510733 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3510734 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3510735 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3510736 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3510737 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3510738 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3510739 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3510740 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3510741 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3510742 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3510743 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3510744 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3510745 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3510746 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3510747 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3510748 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3510749 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3510750 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3510751 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3510752 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3510753 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3510754 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3510755 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3510756 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3510757 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3510758 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3510759 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3510760 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3510761 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3510762 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3510763 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3510764 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3510765 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3510766 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3510767 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3510768 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3510769 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3510770 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3510771 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3510772 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3510773 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3510774 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3510775 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3510776 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3510777 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3510778 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3510779 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3510780 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3510781 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3510782 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3510783 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3510784 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3510785 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3510786 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3510787 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3510788 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3510789 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3510790 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3510791 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3510792 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3510793 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3510794 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3510795 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3510796 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3510797 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3510798 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3510799 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3510800 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3510801 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3510802 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3510803 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3510804 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3510805 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3510806 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3510807 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3510808 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3510809 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3510810 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3510811 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3510812 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3510813 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3510814 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3510815 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3510816 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3510817 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3510818 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3510819 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3510820 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3510821 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3510822 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3510823 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3510824 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3510825 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3510826 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3510827 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3510828 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3510829 in much the same way the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells
3510830 star wars didnt really nuke the fridge until jar jar binks was introduced
3510831 peter parker dancing around the bar in spider man 3 kinda nukes the fridge
3510832 if that is not a transmission problem then i fuck goats that have been set on fire while people in clown suits dance around me and throw little pickles at my feet
3510833 he makes it a point to convey to me how he so loves fish hes constantly talking about how he eats it all the time and makes off topic and out of context references to sushi
3510834 that girl was just not right for you the one for you will be someone who the one for you will want you for that
3510835 would you mind if i kept you in a well and made a coat out of your skin
3510836 i found her hairbrush in the trash its all mine now
3510837 useless this is the whipped side i sense in you forever will it dominate your destiny
3510838 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3510839 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3510840 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3510841 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3510842 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3510843 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3510844 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3510845 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3510846 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3510847 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3510848 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3510849 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3510850 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3510851 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3510852 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3510853 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3510854 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3510855 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3510856 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3510857 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3510858 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3510859 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3510860 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3510861 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3510862 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3510863 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3510864 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3510865 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3510866 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3510867 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3510868 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3510869 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3510870 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3510871 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3510872 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3510873 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3510874 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3510875 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3510876 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3510877 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3510878 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3510879 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3510880 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3510881 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3510882 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3510883 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3510884 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3510885 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3510886 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3510887 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3510888 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3510889 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3510890 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3510891 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3510892 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3510893 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3510894 i cant promise that but i can promise that if he stays with you he will die
3510895 i only did what was normal i could have done more
3510896 if you see someone drowning you must jump in and try to save them even if you dont know how to swim
3510897 when the war started all of poland was drowning in a sea of blood but most of all it affected the jewish nation and within that nation it was the children who suffered most thats why we needed to give our hearts to them
3510898 how many mothers can a person have this is my third
3510899 the most defenseless victims of the nazi ideology the jewish children
3510900 great heroine who can be justly named for the nobel peace prize she deserves great respect from our whole nation
3510901 i remember your face you took me out of the ghetto
3510902 after the second world war it seemed that humanity understood something and that nothing like that would happen again
3510903 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3510904 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3510905 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3510906 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3510907 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3510908 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3510909 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3510910 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3510911 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3510912 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3510913 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3510914 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3510915 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3510916 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3510917 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3510918 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3510919 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3510920 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3510921 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3510922 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3510923 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3510924 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3510925 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3510926 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3510927 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3510928 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3510929 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3510930 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3510931 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3510932 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3510933 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3510934 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3510935 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3510936 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3510937 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3510938 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3510939 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3510940 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3510941 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3510942 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3510943 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3510944 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3510945 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3510946 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3510947 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3510948 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3510949 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3510950 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3510951 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3510952 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3510953 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3510954 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3510955 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3510956 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3510957 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3510958 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3510959 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3510960 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3510961 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3510962 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3510963 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3510964 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3510965 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3510966 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3510967 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3510968 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3510969 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3510970 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3510971 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3510972 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3510973 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3510974 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3510975 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3510976 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3510977 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3510978 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3510979 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3510980 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3510981 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3510982 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3510983 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3510984 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3510985 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3510986 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3510987 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3510988 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3510989 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3510990 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3510991 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3510992 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3510993 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3510994 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3510995 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3510996 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3510997 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3510998 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3510999 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3511000 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3511001 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3511002 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3511003 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3511004 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3511005 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3511006 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3511007 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3511008 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3511009 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3511010 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3511011 my work unit offered me this opportunity they got us tickets
3511012 we learnt the etiquette one should observe when watching the game
3511013 we shouldnt walk around when games are in progress we shouldnt talk loudly and we should applaud for both parties
3511014 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3511015 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3511016 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3511017 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3511018 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3511019 if youre not involved in the sport im not sure you can fully appreciate it
3511020 he is way past anything you have seen he is incredible
3511021 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3511022 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3511023 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3511024 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning
3511025 when i lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3511026 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3511027 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3511028 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3511029 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3511030 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3511031 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3511032 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3511033 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3511034 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3511035 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3511036 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3511037 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3511038 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3511039 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3511040 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3511041 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3511042 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3511043 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3511044 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3511045 will be available as well prices were not immediately available
3511046 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3511047 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3511048 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3511049 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3511050 pour avoir de lexp rience il faut tout dabord quon nous laisse une chance
3511051 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3511052 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3511053 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3511054 yes thats right drink up let the lbs slide on your hips and arms that tummy could use some marks as well
3511055 shit you didnt have to go through what i just went through
3511056 its unbelievable like a dream come true for me im very emotional and cant really speak
3511057 we have to look at how were going to create better possibilities with our riders and how were going to work with them in the future its time for assessment we need to do better than this
3511058 i always knew he was the best event horse in the world he had his day to shine at the olympic games
3511059 i would love to go to world equestrian games in 2010 that kentucky is where i started off with the new zealand team in 1978 so it would be quite fun to go back there again and then look ahead to london i have to go home and have a good think about it ive enjoyed this i like riding this horse i think theres a lot of improvement in him we just have to work out a programme
3511060 this horse means everything to my career i would be nothing without this horse i am a dental surgeon and dentist i ride after work
3511061 thats the first mistake hes made in two years you could hope for a higher medal but it didnt happen
3511062 this is the realisation of a dream i have waited a while i went to sydney as reserve which was a fantastic experience but also a frustrating one this year i was originally on the reserve list and only came here because zara philips and lucy wiegersma couldnt i always thought that if i got the chance i could show the world what i could do today i got that chance
3511063 fundamentally it was a fantastic ride and probably as good a ride as hes ever done on that horse on a tough and technical course so yes were disappointed but it could have been very different
3511064 im definitely very pleased it is amazing to go to your first games and come home with some kind of bling
3511065 she was put up to it but it was not for her to make changes at that stage its a point of principle because it undermines the authority of the ground jury and the technical delegate
3511066 ive learnt a lot about the horse its a shame i had to learn about him here when i came out of the cross country i was disappointed and then you analyse everything hes very green for this ill make a plan for what i think i have to do to be competitive
3511067 its most satisfying to get back what they took from us what happened in athens gave us wings for this achievement
3511068 he got a bit wild fired up because there was a big crowd here tonight
3511069 he just wasnt himself i dont know whether he was tired or sore hes usually a careful jumper
3511070 i know i dont always ride the prettiest round in the world but the prettiest thing we were after is that zero penalties on the board so therefore i think its probably been one of the prettiest rounds of the night
3511071 el gobierno apunta hacia la eliminaci n progresiva del subsidio a los combustibles
3511072 gobierno apunta hacia eliminaci n progresiva del subsidio a combustibles
3511073 el fondo necesitaba un volumen creciente de recursos fiscales y ahora se van a reducir lo han hecho aprovechando la baja internacional del petr leo que ya est por menos de 115 d lares el barril me parece una buena decisi n porque es siempre prudente ir hacia un sinceramiento
3511074 y hacer que la econom a absorba esta circunstancia y se acomode dentro de los mecanismos internos de productividad y de costos
3511075 lo peor ser a acostumbrarse a esa muleta el fondo porque cuando se empiezan a agravar estas circunstancias de subsidio que son artificiales termina en alg n momento por romper las posibilidades fiscales y produce reajustes que terminan siendo catastr ficos si se hace el ajuste progresivamente y se sinceran los procesos la econom a tiene que acomodarse a esa realidad felizmente el per tiene fuentes de energ a y no va a estar desabastecido

3511080 the nearby streams got depleted and thus locals were forced to fetch water on donkeys from very far areas sometimes you go for five km to bring 40 liter of water which can only be enough for cooking and drinking purposes you do washing or cleaning of clothes once a week
3511081 though i love my village the circumstances and the lack of water forced me to leave for the city where government water networks are available i think the increase of population is responsible for the water crisis as well as the decreasing level of rainfall he added

3511090 we regularly check our records and detect a record keeping anomaly on average once a year
3511091 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3511092 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3511093 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3511094 we cannot continue with a situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to the problem
3511095 what was it that made so many survive where others simply gave up and died
3511096 i knew that i couldnt simply give up because i had a purpose to at least try to live for

3511112 we need to take care of it for our tourism industry but the big problem is not on the beach its whats happening in the seas

3511118 wisconsin had the 9th highest state local tax burden in the country up from 10th last year wisconsin taxpayers pay 10 2 of their income toward state and local taxes the tax foundation has compiled a list ranking states on their state local tax burdens since 1977 wisconsin has been in the top ten every year many years wisconsin was in the top five
3511119 there needs to be some restraint on the increase in state and local taxes
3511120 folks this is wisconsin were talking about slowing the rate of increase in taxation we tried that a few years ago it was called tabor the taxpayers bill of rights remember the reaction
3511121 ten years of tabor a study of colorados taxpayers bill of rights
3511122 i could see very liberal folks saying you have to pass tabor thats my worst nightmare to institute a taxpayer bill of rights now
3511123 these schools that are crying the sky is falling and will fall under tabor are just barking up the wrong tree they are adding more teachers spending more per student and saying theres not enough money

3511144 non government actors in the mindanao peace process and worked hard at gaining a deep understanding of the ancestral domain issues and that various other factors that have hampered mindanao peace and development
3511145 the malaysian government had served as host and facilitator of the grp milf peace talks since 2001 and opposed an american presence at the negotiating table moros suspected usips presence motives and relationship with the u s government usip lacking a permanent base in mindanao also faced challenges in establishing strong channels of communication with the grp milf and civil society multiple changes in the composition of the grp negotiating team and divergent perspectives and agendas within the moro leadership and communities further complicated the peace facilitation effort at times senior grp officials lukewarm support for an equitable and effective peace agreement hampered the efforts of skilled and committed negotiators corruption and criminality among the moros exacerbated by centuries old clan loyalties created other hurdles
3511146 usip introduced concepts and approaches that were useful to both government and milf peace panels it helped inform the philippine population and elites in manila in particular of issues underlying the conflict in mindanao while presenting potentially viable means of resolving them the institutes efforts have added marginally to more balanced media coverage
3511147 usip funding supported the publication of policy papers which were distributed to scholars analysts journalists and policymakers usip also sponsored educational materials for use in philippine schools
3511148 who is in charge of this vehicle called the peace process and why is it crucial to have a driver at the tactical level will there be a real permanent empowered team on the grp side that could pull off the job including selling the merits of a settlement on ancestral domain to the philippine congress the mindanao power brokers the corporations and so on at the strategic level who will marshal public support for a moro ancestral domain who will start and sustain a badly needed effort at national reconciliation the inclusion of the moro narrative into philippine national history and the overcoming of deep seated anti moro prejudice in the grp peace panel there is some interest in precedents elsewhere where the ruling regime has apologized to its oppressed minority for example in new zealand an apology to the moros from manila would probably vitiate moro resentment to a significant extent but it is too much to hope for from the government 3 who will show us the money who will fund the implementation of an ancestral domain agreement what resources will be used to compensate parties whose interests may be compromised by concessions to the moros on territory and resources who will fund the sustained training of moro administrative professionals and a moro technocratic cadre that can effectively manage and develop moro ancestral domain
3511149 support the ceasefire the ceasefire has been the single greatest success of the peace process but it remains fragile monitoring mechanisms on the ground need to be bolstered with training funds and other support as long as the ceasefire holds the parties can keep negotiating thorny issues and it is better for them to keep talking even if it takes years the problem is when shooting begins helping to support the ceasefire would be a relatively inexpensive endeavor for the u s but it could go a very long way in generating good will towards us and enhancing our credibility on peace in muslim mindanao such good will and credibility could eventually enhance our interest in combating terrorism we need good intelligence to be effective and people will talk to us only when we have earned their trust make available to the parties the best available practices and lessons from other countries that have resolved issues similar to ancestral domain with their own minorities the grp and milf for example have both expressed interest in the experiences of northern ireland new zealand with the maoris sudan and other countries make a generous offer of post agreement development assistance more than the 30 million offered previously it would not hurt now for us to work with the bangsamoro development agency bda it is a group run by competent individuals and they are focused on weeding out corruption early in the process of development training
3511150 the opening ceremony was a success we truly are one world one dream
3511151 de conformidad con el reglamento de la corte el gobierno de chile ha sido informado que la corte internacional de justicia y el gobierno del per no formularon observaciones a esta designaci n
3511152 i would have launched him 30 years ago after he finished his stint as an assistant director to me on dharam karam
3511153 i got into a marketing job and travelled the world i helped sell amusement parks across the globe including our very own fantasy land for that at least my kids were happy with me
3511154 dutta kohli and i were the three musketeers notorious for the mischief we caused on the sets
3511155 while i was settled in sharjah i started writing scripts in my head
3511156 acting happened by mistake though for the moment it seems to be suiting me fine
3511157 i guess its something i have to do before i finally get on to direction
3511158 were addressing the level and nature of his association with the cavs going forward
3511159 as a young child nick was very busy always on the move and always smiling
3511160 nick still has that million dollar smile that captivates your heart instantly we all look forward to nicks periodic returns home to catch up and be entertained by his firework displays
3511161 nicks greatness stems from a strong family team with parents and a sister that have given everything to support his success
3511162 a lot of his american friends may not realize that nick was a left handed pitcher nick pitched or played first base some outfield and believe it or not he even was a catcher in his early years there were lots of times when his dad was working i would catch for nick while he practiced his pitching or did a little batting practice or long toss i always knew nick had a special talent and would make us proud
3511163 at nicks draft party we were all waiting and listening over the internet
3511164 then we heard nick weglarz taken by the cleveland indians and i grabbed one of my very best friends and hugged her and started singing cleveland rocks
3511165 in canada we have a later graduation in late june so nick could not leave right away for burlington until after he graduated
3511166 on graduation night nicks school had presented him with a special award because he was the fist graduate of the school to make his dream a reality
3511167 in his first professional baseball game he went 0 for 4 with four strikeouts
3511168 being a mom i just wanted to reach out to him but the next day he came back and got a few hits we had to go to burlington the first weekend because they would not sell nick a cell phone since he was too young so i had to sign a contract for him we met many nice people in burlington which i still keep in contact with and it was so nice just knowing that if nick needed something they were there for him
3511169 the year he missed with a broken hamate bone was a long and frustrating time
3511170 cleveland did take very good care of nick giving him the top treatment flying from florida to baltimore to have surgery and then staying in a hotel room going for treatment then flying back to akron using their facilities to rehab before the team came to the park and then finally going to mahoney valley just to do on field workouts with them and at least feeling like he was part of the team mentally he showed us he sure wanted his dream and it proved to us how much he wants to make it to the major leagues we just couldnt be any prouder of him
3511171 nick had many fans cheering for him he had a lake county grandma that always makes the boys their birthday cakes since most are so far from home being a december baby nick was a little more spoiled i think as grandma was always bringing him home made fudge or chocolate chip cookies we were lucky enough to meet grandma and her family also we were at the game when nick actually hit himself in the face on the screen in center field what a home run
3511172 nick has improved so much with his base running and outfield play during his time in kinston
3511173 nick keeps getting stronger as the season goes on we have only gone to see nick once in kinston since it took 16 hours going there but only 13 hours coming home it is a very nice park and friendly staff and broadcaster and team media relations director chris hemeyer has been such a great help this season nick had to have a picture sent for the beijing olympic committee and chris was right there to help i wish this park wasnt so far away
3511174 besides finally making your dream come true how much more could you ask for than to wear canada across your chest
3511175 just when we think we cant get any prouder nick goes and does something else
3511176 id say we are top four and can be right there the last olympics we came in fourth we have a good team so i am sure we are going to do well and maybe surprise some people
3511177 so that is a good experience in itself plus we played about five exhibition games against team usa and they are all double a and triple a guys so i got some time in against them also you play against the different countries that have a different style of play it is just something that you cant duplicate in minor league baseball
3511178 we cant wait for the first game it rained for one of the exhibition games against the netherlands so nick is getting excited for the first game because of the time of the first game for us we will be watching alone but fridays game we will cheer on with family
3511179 nick has a heart of gold and monumental determination towards whatever he strives to do
3511180 nick has been with me on many occasions that he has proven this to me the whole family cant be any prouder then they have been along his whole career
3511181 the largest update to team fortress 2 since it was first released

3511184 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
3511185 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3511186 reiterated the resolve of the nation to remain determined and not yield to pressures created by such heinous crimes
3511187 engaged in the business of discovering and developing artists in the music industry
3511188 it became clear that hudgens and her new team all directed by her father would take every possible opportunity to deprive vieira of the benefits to be derived from the settlement agreement
3511189 no other monies have been paid to vieira and no other accounting has been provided
3511190 i would anticipate that a number of criminal cases would come out of this criminal investigation
3511191 the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop graphics processor unit business
3511192 that the thoughts prayers and support of the american people are with that great little nation as it struggles today
3511193 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3511194 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3511195 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3511196 like many im astounded at barack obamas meteoric rise as a candidate but i have no doubt that his is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for
3511197 scientists have created two new types of materials that can bend light the wrong way creating the first step toward an invisibility cloaking device
3511198 we had been through several inspections they were all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change
3511199 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in the aspect of voice yang peiyi is flawless in each member of our teams view
3511200 i am satisfied that my voice appeared in the opening ceremony

3511207 in taanis 9 we find that chazal cite the phrase literally you shall surely give a tenth of your earnings and reinterpret the second word as tasheir instead of taser this alters the meaning to give a tenth so that you will become wealthy here we have an assurance that if we faithfully give away a tenth of our earnings we will be successful financially i have given maaser assiduously my whole life why then have i have not merited wealth
3511208 let me tell you a true story about my neighbor that sheds light on your question
3511209 giving maaser can propel ones financial success forward just as the horses hitched to the wagon will propel it toward its destination however if the brakes are engaged at the same time the driver wont get anywhere at all if you are braking by failing to observe shabbos and kashrus properly the horses are not to blame for your inability to reach your goal you must release the break mechanism by doing teshuvah and changing your behavior
3511210 leading up to this and i was ready to be done with it

3511220 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen

3511222 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3511223 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3511224 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3511225 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3511261 directives on the use of the name of god in the sacred liturgy
3511262 some impact on the use of particular pieces of liturgical music in our country as well as in the composition of variable texts such as the general intercessions for the celebration of the mass and the other sacraments
3511263 ask them to try to come up with alternate language
3511264 it may take time for people to get used to singing something different
3511265 an opportunity to offer catechesis for the faithful as an encouragement to show reverence for the name of god in daily life emphasizing the power of language as an act of devotion and worship
3511266 by directive of the holy father in accord with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith this congregation deems it convenient to communicate to the bishops conferences as regards the translation and the pronunciation in a liturgical setting of the divine name signified in the sacred tetragrammaton
3511267 as an expression of the infinite greatness and majesty of god it was held to be unpronounceable and hence was replaced during the reading of sacred scripture by means of the use of an alternate name adonai which means lord
3511268 avoiding pronouncing the tetragrammaton of the name of god on the part of the church has therefore its own grounds
3511269 apart from a motive of a purely philological order there is also that of remaining faithful to the churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
3511270 the name of almighty god expressed by the hebrew tetragrammaton and rendered in latin by the word dominus is to be rendered into any given vernacular by a word equivalent in meaning
3511271 notwithstanding such a clear norm in recent years the practice has crept in of pronouncing the god of israels proper name
3511272 the practice of vocalizing it is met with both in the reading of biblical texts taken from the lectionary as well as in prayers and hymns and it occurs in diverse written and spoken forms

3511408 e che tra laltro sta per tornare dal 1 settembre
3511409 congressman poe and i had a very informative meeting with representatives from the west brook bus crash families today these parents have undergone tremendous heartache yet they continue to fight tirelessly to improve bus safety standards in texas and across the country
3511410 their tragedy and the recent fatal accident in sherman that took the lives of 17 members of a houston church group underscore the importance of addressing bus safety as quickly as possible to prevent future tragedies whether its in the area of manufacturing licensing or law enforcement bus safety reform is an issue i will push the senate to review immediately and comprehensively
3511411 i want to continue this important dialogue with advocacy groups like the west brook bus crash families to ensure their concerns are being heard on the federal level church groups sports teams and other groups traveling in motor coaches or school buses need the assurance that their government leaders are taking every possible step to ensure their safety my thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those who were killed in sherman last week and also to the west brook parents who continue to cope with the tragic losses and injuries that occurred in 2006
3511412 i am proud to work with senator cornyn on this important issue recent tragedies reinforce the need to promote effective bus safety i have asked the chairman of the transportation and infrastructure committee highways subcommittee to hold a hearing on this topic immediately when congress reconvenes in september our hearts go out to the west brook families here today the vietnamese community and the victims and families involved in last weeks tragedy in sherman and we will not stand for these tragedies to continue we must make the safety of our families a top priority

3511414 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3511415 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3511416 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
3511417 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment

3511421 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3511422 anybody who tells you they know when the housing market will bottom is delusional but anybody who denies there are some positives out there that could make the housing market bottom fairly soon is equally delusional
3511423 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3511424 california is the linchpin and so if the region flattens that changes everything
3511425 the data came in much better than we were expecting and much better than the market was expecting
3511426 i think a lot of the increase has to do with foreclosure sales which are selling at a quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time
3511427 housing market data is certainly showing early signs of stabilization on the activity side and home price side

3511433 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3511434 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3511508 we believe that 80 percent of women experience postpartum blues because of this effect of interleukin 1 beta if our hypothesis holds true lowering interleukin 1 beta levels may be a better treatment option
3511509 we enroll women who are without housing who are living from place to place we often see women who are medically high risk in combination with social and environmental challenges
3511510 we are thinking that one of the things that is missing immediately following delivery is the placenta and that this initiates a cascade of events leading to postpartum blues depression
3511511 competing for a share of a declining coal business coking coal shipped from palmer but mined in nearby durham bayne and occidental provided the company with the marketing edge it needed to survive the 1930s and the great depression
3511512 the early development of the puget sound area was built on natural resource industries such as fishing logging and coal mining production from washingtons coal mines peaked in 1918 coinciding with world war i competition from the introduction of california oil in the 1920s hydro electric dams in the 1930s and pipelines delivering natural gas in the 1950s all contributed to coals decline as a component of washingtons energy markets

3511517 youve got be open with things like that because most people want to be sheltered and not come out but him he did the standup type of thing which was address the team and move on
3511518 i mean the whole depression thing thats a serious matter
3511519 you want to hear his side of the story so to speak he came out and he expressed it and we all were sensitive to the fact that it is a sickness so to speak people go through it well just move on from here dont nobody here well me personally i dont dwell on things like that
3511520 you cant go through the whole training camp without having like a starter there
3511521 so i think next week is when hell start practicing and well just take it from there hes in good shape and i mean his spirits are high you all will see a big kid once he gets out there and gets his feet wet hell be fine
3511522 the offensive line we normally would have to be together a couple of weeks just to get the chemistry down but as far as game shape youve really got to go out here and actually participate in the plays like in the preseason games
3511523 a couple of guys were talking about it the other day we had our conditioning tests and everybody did a nice job but we come out here at practice and after seven or eight plays were gassed so theres a big difference between running shape and football shape

3511532 and like many people treated for depression they do not like the medication they take it some of the time and they dont take it some of the time we had warned her that a person in depression who felt they could not control anything any longer would sometimes go to extremes
3511533 he said he needed a change normally he was up and going he was a pretty good kid but when hed get depressed hed kind of stay to himself a little bit
3511534 he spoke with the subject he was there in the house by himself he found that there were no suicidal tendencies that he was in a very good mood very cordial very talkative the officer felt no further action needed to be taken
3511535 she had filed for divorce early last month and he and erica had been separated for a month she and the children were living in another location
3511536 we felt she was at risk and the children would be at risk if they were still there
3511537 theyre staying with us now were taking them to daycare
3511538 were telling them that mommy was in an accident and the doctors are making her feel better

3511625 the ofm fire investigation services team has not yet been able to access the area of origin it has been confirmed that asbestos was found throughout the area of the explosion a private contractor is in the process of cleaning up the area block by block to ensure the safety of everyone at the scene
3511626 once the asbestos has been removed the ofm will be in a position to carry on with its investigation as the point of origin at this time the investigation is focused on documenting the debris and assess the extent of the damage
3511627 i dont believe they should be operating there it doesnt take a rocket scientist to determine you shouldnt have 220 000 litres of propane next to a residential community

3511640 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3511641 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3511642 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3511643 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3511644 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3511645 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3511646 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3511647 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3511648 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3511649 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3511650 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3511651 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3511652 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3511653 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are

3511728 in 2005 the situation was completely different he ould vall was at the helm of a coup that brought a 21 year dictatorship to an end and that received the tacit support of the international community but now you have a situation where the coup plotters have overthrown a legitimate government
3511729 he may well have thought that he could have gotten away with it he may well have thought the military had been out of power for 18 months but he may have overestimated how much support he had he certainly overestimated how much support he had within his own party many of whom are very close to the military

3511762 the social democratic tradition has great achievements to its credit in the uk notably in health and welfare but on its own traditional social democracy is not enough we need the second progressive tradition the radical liberal tradition can teach social democrats the importance of individual lives and stories in the overall pattern of the good society it speaks to the civilian surge the social democrat can teach the radical liberal that without social justice there is no freedom it speaks to collective insecurity

3511814 from the standpoint of a confidence thing the guys never give up and being able to play together so long theyve been in so many battles they never get down they never think theyre out of the game so thats a plus
3511815 its basically the same team we had two years ago in juniors competition the experience factor definitely helps us a lot

3511830 the veterans of foreign wars continues to totally support its troops whether they are involved in war or hostile action it is not our place as officers of the veterans of foreign wars to get involved in the political arena

3511842 the first principle of prayer is to be yourself prayer is being yourself before god this may sound obvious but it bears a little developing how do you learn to talk with or be with another human being do you begin completely ignorant and have to learn every step of a proper procedure or are the instincts and inclinations already in place so that you can begin easily enough and grow in facility through experience a lot of prayer is defeated by pseudo ideals one ready way to misconceive it is to think of it as making something beautiful for god you will think good and holy thoughts you will have warm and loving feelings you seek a religious experience you have no religious experience instead god seems distant and disinterested and you struggle to make contact felling alone and rejected the problem is not really personal failure but pseudo ideals prayer is not making something beautiful for god or having god make something beautiful for you or getting into a separate space where your life cannot touch you all the living models of prayer we have considered show us that prayer is rather being yourself before god coming as you are not putting on a face and manufacturing appropriate thoughts and feelings but being yourself and working with the thoughts and feelings that are there

3511844 postures are concerned not really with any kind of physiological training but an inner training of being learning just to be
3511845 the postures of meditation should embody steadiness and ease this occurs as all effort relaxes and coalescence arises revealing that the body and the infinite universe are indivisible then one is no longer disturbed by the play of opposites
3511846 the true contemplative is not one who prepares his mind for a particular message that he wants or expects to hear but is one who remains empty because he knows that he can never expect to anticipate the words that will transform his darkness into light

3511848 i think ricky made all the difference in the world
3511849 his defensive presence was spectacular the guards from china couldnt get the ball past half court and that changed the face of the game
3511850 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3511851 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3511852 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3511853 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3511854 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3511860 if you ask americans of any political persuasion conservative liberal or moderate whether theyd rather see us lead the world with allies or alone most people instinctively say were better off with allies
3511861 the public does understand that something is not right about our policies today
3511862 cause were gonna fight in fancy dresses while riding in a limo
3511863 we met in one of the most awkward ways possible
3511864 he ran me over with a golf cart when i was eight
3511865 not my woods they beong to mother nature im just a bit suprised as to why youre out in weather like this looks like a storms coming
3511866 i told you my story maybe its about time i heard yours
3511867 wir erhielten eine einladung von arabischen parlamenten und waren berrascht als gypten der delegation die ausreise verweigerte
3511868 youre so stupid sean god how could i trust you with that much money
3511869 i had ideas about transforming it when i first became cio
3511870 but the environment wasnt aligned in a way where i could launch on these ideas
3511871 what we had prior to that was some configurations of corporate it structure but we didnt have the business side what we call the mission side really fully engaged in big decisions about how we spent our money on it how we deal with information policies and things like that
3511872 demanded that because of the problems weve had in the past because of who actually participated in making it decisions he said to the business leaders the mission managers you will sit at the table
3511873 so the support of the top leadership has been very important in making sure that board is effective
3511874 were making corporate policies on how data is going to be managed and were not going to allow little fiefdoms anymore
3511875 where data is managed and protected and policy and regulations are set by some local manager at the lowest levels of the organization
3511876 a lot of things are related to turf and how much you own and control
3511877 what were doing in effect is were taking some of that control away and that always hurts and thats why it makes it difficult because you are pushing out a culture that existed for many years
3511878 trident allows analysts to spend less time trying to find relevant information and more time analyzing
3511879 the number of people looking over your shoulder is staggering
3511880 the problem with that is that it became so bureaucratic
3511881 we were having projects taking dozens of control gates each of which could have hundreds of people in a room it was not an efficient way of getting the job done
3511882 when it comes to managing big projects the feds have this terrible oversight problem and when anything goes wrong they add another oversight layer
3511883 if youve got us 100 million to 200 million project the number of meetings and oversight and people looking over your shoulder is staggering
3511884 could evaluate some of the basic management functions that we now evaluate throughout other parts of the federal government such as human capital acquisition information technology strategic planning organizational alignment and financial and knowledge management
3511885 we foresee no major change in limits on our access
3511886 secrecy makes it hard to really know whats going on
3511887 you know one of the things we do here is we commit espionage thats the business were in
3511888 because information that sits here and no one uses is worthless
3511889 despite decades of trying to reduce the barriers between the directorate of intelligence di and the directorate of operations do sharp divides still exist
3511890 the di and the do for example have separate databases and separate it architectures several di analysts even told me that they had a better working relationship with their counterparts at nsa than with their own cia colleagues in the do
3511891 the cia has never been able to get their ops guys to talk to the analytic guys because the ops guys basically know that if the data and names get out people die
3511892 they guard their information very closely and the analytic guys want to make everything public in the community that tension is there across the board
3511893 technology is not the barrier for making them work more effectively
3511894 heres the rub he can bring all the efficiencies here but its difficult because of our unique security requirements
3511895 twenty years ago if you didnt want to use technology you didnt have to
3511896 information sharing is critical but at the same time we need to have some cylinders of excellence
3511897 so there you have al tarasiuk the cio trying to figure out all right what do i balance here
3511898 its not a one size fits all and its not one solution
3511899 create a culture that would rather avoid the risk and not fail than try and fail and learn from the failure and succeed the next time around
3511900 the cia is a really good example of an organization where theres not a lot of tolerance for failure but we have to be in the position where were willing to try new things and risk failure that we can learn from and help us get it right later

3511907 i want to make sure that there is a spot open for me at the school i want to go to i talked to pitt assistant coach tom herrion and he said they were recruiting a lot of guards in my class and that it was best not to wait i love pitt im not saying im going to go there but if thats my choice then i have to do it now my high school coach and aau coach agree with me
3511908 i just want to get it over with to be honest
3511909 i get so many calls from coaches and so much mail and im already kind of sick of it and its only going to get worse

3511979 we are pleased to report record sales and gross profit for the quarter this is encouraging especially as economic factors such as decreased miles driven and escalating raw material and energy costs continue to challenge our company we have been successful in offsetting these variables by savings achieved through our restructuring efforts and a continued focus on operational expense reductions
3511980 we continue to expand our global capabilities as we pursue our objective of becoming a world class manufacturer and distributor of on and off highway replacement products and services our recent announcements regarding our plan to acquire 85 percent of longkou haimeng machining company limited in china the establishment of a greenfield brake manufacturing and distribution facility in mexico along with previously announced greenfield operations in ukraine and india clearly reinforce and support our globalization and transformation strategy the addition of these operations will provide us with world class manufacturing capabilities while enhancing our market access for growth around the world
3511981 we truly appreciate the efforts and support that ed heil has provided his contributions have been invaluable to the board and to the operation of the company and he will be sorely missed
3511982 this past quarter we had many operational and corporate successes which unfortunately were offset by the failure of the main gibraltar transformer although the ramp up of gibraltars phase i expansion has proven to be more challenging than originally anticipated our operations team is continuing to make good progress towards achieving the interim design capacity of 46 000 tons per day
3511983 our focus has not changed the gibraltar expansion projects are on time and on budget and we are increasing production as quickly as possible to capitalize on the continued copper market strength the prosperity team is moving ahead with engineering and procurement given the provincial governments recent decision to move prosperity into the environmental assessment review taseko is in an ideal position with near medium and long term production growth from its 100 wholly owned assets
3511984 remote sensing technology which makes it possible to collect data on dangerous or inaccessible areas has gained prominence in recent years due to technological advances
3511985 this technology coupled with space and airborne imaging along with joint cooperation between authorities on both sides of the border can be used to protect both countries against organized crime money laundering and drug human and illegal arms trafficking although traditional border crossings have been tightened up since the 9 11 attacks criminals are now seeking easier access points
3511986 we were recently awarded a new 1 4 million contract by the saskatoon health region to supply and install our specialized furniture and equipment at certain long term care facilities in saskatchewan the contract will be completed in the third quarter of 2008 and we are confident we will continue to win additional contract awards as and when they are announced by provincial governments across the country
3511987 we are very pleased to have opened our new showroom in the kitchener waterloo region this is central in the province of ontario and will allow us to showcase our furniture and equipment offering in a location that is convenient for our customers in this region
3511988 we are very excited to be bringing dismeds customers people products and facilities into the futuremed family we will combine our product lines and expertise with dismeds strong reputation and market presence to increase our quebec business and extend into eastern canadian markets furthermore the acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to distributable cash in the range of 8 to 10
3511989 the funds portfolio performed in line with expectations which reflects the diversity stability and quality of our power and social infrastructure assets
3511990 the fund continued to benefit from increased power production and higher power rates as well as predictable results from leisureworld moreover the funds financial position remains strong which will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities that contribute to the long term value of the portfolio
3511991 demand for the services provided by essential infrastructure assets is inelastic which means they deliver predictable performance throughout the economic cycle this stability is what makes infrastructure so compelling to investors seeking to diversify their portfolios
3511992 the funds outlook for the balance of fiscal 2008 is positive in addition we have substantial financial capacity for growth and are actively reviewing a range of opportunities our goal is to build a significant diversified portfolio of infrastructure assets that returns exceptional long term value to unitholders

3512006 health officials argue that raw milk can carry dangerous pathogens such as e coli listeria salmonella and campylobacter bugs that are killed by pasteurization

3512034 non so se ci sia stata correttezza assoluta da parte di tutti quanti so di guardare in faccia una persona e poterla guardare dritta negli occhi senza avere difficolt e se c qualcuno che abbassa lo sguardo perch in difetto non certo il sottoscritto
3512035 sicuramente ha aggiunto c stato molto di eccessivo ci sono stati anche fraintendimenti e situazioni poco chiare forse le cose sono state molto accelerate e mi aspettavo qualcosa di diverso nei modi mi piace molto la schiettezza e quindi il fatto di non scendere mai o poco a compromessi probabilmente non mi ha aiutato
3512036 we need a game plan for bringing parking technology into the 21st century in all five boroughs
3512037 muni meters and pay by phone systems increase parking availability and allow drivers to pay by credit cards so that people dont have to keep their piggy banks in their glove compartments
3512038 muni meters provide for more parking spaces than do parking meters
3512039 as everyone knows parking spaces are in demand i am also enthusiastic about this bill because it provides for an additional innovative way to purchase a muni meter ticket use your cell phone as payment system congratulations to council member felder
3512040 the policy of the united states towards cuba is driven by american interests to come and say that its not a concession to provide fidel castro with additional resources at a time when cuba and venezuela are playing such a significant role in organizing and orchestrating against the united states in latin america i think is missing the whole picture
3512041 through the us embargo we have denied resources to a regime that has declared itself from the very beginning an enemy of the us and that has shown that any time they do have resources they will use them for means that are not in the interest of the us whether it be overseas guerrilla groups or terrorist organizations or wars in africa but one thing we will never know is what would fidel castro have been like and what damage would he have done had he had resources and thats something we have prevented through our policy
3512042 so the presidents policy has always been to support the people of cuba but not to support the regime and we recognize that anything we do to support the regime anything we do to help them will just cement their power and their ability to repress the cuban people now i will say this that we the us today supply about one third of cubas food and medicine the second source of revenue in cuba is remittances from cuban americans in miami so ironically we have helped them more than we will ever get credit for but were not looking for that but we have helped them a lot throughout the years
3512043 cement their power and their ability to repress the cuban people
3512044 at least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort
3512045 among the various weapons of mass destruction biological warfare bw is perhaps the most difficult to clearly identify absent unambiguous reliable intelligence information owing to the dual use nature of the technology and materials used to support a bw program in todays world many nations including cuba have in place robust biotechnology infrastructures as some of the worlds best scientific talent has turned to this avenue of modern science to promote medical and agricultural advances in their countries
3512046 the nature of biological weapons makes it difficult to procure clear incontrovertible proof that a country is engaged in the illicit biological weapons research production weaponization and stockpiling cubas sophisticated denial and deception practices make our task even more difficult that said we have a sound basis for our judgment that cuba has at least a limited developmental offensive biological warfare research and development effort
3512047 concluded that it is no longer clear that cuba has an active offensive bio weapons program

3512053 please note that admission to public post secondary educational institutions is not one of the benefits regulated by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996

3512055 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot thats not quite in
3512056 russia is going to have to ensure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3512057 i dont think that there is any doubt that this action that russia has taken and the way in which they have taken it will have an impact on how russia is viewed but i dont want to get ahead of ourselves
3512058 the official would not address whether the us and europe want to push russia out of the g8 they say right now they are focused on resolving the conflict with georgia

3512072 the impact of russian actions goes beyond their threat to a democratic georgia
3512073 russia has used violence against georgia to send a signal to any country that chooses to associate with the west and aspire to our shared political and economic values my friends we learned a great cost of the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked with our allies we must stand in united purpose to persuade the russian government to withdraw its troops from georgia
3512074 the thoughts and the prayers and support of the american people are with that brave little nation as they struggle for their freedom and independence
3512075 and he wanted me to say thank you to you to give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people for this tiny little democracy far away from the united states of america

3512088 tittsworth shows with conviction that he doesnt just recycle songs he creates them the verdict tittsworth should be proud twelve steps is at its end a mighty accomplishment for both its maker and his genre
3512089 finally tittsworth crafted a debut that will prove his skills on the production end twelve steps is a trip through a land of gritty breaks dirty lyrics and plenty of guest appearances fun is the first priority here and in that area not to mention numerous others tittsworth more than succeeds
3512090 tittsworth provides a vivid and vicariously fun illustration of the exploits of clubbing 12 steps entertains throughout because tittsworth keeps his dj ethos of changing up the styles quickly and often
3512091 with the whole world going bmore crazy its surprising that this niche sub genre hasnt produced more albums but right on cue heres the notable producer tittsworth weighing in with the aggy and excellent twelve steps

3512128 la diferencia entre literatura y periodismo el periodismo es ilegible y la literatura no se lee

3512130 hoy parece que le basta a la gente con ser vulgar injusta fr vola o viciosa para tener una asombrosa infinidad de derechos con los cuales ni so aron los buenos de sus antepasados
3512131 en la poca est pida que vivimos lo m s extravagante es un hombre con cerebro el vulgo se burla de l
3512132 no siempre es posible juzgar a un hombre por sus obras puede respetar la ley y aun as ser despreciable puede romperla y a n as ser admirable
3512133 jam s se debe confiar en una mujer que confiesa su verdadera edad si es capaz de decir eso es capaz de todo
3512134 en este mundo s lo hay dos tragedias una es no conseguir lo que se desea y la otra es conseguirlo

3512149 aber wer hat je das gesetz gemacht das ehepartner liebende sein m ssen kommen sie im alltag gut zurecht und leben sie harmonisch zusammen dann muss es keine liebe sein die sie verbindet in fr heren jahrhunderten ging man nicht davon aus das zwischen ehepartnern liebe herrschen w rde liebe wurde eher au erhalb der ehe gesehen
3512150 wenn m nner und frauen also in einer festen beziehung stecken die f r das erste gesetzt ist und an dessen bestand niemand r ttelt wie kann liebe gl ck und erf llung in die herzen einziehen und wie k nnen beide partner zu einer erf llten sexualit t finden
3512151 ist das nicht die quadratur des kreises wie kann es erf llung ohne liebe geben
3512152 du willst s sein oder nett das hilft hier aber alles gar nichts denn das ideal der b rgerlichen liebe das ist eine auf l ngere zeit angelegtes gef hl wir schauen hier aber nicht in die zukunft die keiner kennen kann jedenfalls nicht mit den mitteln die dir zur zeit zu gebote stehen wir reden von einem moment jetzt und in diesem moment k nnen wir uns verlieben oder hassen lernen es liegt an uns was wir aus diesem moment machen und zwei partner die sich im moment f r einander entscheiden k nnen und d rfen ihre momentane liebe entdecken die doch nie eine gr ere zukunft hat als jetzt stelle dir doch einmal das gef hl der liebe entfrachtet vor ohne den verwaltungsaufwand des morgens welche b rokratie des aufrechnens ich habe dir viermal zugel chelt das hei t ich liebe dich aber bei zweimal f hle ich mich vernachl ssigt
3512153 grunds tzlich gilt das ego des mannes und die b rgerliche liebe sind monstren der verwaltung von besitz alles wird aus der zukunft begr ndet und soll uns im moment ber unsere wahren und intensiven gef hle wegt uschen jeder mensch kann jeden lieben und es ist nichts schlecht daran in einem moment liebe mit einem menschen zu erleben der vielleicht dem irrtum oder einem wahn von einem m nnlichen ego verfallen ist solange er in diesem moment lieben kann ist alles andere spekulation
3512154 schauen wir uns doch mal diese gef hle an die wahren gef hle die gattung mensch will berleben und sie hat die fortpflanzung im akt der zeugung mit lust besetzt wie clever der moment ist st rker als die vorausschau wenn ich m nner sehe dann sehe ich in ihnen den befehl kinder zu zeugen jeden tag wollen sie ein kind zeugen das mag mit der grund sein warum man m nnern nachsagt sie seien sehr stark von ihrem geschlechtstrieb gesteuert eine frau die sexualpartner sucht und nur auf den moment schaut wird deswegen genug sexualpartner finden k nnen
3512155 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini and shamala revisited
3512156 really cause such confusion amongst our ministers amongst the umno pas and pkr leaders and amongst the self proclaimed muslim student leaders
3512157 we recognise and respect article 121 1a however there is a strong viewpoint that it is unjust to compel anyone to be subjected to laws and courts that are based on a religion that they do not profess and this viewpoint must be addressed although open to everyone ragunath said they were taking the necessary precautions to ensure that the dialogue took place in a controlled and constructive manner by holding it in a closed setting and by requiring participants to register for the event per se as the bar council endorses the absolute right of individuals to embrace islam instead the forum will address the ancillary issues that arise from such situations and will emphasise the need for laws and a judicial system that protects everyone equally

3512167 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3512168 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3512169 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3512170 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3512171 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3512172 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3512173 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3512174 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3512182 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3512183 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3512184 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3512311 the history of the twentieth air forces campaign to bomb japanese cities reflects some critical truths about modern conflicts in general and the second world war in particular first the u s in 1945 was a prisoner of great industrial decisions taken years earlier in quite different strategic circumstances in 1942 the commitment to build the b 29 long range bomber was entirely rational the programme reached technological maturity and large scale production too late to make a decisive impact on the war yet it was asking far too much of the u s never mind of its senior airmen to forgo the use of these aircraft at a time when the enemy was still resisting fiercely and killing many americans in the circumstances then prevailing an essential caveat for any historian to emphasise the b 29s were bound to be employed when precision bombing failed as continued to be the case even when attempted under lemays direction in the spring of 1945 the cities of japan were doomed to suffer the same fate as those of germany rather than the will of commanders it was the existence of a specific weapons system the b 29 superfortress bomber which impelled the incineration of several hundred thousand japanese
3512312 the key point about the roles of both harris air chief marshall for britains raf and lemay is that they were subordinate officers not supreme commanders each was the servant of a democracy and of its elaborate military and political hierarchy the washington administration was scarcely oblivious of what american bombers were doing to japan if churchill roosevelt or truman together with their respective chiefs of staff perceived it as morally wrong to slaughter the civilian populations of germany and japan then it was their function to decree otherwise and if necessary to change the responsible commanders they did not choose to do this they acquiesced in even if they did not enthuse about what was done to the enemy in the names of their nations they rather than lemay or harris must bear historic responsibility
3512313 for posterity perhaps most important is to perceive lemays bombing campaign as setting the stage creating the moral and strategic climate for hiroshima and nagasaki a recent study has observed nobody involved in the decision on the atomic bombs could have seen themselves as setting new precedents for mass destruction in scale only in efficiency like sir arthur harris curtis lemay remained impenitent to the end after the war he shrugged nothing new about death nothing new about deaths caused militarily we scorched and boiled and baked to death more people in tokyo on that night of 9 10 march than went up in vapor at hiroshima and nagasaki combined
3512314 it was one of two war crimes with which i can be charged
3512315 you really dont know the effects of what you are doing we the air crews didnt know we thought we were hitting things and the people even farther removed than us didnt know the whole business was cloaked in denial
3512316 in february 1945 american bombers reduced this treasure the city of dresden to crushed stone and embers disemboweled her with high explosives and cremated with incendiaries
3512317 i screamed and i wept and i clawed the walls of our shelter
3512318 i prayed to go to please please please dear god stop them but he didnt hear me no power could stop them on they came wave after wave there was no way we could surrender no way to tell them we couldnt stand it anymore there was nothing anyone could do but sit and wait for morning
3512319 nothing in the district had escaped the fury a city of jagged building shells of splintered statuary and shattered trees every vehicle stopped gnarled and burned left to rust or rot in the path of the frenzied might the only sounds other than our own were those of falling plaster and their echoes i cannot describe the desolation properly our ghoulish mission was to search for bodies it was rich hunting that day and the many thereafter we started on a small scale here a leg there an arm and an occasional baby but struck a mother lode before noon we cut our way through a basement wall to discover a reeking hash of over one hundred human beings it is with some regret that i here besmirch the nobility of our airmen but boys you killed an appalling lot of women and children the shelter i described and innumerable other like it were filled with them burned alive suffocated crushed men women and children indiscriminately killed for all the sublimity of the cause for which we fought we surely created a belsen concentration camp of our own the method was impersonal but the result was equally cruel and heartless that i am afraid is a sickening truth
3512320 there can be no doubt that the allies fought on the side of right and the germans and japanese on the side of wrong
3512321 the frightening thing about such acts of renaming or euphemism is their power to efface the memory of actual cruelties
3512322 it is right for us to be on the offense against islamofascism and not wait until they attack us on our soil unlike any war we have ever fought in this nation this is not a war for soil it is a war for our soul we will either win it or we will lose it this nation must rally to the point where we recognize there is no compromise there is no alternative we must win they must lose islamofascism must disappear from the face of the earth or we will
3512323 nothing can excuse acts of terrorism which are aimed at civilians or those acts of state terror in which planned civilian deaths are advertised as collateral damage yet the uniformity of the presentation by the mass media after 2001 to the effect that the united states now faced threats arising from a fanaticism with religious roots unconnected to anything america had done or could do betrayed a stupefying abdication of judgment the protective silence regarding the 725 american bases worldwide and the emotions with which these are regarded by the people who live in their shadow cover up a clue in the fact that fifteen of the nineteen hijackers on september 11 were saudis the presence of thousands of american troops on arabian soil was hotly resented to gloss over or ignore such facts only obstructs an intelligent discussion of the reaction likely to follow from any extended american occupation of the middle east
3512324 members of these groups now total nearly 80 000 and are paid 300 of u s taxpayer money a month to not attack occupation forces thats 24 million a month in reality most of the sahwa are resistance fighters who are taking the money arms and ammunition whilst biding their time to build their forces to move once again against the occupation forces which now support them in addition to planning to move against the shia dominated government furthermore it is widely known in iraq that many of the sahwa are al qaeda members the irony of which is not lost to iraqis who heard the u s propaganda as to the reasons the sahwa were formed to drive al qaeda from iraq and to promote security so as to enable political reconciliation within the government in baghdad by providing the space for this to occur
3512325 arming the sunni while politically supporting the shia how is that promoting reconciliation
3512326 baghdad is better than it was but the improvement is only in comparison to the bloodbath of 2006 when 3 000 people were being killed every month baghdad is entirely divided between sunni and shia and the sectarianism is as deep seated as it was before the fall in violence in many areas say iraqis bitterly the killing stopped because there was nobody left to kill there are very few mixed neighborhoods left
3512327 we were very encouraged by our visit to iraq that the surge is succeeding and in the reduction in u s casualties but it is complicated by the iranian involvement in iraq and syrians continue to expedite the flow of foreign fighters in iraq
3512328 at the end of the day neither sunni nor shia arabs in iraq want the us to stay
3512329 it would be very easy for any of the myriad armed groups in iraq to launch an offensive and send american military casualties soaring with the rise of al sahwa a powerful sunni militia the country is more divided than ever the sunni now have their own private army thanks to the us surge as do the shia and the kurds
3512330 normally when america goes to war nonessential spending programs are reduced to make room in the budget for the higher costs of the war individual programs that benefit specific constituencies are sacrificed for the common good and taxes have
3512331 to offset that depressing effect the fed has flooded the economy with liquidity and the regulators looked the other way when very imprudent lending was going up
3512332 we were living on borrowed money and borrowed time and eventually a day of reckoning had to come and it has now come
3512333 when americas financial institutions had a problem they had to turn to the sovereign wealth funds in the middle east for recapitalization for the bailout the reason was obvious
3512334 the war had led to high oil prices the war had meant that america had to borrow more money there werent sources of liquid funds in the united states the sources of the liquid funds were in the middle east
3512335 we fear the cold and the things we do not understand but most of all we fear the secret misdoings of the heedless ones among ourselves

3512342 the united states has reached the 85 billion mark in spending on contractors in iraq since the invasion in 2003 according to a new government report released tuesday a milestone that reflects the bush administrations unprecedented level of dependence on private companies for help in the war
3512343 the report by the congressional budget office says that about one out of every five dollars spent on the war in iraq has gone to contractors for the u s military and other government agencies employees of private contractors now outnumber u s troops in the war zone
3512344 the pentagons reliance on outside contractors in iraqis proportionately far larger than in any previous conflict and it has fueled charges that this outsourcing has led to overbilling fraud and shoddy and unsafe work that has endangered and even killed u
3512345 contractors now employ at least 180 000 people in iraq forming what amounts to a private army larger than the u s military force whose roles and missions and even casualties have largely been hidden from public view
3512346 the widespread use of these employees as bodyguards translators drivers construction workers and cooks has allowed the administration of president george w bush to hold down the number of military personnel sent to iraq helping to avoid a draft

3512351 its a swizz the way you can turn back time this is very clearly a contradiction in potter why doesnt potter save his parents or kill voldy i mean come on this one of the finest schoolboy errors ive ever seen
3512352 the superintendents have a greater comfort level with preemployment testing than random drug testing of teachers most superintendents believed that the drug problem among teachers was not large enough to warrant action but many reserved the right to revisit the implementation of such policies if the circumstances in their school district changed
3512353 public servants police firemen etc certainly should be random drug tested
3512354 it is easier to subject the unknown person to drug testing than to subject that same person to drug testing once he or she has become one of us because most superintendents did not believe that there was a drug problem with their current professional employees there was no sense in disturbing the status quo
3512355 to test or not to test drug testing teachers the view of the superintendent
3512356 when i heard that my dancing for five minutes while wearing a jeans and t shirt in the prom party caused such offence i was shocked

3512359 i see no hope or future for belly dancing in egypt
3512360 ten years ago we were so many each one had her own style and audience whether first class belly dancers or second and third class now i look around and see nobody
3512361 i think the problem some have with belly dancing here is the dancing costume but it has always been seductive like this we our generation didnt invent it like ballet can the ballerina dance with a different outfit we too cant dance with our bodies covered
3512362 if i had a daughter i would advise her not to become a belly dancer
3512363 i surround myself with people who love dancing and who are very understanding so i dont get the feeling that im doing something wrong at all
3512364 but when these problems happen from time to time its a reminder that many people look down on dancing and that its seen as shameful
3512365 most of the brides are veiled but they dont stop dancing with me and their groom all night long for egyptians who can afford it a wedding means a belly dancer
3512366 of course i would never imagine myself being a belly dancer
3512367 but i had dina at my wedding that was a dream come true
3512368 at my wedding i slaughtered sheep and distributed to the poor by the same amount of money that i would have paid to a belly dancer
3512369 i think god would bless a marriage that begins by feeding the poor not wasting money on belly dancers
3512370 belly dancing is in our blood its deeply rooted in our soil
3512371 baron pierre de coubertins slogan the important thing in life is not to triumph but to compete is not on our minds

3512391 we had been through several inspections they were all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change

3512415 the new oceanic beta and the new na ce closed beta servers will be at a different stage of testing than the non oceanic servers to allow the oceanic players to play the tier 1 3 content while the rest of the closed beta testers are currently playing in tier 4 this is because the oceanic ce players need to play the game at the lower tiers before they go to the higher tiers which they will be able to do down the road if you are currently in the beta and a ce purchaser your status will not change i figure someone will ask me that and you can stay where you are

3512425 it is clear to me that the people posting about how monogamy is unnatural and how people can be happily poly amorous have never been on the receiving end of the news that their spouse has had an affair or seen the absolute devastation it can wreak on a family if an open marriage works for you kudos to you i think thats awesome it doesnt work for everyone though and i find it rather insensitive to gloss over how absolutely heartbreaking it is to find out that your spouse has cheated on you with no thought for your feelings or health it is a much much different ball of wax then a mutually agreed upon open marriage and it should never ever be compared to one whether you think its a natural relationship or not doesnt impact the result on the betrayed spouse

3512443 i like how the team and ultimately our program continues to establish new standards and make progress we have an ambitious and passionate group that is set on breaking new ground we lost some key individuals last fall but the response of the group and the way in which our players have progressed throughout the spring has me excited for a new season it will be a fun team to watch and coach as we grow together the sky is truly the limit the members of our team have a great competitiveness and maturity about them and coupled with the staff changes the energy has been great we have battles for playing time all over the field and that depth will be tested and needed with the schedule ahead ive been looking forward to the start of the new season for awhile now and cant wait for it to finally get going
3512444 this is not the first time we find ourselves replacing a record breaking goalkeeper the battle for the new no 1 is going to be fun to watch under jason goodsons direction and with some new training ideas i am intrigued to see how both lindsay and stephanie develop lindsay came in with great pedigree pushed last fall for playing time and has set a high standard for herself it has been great to see her blossom in confidence stephanie joins us from an elite program and team that has performed on the biggest stages and won you dont do that without a good goalkeeper the options are bright for the team and i believe we have two individuals that can further the tradition of great keepers here at washington state
3512445 every great team is built around a solid defense we have lost a leader in allison scurich but the stability provided by those returning and the freshness of our new additions will make this a group that is more than capable of setting new standards they are going to be tested from the start and i am intrigued to see who steps forward to lead and marshal the backline opportunity is there and i am excited about the options and different qualities that we have in this group from great ball winners and tacklers to players capable of being dangerous in the attack
3512446 this group is going to have to be the core that sets the tone standards and one that drives the team to new heights we return players who have performed and tasted success and now take the reigns i am excited to see how this pushes the team to new levels of success we have added a variety of players who come from winning backgrounds and that will allow us to play in a variety of styles i have been pleased with the discipline of this group and the fact that we are seeing goals from them is a great addition and great dynamic to have in our team
3512447 oh no its 8am i cant even take a shower and now im going to be late for work

3512451 let me draw you the graphic gory image dark hair olive complexion italian heritage wearing an ash gray sweatsuit set yes i repeat the set shirt tucked into pants nonetheless on top of this atrocity he dons a camel colored sport coat blazer thing and just to make sure i never regain use of my retinas he has the white and navy blue new balance sneakers on needless to say everyone wanted to see his id they did not believe he was a doctor my lawyer just hung his head and for a lawyer to be at a loss for words not good why you ask why would a man with an extensive education and strong moral fiber go to such lengths to inflict this type of visual carnage his reason for wearing the blazer was that the sweatsuit didnt have any pockets you know for the important items people need to carry to an important legal event like a closing as he explained this i stood there with my eyes bugging out and my mouth ajar so as if the blazer sweatpant combo wasnt enough also the pockets of said blazer had to be stuffed and lumpy he looked like a hobo whod just shoplifted items from a nearby 711
3512452 im trying to keep my expression normal but you just totally freaked me out
3512453 its not that things are looking better for the us its things are just looking bad elsewhere

3512456 like an endangered rain forest the bay area microclimates that still enjoy home price appreciation are shrinking just six months ago areas where median home values were still on the upswing were bigger and more widespread the entire bay area is correcting for the frothiness in the markets that occurred from 2003 to 2006 where by all rational economic accounts the market was outpacing what youd normally expect to see said stan humphries vp of data and analytics for zillow
3512457 in the beginning of 2000 the aggregate home value in the nine county region was just a touch less than 381 000 it peaked in the second quarter of 2005 at slightly less than 686 000 now its at 563 288 near its level in mid 2004
3512458 one trouble spot shown by zillows figures is that more than half of the people who bought bay area homes in 2005 and 2006 are under water owing more than their home is worth of people who bought in 2007 there are 41 1 percent who are under water
3512459 home values in the east bay eroded at a faster rate during the spring than they did in the early months of 2008 during the second quarter of 2008 home values plunged on a year to year basis by 25 6 percent in contra costa county and by 18 9 percent in alameda county according to zillow com
3512460 the second quarters deterioration in home values exceeded the year to year declines that occurred in the first quarter of 2008 in the january march period home values fell by 23 percent in contra costa county and 16 8 percent in alameda county zillow reported
3512461 the rates of decline in home values are accelerating and that tells us we are not near a bottom yet said amy bohutinsky zillows director of communications
3512462 the east bay market with the worst year to year decline in home values is the antioch zip code of 94531 where values have nose dived by 38 3 percent
3512463 perhaps the biggest factor in the east bay housing market is the effect that sales of previously foreclosed homes are having on residential property values for example in antioch about 75 percent of the homes being actively listed for sale are bank owned residences with foreclosed mortgages according to a survey conducted by real estate consultant don morton
3512464 the good news is these foreclosed homes are selling morton said
3512465 credit repair specialist hannah fliegel of corte madera helped people remove the stain of foreclosure from credit reports for months before realizing she could do more
3512466 fliegel has received several hundred inquiries about this months workshop after a mailing to homeowners of distressed properties across the bay area

3512542 it is important to establish that forced disappearance must contain several elements but at the very least the direct or indirect participation of the authorities as well as the subsequent denial that they were involved this distinguishes forced disappearance from the crime of kidnapping
3512543 involves a period of uncertainty regarding the fate of the victim after the abduction and in many cases that uncertainty is never cleared up
3512544 basically because it is a more complex crime the implementation of which also involves a chain of crimes and it is committed exclusively at the initiative of the government through its agents whether military or civilian
3512545 in the history of human rights abuses disappearances are not new but the systematic and reiterated manner in which they have been used as a weapon designed to bring about not only the actual disappearance of certain persons but to generate a generalised state of anxiety and insecurity is a relatively recent development

3512618 the ball was in play for 39 minutes in the sydney test against the all blacks last year the average was 25 or 26 minutes so it requires a different kind of athlete it also requires some astute substituting its something we needed to learn
3512619 we were simply out thought by robbie deans in the sydney test he had something like 20 games experience whereas we had just two under the elvs we have since been trying to get it right
3512620 we learned a lot from the sydney situation we had to put our heads together to come up wit a different strategy but we cant play against south africa the same way we played against australia
3512621 it doesnt matter how much possession you have its how you use it
3512622 with the new sanctions at the breakdown you also dont want to be caught in possession too often and then the free kick can often give the momentum to the opposing team
3512623 thats why we see a lot more kicking under the new laws it gives the attacking team the opportunity to put more pressure on the other team
3512624 the all blacks beat the springboks in that series 3 1 after losing a series in 1949 everybody felt proud again after beating the boks

3512626 the global focus on china is an opportunity for people who believe their plight is ignored and invisible to take action
3512627 the concern here is that at a minimum this is going to add volatility to the region and polarize the uighur and chinese communities
3512628 there is also a fear the government will launch a widespread indiscriminate repressive campaign targeted far beyond the groups advocating use of violence
3512629 we can see that the attackers are merciless fugitives so the government should be on high alert
3512630 because they cannot carry out such attacks in their most desirable cities like beijing they have to turn to local locations
3512631 their methods are quite similar to some other international terrorist attacks
3512632 it is deeply concerning that we have a found a child of this age with a weapon that we believe is capable of firing
3512633 whilst the number of shootings has been reducing todays arrest just demonstrates that we are not complacent
3512634 we will continue to target anyone who is under the misapprehension that carrying a gun is a good idea
3512635 having a gun even if it isnt used in a shooting or crime is being dealt with incredibly seriously by the met police
3512636 ebay members must adhere to strict rules and regulations when listing items for sale

3512650 with the injuries and stuff at our place we as players can all raise the bar a little bit with us missing out by two points in the premiership and in the champions league i think they know that every year were going to give them a good run for their money weve been very close to them weve had injuries changes of manager i think we can close the gap hopefully if we can keep players fit early on and around the christmas period as well well do well
3512651 we need to get off to a flyer and keep winning
3512652 our start cost us the league last season so we need to start well
3512653 it hurt seeing them winning the trophy at wigan its frustrating i can sit here and give them credit but it doesnt get any easier we made that trophy ours when mourinho first took over we obviously want that back
3512654 of course i want the england captaincy id be mad to sit here and say no
3512655 ive been awfully lucky to get the armband in the past and thats something that will never leave me im sure whoever mr capello announces as the captain will have the best day of his life next week whether it be myself rio stevie g or lamps the main thing is that england as a team move forward and the captain helps drag them together

3512680 working together with all stakeholders we can produce a bond proposal that will address the needs of all students of the hart district protect the integrity of taxes dollars and be successful when presented to the voters
3512681 we are not against funding facilities for our childrens education we want to make sure we have enough this time and we do it right with the proper safeguards
3512682 our organization is interested in helping the board of the hart district to become familiar with the process of due diligence we believe that the next bond measure that comes before the citizens of this valley should be better planned to ensure that projects are completed on time and within the original budget
3512683 no podemos descartarlo lo cierto es que se usaron armas de grueso calibre
3512684 el director t cnico ha hecho una lista de 18 jugadores tomando en cuenta lo que el considera m s conveniente hay muchos jugadores que podr an estar convocados aficionados periodistas hinchas tienen su propia selecci n pero nosotros respaldamos la lista del profesor

3512686 yo respaldo la decisi n que tom el gobierno sin ninguna duda ya que se ha nombrado como juez ad hoc a un profesional bastante destacado en el campo del derecho internacional
3512687 orrego no me merece ninguna objeci n y si el ministerio de relaciones exteriores hizo esta nominaci n todos debemos cuadrarnos con ella
3512688 ser a tremendamente negativo que se cuestionara el nombramiento una vez ya producido porque le estar amos restando calidad jur dica a un juez que representar a chile
3512689 el anuncio de las leyes habilitantes por parte del presidente ch vez se ha tratado de usar o convertir en un hecho electoral
3512690 quiero hacerle un llamado a todos los elementos que tienen parte de la opini n p blica a nivel nacional a que hagan un esfuerzo por no politizar un elemento tan importante como es la promulgaci n de las leyes hechas por el presidente ch vez
3512691 esperemos el momento para hacer las observaciones creo que si hay algunas observaciones perfectamente pueden ir al tribunal supremo de justicia que es la instancia desde el punto de vista jur dico para no contaminar esas observaciones desde el punto de vista electoral
3512692 me dicen que soy un dictador porque estamos haciendo leyes estamos haciendo leyes y las leyes deben irse adecuando a los cambios y el mundo va cambiando las leyes son para igualarnos
3512693 while wishing your father dead might be a typical childish remark in this case the little girls wish is going to come true quite quickly

3512697 the issues that will be addressed at this meeting ultimately affect our community thursday june 12 2008
3512698 weve got the termite infestation here in this unused dilapidated freezer or chiller
3512699 i have come to find that there are some peculiarities at the minimum if not non compliant documents that were submitted as part of the response to the rfp
3512700 we did ask gbb to go back to the court and ask them for mulching machines because they mayors are constantly clearing the sides of the road for safety and whatever reason and our residents dont
3512701 in this review we found that the procurement function at gpss was deficient lacking appropriate separation of duties and effective oversight to ensure compliance with procurement laws and regulation
3512702 this is one of the more prolific distributors that weve ever seen and obviously he was providing these images to lots of people
3512703 while that continues to be very sophisticated the good news is that law enforcement as well is stepping up their cooperation and technology to track these down

3512715 running a 99 seat theater is a whole different ballgame than operating a venue with four theaters
3512716 it is fairly obvious that its something worth looking at
3512717 o mei tem total apoio do governo federal todos ganham a sociedade o estado os que querem ser formais
3512718 tudo o que me foi sugerido tinha feito revisamos tudo mas o sangramento era difuso do osso do tecido mole da pele de tudo
3512719 o que me animava era que o paciente estava vivo

3512728 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses
3512729 if not russia would have continued advancing until our economy collapsed and the regime was changed
3512730 russia responded to western appeals so i think this shows that cooperation between moscow and the west is alive and well
3512731 maybe russia went a little bit further than expected in bombing georgian infrastructure but thats over with now
3512732 this is our operation and it is not affected by medvedevs words
3512733 if russia had hesitated that might have been taken as weakness of the new president
3512734 it seems like russia took a decision that may not have been completely irreproachable but it looks like there was no alternative
3512735 i came to support my nation and show we are all still strong
3512736 i supported this war in the end russia showed the world its true face
3512737 what we see is a total collapse of georgia and the responsibility is all saakashvilis
3512738 it was his personal decision to use force and the results were disastrous
3512739 for many communities impacted by homes already foreclosed on this was viewed as the linchpin to turn the tide around
3512740 this piece was important to us at a time when we have declining revenues because of the economy and increasing foreclosures
3512741 congress said to come up with the areas with the greatest need to get the money where it is needed most
3512742 we dont want speculators to come and do bottom feeding and buy up this property
3512743 it starts with eliminating condemned and distressed properties that create negative value for property owners
3512744 were looking at demolition as a way to keep people in homes
3512745 with this money we can reshape neighborhoods and plan more thoughtfully
3512746 or we may try to find a way to provide a soft second mortgage so families can keep their homes
3512747 who knows better than a mayor or a housing commissioner how the money should be spent compared to someone in washington who has no clue about conditions in your city
3512748 to get 20 million is a pretty big deal for our state
3512749 we dont have neighborhood after neighborhood of abandoned housing and we dont have a lot of subprime mortgages
3512750 we never had people walking in the streets a year ago
3512751 as an interpreter my job is talking to and interpreting what the iraqi people are saying feeling and believing about the country the coalition forces and the iraqi army
3512752 ive talked to like a million iraqis and a million american soldiers i mean who did that i dont think anyone has done that before
3512753 theres a bigger price on their heads than there is on ours
3512754 at that time i was kind of broke i didnt have a job
3512755 so the money that he paid me was good for me even though it was 80
3512756 when the americans came here they didnt know anything about this country the culture the streets and how to deal with iraqis so i believed we should stand and help them and i did
3512757 i think some of the impressions the americans had when they first came have been changed
3512758 this is why some of the mistakes that happened in the past are now getting fixed because they know more about the iraqis and they can handle the situation better than when they first came here
3512759 when you get away from the dreams and the ambitions i believe i lost my life i lost my life as an iraqi citizen
3512760 i cant walk in the streets and the markets and be normal just like anyone
3512761 many of these neighborhoods that made these great gains in the 1990s with the downturn in the beginning of this decade and the weak recovery have been hit hard by this economic change
3512762 weve lost a lot of ground and see poverty again increasing in these neighborhoods
3512763 as people try to work their way out of poverty they dont find as many of the opportunities they need in very low income neighborhoods
3512764 concentrated poverty is problematic because theres basically less opportunity for people to really improve their living standards
3512765 but the solution cant just be a matter of moving people out of poor neighborhoods we also have to think about creating opportunities within those neighborhoods
3512766 no one greets him or says hi to him low ranking employees are afraid of him i remember him walking around the campus one time and groups of people in his way would just split and let him walk through
3512767 ele disse o que tenho dito ao que me consta o vice presidente jos alencar tamb m pensa assim

3512777 how do i know that you even had a pair of glasses we are not responsible for you leaving your stuff behind the glasses are not here
3512778 youre lucky i guess you wont get a nasty claim letter from us
3512779 i guess it would be easier to say what isnt wrong with the car
3512780 the main challenge to having doctors stay here has been the workloads
3512781 thats exacerbated when were short staffed because the work all falls on the shoulders of the people that are left and then youd drive them out because theyre exhausted and then youre even shorter staffed and so the workloads increase so it becomes a vicious circle
3512782 you have to have quite general skills and youve got to have the confidence to use them without constantly having backup
3512783 so its a challenge and quite satisfying when things go well
3512784 those with the honour of knowing master cpl doyle which is almost everyone in the canadian army describe him as a warrior who was larger than life
3512785 all who served with erin wanted to be beside him especially at the most dangerous times of the mission
3512786 he could raise morale with a look a gesture or a practical joke
3512787 he passed on all the wealth of his experience to his platoon when he spoke they listened and he never had to repeat himself twice when correcting a soldier
3512788 im personally inspired every day by all the soldiers across the battle group but there are a few across the battle group who inspire me a little more when i come across them and doyle was one of those guys
3512789 he always had some ideas about how we could improve things he always thought twice about what we were doing and how we could make it better
3512790 chipotle is hopping on the locavore bandwagon by promising to buy from small to mid size local farms a significant amount of the produce used at its 730 plus locations the starting commitment is to source 25 percent of one particular item per season from the locals
3512791 rose waters third annual fool pig roast is thursday august 21 at 7pm only a few tix remain the name fool pig roast stems from a visit from the health department three weeks after their first endeavor at cooking outside one of their park slope neighbors had called and complained that cooking a full animal outside on the sidewalk was smoky disgusting and inappropriate the inspector couldnt find any evidence noting that there was no fool pig anywhere to be seen

3512796 were going to have to move after were done filming
3512797 you can hear the tour guides like just yesterday we saw lauren conrad pulling into her driveway and she stopped to get the mail
3512798 l a is a really young city and its great for now but eventually im going to want to settle down a little bit
3512799 hes got this really cool style and im always bugging him that we should do a guys line together
3512800 it would be more his thing but i would help him with it
3512801 i believe in a private ballot i dont want to ever influence someones vote or have my vote change someones opinion of me
3512802 it hurts its something no one should have to go through
3512803 anger is not an emotion i will allow myself to indulge in
3512804 the downturn in real estate values has severely affected the companys ability to pay investors
3512805 this is incredibly stressful for mr rangel his concern is for the investors in his various companies
3512806 it doesnt matter where you are in the points until after richmond
3512807 were heading into a stretch of tracks that i really enjoy racing at so hopefully well be able to make up some ground there
3512808 im racing for wins right now and committed to not making mistakes
3512809 so im going to do both im going to execute on the race track and not make mistakes but weve got to win some races to get some points when the chase starts
3512810 we ran pretty good and had a pretty good car i want to make the car better i like that race track it is a lot of fun to race on these cars are pretty challenging this year but that is still a fun track for me
3512811 being only 128 behind bowyer is not the end of the world
3512812 we need to race to win and if we can win some races we can close that gap really quickly
3512813 chacun est engag jai eu laccord de tous les protagonistes
3512814 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3512815 i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and trans atlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship
3512816 would not be in the best interest of the community
3512817 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3512818 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
3512819 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
3512820 our complaint alleges an affinity fraud of very large scale
3512821 in this case one of the defendants used his extensive connections in the orthodox jewish community to solicit more than 250 million from unsuspecting investors
3512822 when we call to mind the image of a mark who has just been separated from his money we sometimes attempt to account for the greatness of his anger by the greatness of his financial loss
3512823 its effectively the government holding a gun to the heads of the courts and saying cut firefighters wages or youll be responsible for people burning in their homes
3512824 its our intention that when parliament resumes if were in government that the legislation implementing those recommendations for reform of the cannabis laws would be introduced into the parliament as a matter of priority
3512825 we see rhodes as an athletic tenacious 4 5 type that can shoot the mid range shot and is a very good rebounder
3512826 smith is a guy we have our eye on the rest are open for discussion
3512827 i think sir alex realises we werent too far away from united when they were at the very top of their game
3512828 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players in their team who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years
3512829 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again
3512830 wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic with the injuries weve had as players we can all raise the bar a little bit
3512831 with it being that close in the premier league and champions league they know well give them a big run for their money
3512832 i think we can close the gap because man utd were at the very top of their game last season
3512833 im taking nothing away from them because theyve been unbelievable over the past two years
3512834 but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3512835 it doesnt get any easier seeing them lift the trophy that we made ours when jose mourinho first took over
3512836 we want it back and thats what we aiming for we have to move on from last year
3512837 we were the nearly team last year almost won the carling cup almost won the champions league almost won the premier league
3512838 we were very close but at the end of the day we werent good enough and we need to raise the bar
3512839 we must set ourselves big targets to win the premier league to win the fa cup to get back to the final of the champions league and win it
3512840 thats the target for the whole chelsea team and fans
3512841 franks not going anywhere and didier is the same over the summer its been they could move here they could move there
3512842 i think they know they are now at chelsea and weve got to make it happen this year
3512843 hopefully thinks can get resolved with frank and didier i certainly hope the contracts can get sorted out
3512844 this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well they play very good football and had a fantastic season
3512845 so i am very happy to come here with the opportunity to play in the premier league we are also playing in europe this season so that will be good
3512846 i watched villa last season and martin oneill is a very good coach he plays exciting attacking football and i am excited to be here
3512847 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility every player wants to play international football and that is my aim
3512848 well still have some players coming in to give us a chance and if were lucky enough to qualify for the group stages of the uefa cup that would take us right up to christmas and well most definitely need the squad
3512849 last season we were exceptionally lucky with injuries eight or nine players played over 30 games and we didnt have big runs in the fa or league cup therefore we were able to concentrate on the league
3512850 all that could change this season and the fact is that we need the squad to be bigger to cope with that thats what were trying to do
3512851 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed carlos cuellar has been a great player for the football club and inevitably there has been speculation about him playing in the premiership
3512852 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3512853 she was a very intelligent dog to live for that long
3512854 she scratched my chest she was jumping on me and excited to get out of there she got in the truck and was licking on me
3512855 he went running towards her trying to get some bones trying to feed her treats
3512856 they would go to a park down from the house and they would play fetch forever and ever and ever
3512857 recent weaknesses in terms of equity underwriting equities trading and private equities are hitting goldman at its core strength
3512858 in short goldman is no longer as much in the right place at the right time
3512859 customer volumes overall weak global equity markets and weak advisory and underwriting revenues
3512860 the street estimates for goldman sachs are much too high and must be reduced significantly
3512861 at the moment the light at the end of this tunnel is very dim
3512862 we made significant progress in our solar division during the quarter
3512863 substantially increasing the number of crystalline silicon systems shipped and enabling start up production on the first four sunfab thin film lines at customer sites
3512864 maybe they have a lack of confidence now but as soon as they have a good match they will fight for the title
3512865 we worked very hard but results were not the ones we expected
3512866 when the past tournament ended it was quite good and we finished third we were quite optimistic ahead of the clausura
3512867 i am not thinking about signing players at the moment because they cannot play against liege tomorrow i am only concentrating on this game
3512868 and i have not needed to contact the owners because they cannot help with the preparation for this match i prefer not to say anything else
3512869 i was really calm last week and i am concentrating on the game we did not have big problems
3512870 i have not been distracted i have been focusing on this game and getting to the champions league group stages
3512871 i always have confidence in my players but when you play against anyone in europe you have to be very careful
3512872 we know standard are a good team especially at home
3512873 it is not just english clubs that should worry about making mistakes against smaller teams every club must be aware of the quality of your opponents
3512874 you must be really focused for every game you cannot change things once you have made a mistake
3512875 my aim is to win here to make sure we progress since i have been at liverpool we have always known how important it is to qualify for the group stages
3512876 we always have known and we must make sure that we do qualify for the next stage
3512877 there is no more pressure than in previous seasons we all know how important it is to get past this qualifying round
3512878 everyone knows how important the champions league is for us we must play well
3512879 i am not thinking about signing players at the moment because they cannot play against liege tomorrow i am only concentrating on this game
3512880 will get better and better and could easily be as good as any partnership in the competition
3512881 i am here and intend to see the job through we have great expectations and i hope that i am able to fulfill them
3512882 david moyes did a fantastic job at everton on very limited resources last season and as a new manager he is the sort of person i look up to
3512883 he is not getting the credit he deserves but he is competing with the big four without having the same money
3512884 i must admit i was stunned by the draw it is very very tough
3512885 it could hardly be more difficult for us and to get a draw like this after waiting so long to play in the champions league just left me speechless well almost
3512886 we respect liverpool greatly it will take a lot for us to beat them they are a great side with great players and we have a very slim chance
3512887 will be integral to ensuring that our party creates a forward looking platform that is rooted in our core values and principles
3512888 economic policy including technology and innovation taxes trade economic development labor and related issues
3512889 a total of 56 200 manufacturing jobs were lost between january 1997 and november 2007 almost 25 0 percent of total manufacturing employment it now appears that the rate of job losses in this sector has moderated although further consolidation in the nondurables sector is likely

3512893 representatives of the special olympics the national down syndrome congress and the american association of people with disabilities are among those that said they would picket the movie beginning with a screening monday in los angeles

3512895 jump in the water and start moving your arms and legs

3512897 what makes you know that you have to make use of this strategy is it something you hear see or feel maybe even taste or smell
3512898 what must happen in order for you to execute the strategy
3512899 i need to feel extremely nervous and get my hands cold that is when i begin to jump around to psyche myself up for the audience by the time i am done jumping i see the audience in my mind enthralled
3512900 nervous means i am breathing heavier and my heart is pumping harder than normal

3512902 well if you were perfectly calm it means that you have met the audience before or you know your topic inside out and have been doing the same thing over and over again

3512915 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3512916 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3512917 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3512918 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3512919 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3512937 as an interpreter my job is talking to and interpreting what the iraqi people are saying feeling and believing about the country the coalition forces and the iraqi army
3512938 ive talked to like a million iraqis and a million american soldiers i mean who did that i dont think anyone has done that before
3512939 theres a bigger price on their heads than there is on ours
3512940 at that time i was kind of broke i didnt have a job
3512941 so the money that he paid me was good for me even though it was 80
3512942 when the americans came here they didnt know anything about this country the culture the streets and how to deal with iraqis so i believed we should stand and help them and i did
3512943 i think some of the impressions the americans had when they first came have been changed
3512944 this is why some of the mistakes that happened in the past are now getting fixed because they know more about the iraqis and they can handle the situation better than when they first came here
3512945 when you get away from the dreams and the ambitions i believe i lost my life i lost my life as an iraqi citizen

3513018 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3513019 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3513020 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3513021 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3513022 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3513023 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3513024 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3513025 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3513026 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3513027 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3513028 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3513029 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3513030 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3513031 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3513032 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3513033 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3513034 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3513035 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3513036 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3513037 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3513038 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3513039 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3513040 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3513041 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3513042 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3513043 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3513044 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3513045 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3513046 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3513047 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3513048 who are open to doing something on the production side
3513049 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3513050 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3513051 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3513052 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3513053 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3513054 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3513055 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3513056 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3513057 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3513058 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3513059 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3513060 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3513061 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3513062 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3513063 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3513064 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3513065 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3513066 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3513067 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3513068 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3513069 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3513070 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3513071 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3513072 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3513073 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3513074 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3513075 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3513076 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3513077 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3513078 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3513079 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3513080 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3513081 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3513082 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3513083 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3513084 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3513085 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3513086 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3513087 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3513088 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3513103 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
3513104 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
3513105 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
3513106 that would allow the me japanese etc to wear period stuff at pennsic which should be the periodest of events not the least period of all
3513107 you know youve really outgrown that garb and now you just look fat and ridiculous if you want to get some better fitting garb come over to my booth and i can make something up for you
3513108 keep in mind many of the participants in pennsic are not scadians and are members of other organizations that have their own dress codes they are there as our guests and just as we as scadians extend our courtesies to their titles we also must be respectful of their customs and modes of dress
3513109 maybe its just me but i find most of my garb to be far more comfortable than my mundanes
3513110 basically what im hearing so far is us womenfolk can wear what we want as long were showing some titty
3513111 historys great untold stories larger than life characters amp dramatic events that changed the world
3513112 oh and ill fitting loincloths have caused some offense some things are things one just really doesnt want to look up and see
3513113 if the tunic was long enough i dont really see a problem
3513114 if the tunic was long enough i dont really see a problem
3513115 but anyways what was my point i dont know i just pictured that whole scene in my head again and went into a shocked daze
3513116 wow ziggy hey i didnt realize bret michaels lead singer of poison was at pennsic this year
3513117 when i said that i love ribs i meant that i love ribs forever
3513118 where as a band like jethro tull gained their following through entire album after album of well thought out music and constant touring many 80s bands gained instant fame through one catchy song or a clever video
3513119 if its any comfort the beatles were the most popular band at my highschool in the late 90s
3513120 if it was not someone like g b h alien sex fiend janes addiction ministry or something along those lines then i did not pay it much attention
3513121 i am assuming this guy with the tattoos would be hard to look at even if there werent tattoos is it the loincloth or the ink
3513122 and while tats cant be removed for war one can wear garb to cover em up
3513123 what is that old adage when in rome do as the romans do
3513124 i think i need to get that for some of my students i have one class that every so often starts resembling adhd on speed
3513125 naw ziggy thats be adhd on red bull or your choice of energy drink they sell ti legally to them at every corner store and some schools even doh
3513126 i know the 80s were a long time ago but your autographed poison tour t shirt doesnt count as garb i dont care how old it is
3513127 i know the 80s were a long time ago but your autographed poison tour t shirt doesnt count as garb
3513128 but if its in that nebulus time between 1601 and 1650 then it is up for debate
3513129 i had a dream about jefffrey last night got that off my chest gonna go now
3513130 there is faiurly good documentation in brazil and also in portugal that there was regular contact between the native americans of brazil and portugal going back to the early 14th century 1300s
3513131 well yes there is documentation but youre not going to like it
3513132 i say we make a movement for more 14th centrury brazilian womens garb next year at pennsic gt
3513133 im wearin my crown royal bag and nothin else to pennsic next year
3513134 but i have been coming to the conclusion that the people who maintain hte
3513135 as gulf wars is a family event merchandise inappropriate to a family situation should not be displayed this is medieval reenactment not fantasy science fiction or post 1600 ce time period remember this in your merchandise modern clothing with sca theme artwork should be displayed folded not hanging
3513136 so can i sell my corsets so long as the customer agrees never to never let it be seen by those who would take offense
3513137 theyre allowed to sell it whatever it is here so it must be ok to wear here
3513138 well if they can wear that so can i right
3513139 we dont care about all that mid evil stuff were just here to par tay
3513140 i see that you do put a lot of time and effort in your products and your display however i tend to agree with mistress seraphina on the appearance of the majority of the items in your current lineup while im sure many of your products are popular that doesnt make them appropriate for our merchant area many years ago you couldnt look around at any event without seeing elf ears and bikinis of bunny fur or chainmail for good or ill those days are mostly gone while your lineup doesnt stray nearly that far from period and or reality they are not quite what we want to see in our merchants area if you change your lineup we would be happy to see you at gulf wars
3513141 we wanted something that the mom or dad whos bringing home for the family could say this is what i remember and this is what i want to play with my kids
3513142 at the same time we wanted something the kids would feel like it belonged to them and this is something thats very appealing to them so we tried to blend those two worlds it plays like clue it feels like clue but it just feels like clue that would have been created in the 21st century
3513143 awesome yeah im definitely going then id completely forgotten about it and then i figured it might be too late but thats perfect
3513144 i dont really care about japanese animation but you go to a nerdy art school im sure tons of people would be interested
3513145 just be warned that if im all over you its because of your character v and youre so taking my new ripstik for your hoverboard
3513146 looks up what a ripstik is holy shit thats insane theres only 2 wheels
3513147 urgh this is all your fault my money and id are back at the hotel were starving my feet hurt and were lost
3513148 im so glad i ran into you here i got the rest for you
3513149 al calar della notte i gaucho continuano a raccontare le loro bugie accanto al fuoco alzo la testa per guardare il cielo pieno di stelle di migliaia di stelle
3513150 this is how sieg heil got started and no im not saying obama is hitler i just think people should be careful about slipping into a personality cult for a charismatic leader
3513151 if i aint got you was okay but not really amazing
3513152 we really want a picture of me him you and carly
3513153 i know you said the guys always get the gifts and the girls never do and thats not fair so we made this for you
3513154 oh a chipmunk how cute its scratching its back on the pavement or something
3513155 what are you doing rabbit your kin is hurt go help her stop stuffing your face and go save her bring her to your lair and nurse her back to health you selfish coldhearted bitch what the hell are you doing how can you be munching away with not a care in the world at a time like this
3513156 should i call the vet the animal rescue police should i try to help the bunny myself
3513157 maybe i can save it should i feed it some milk isnt that what they do with sick baby animals how is there a dropper in the house where probably not why would they have a dropper and do they have any milk
3513158 if the bunny rests for a while its wound will heal maybe if it lies there it will get better maybe its not so bad maybe it just needs to rest and then it will regain the strength to walk away maybe when i leave here to go back to the city the mother rabbit will emerge and take the baby away and nurse it back to health
3513159 nope theres no rabbit lying anywhere around here all i see is grass
3513160 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3513161 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3513162 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3513163 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3513164 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3513165 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3513166 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3513167 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3513168 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3513169 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3513170 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3513171 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3513172 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3513173 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3513420 there are a lot of conflicts in the north which are tied to ethnic considerations so if nana akufo addo is not careful he could undermine the electoral fortunes of the npp by nominating the wrong person

3513437 mao says the following socialist society covers a very long historical period classes and class struggle continue to exist in this society and the struggle still goes on between the road of socialism and the road of capitalism the socialist revolution on the economic front in the ownership of the means of production is insufficient by itself and cannot be consolidated there must also be a thorough socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts i would encourage people to closely study this important article what mao is describing is of course still happening in china and it is becoming accute in my opinion we need to look at revisionism and capitalist resortation dialectically part of dialectical materialism is an understanding that change occurs as a process including quantitative accumulation followed by a qualitative leap dialectical and historical materialism
3513438 this transition period has to be a period of struggle between dying capitalism and nascent communism or in other words between capitalism which has been defeated but not destroyed and communism which has been born but is still very feeble

3513442 die russen wollten bereits seit langem ihre s dlichen grenzen sichern
3513443 und ich denke wir haben den rger moskaus ber das wachsende engagement der nato in russlands hinterhof untersch tzt
3513444 russland will einen regimewechsel aber bisher nicht mit milit rischen mitteln
3513445 sie haben nur milit rische ziele angegriffen was zeigt dass sie die regierung nicht milit risch st rzen wollen aber sicher f nden sie es besser wenn saakaschwili ersetzt w rde
3513446 russland wollte eine lektion erteilen und zwar nicht nur den georgiern
3513447 international m sste moskau dann mit einer weitreichenden verschlechterung der beziehungen rechnen deswegen haben sie sich darauf beschr nkt saakaschwili vor der ganzen welt zu dem tigen
3513448 russland hat dieses spiel gewonnen auch deshalb weil sie den krieg so kurz halten konnten

3513473 they were close in time they were only eight days apart they occurred at approximately the same time of day they occurred in the same vicinity and there are similarities in the suspects descriptions
3513474 its clear that mr rodriguez was angry and because of that he started making up allegations
3513475 i would suggest that he has a deep seated hatred for ms nealley a jealousy
3513476 mr rodriguez who had been stealing great sums of money and living extravagantly got himself in trouble
3513477 as the facts come out well go forward from there

3513479 nicolas chacon preyed on unsuspecting women in the neighborhoods of somerville and medford putting those entire communities in fear
3513480 the victims bravely came forward to explain what happened to them and because of their courage this dangerous predator has been taken off the streets for a significant period of time i want to thank the somerville medford and tufts police departments for their excellent investigative work in this case
3513481 we all found out about it through the das press release there was very little advance notice
3513482 the whole community all the way up was saddened and shocked by leones announcement
3513483 were close in time they were only eight days apart they occurred at approximately the same time of day they occurred in the same vicinity and there are similarities in the suspects descriptions
3513484 detectives are working on that and we expect them to be charging somebody soon
3513485 i cant say who it is because they have not appeared in court yet for that charge
3513486 because of the lack of criminal record and based on the facts of the case we asked what was appropriate and the judge agreed
3513487 when youre dealing with victims in this sort of incident they can be very emotional
3513488 before we put out information we want to make sure we have all the facts straight victims are not always available to talk when we want to talk to them
3513489 id say that its unnerving that the public wouldnt be notified but who knows what kind of protocol they have to go through or maybe theres a reason that they had to wait
3513490 but it does seem like four days is a bit much to let that go on for
3513491 its a little bit safer now that one persons been put away but its not just the problem of one person
3513492 there is no written and signed contract between the parties for sale of the land involved in this case as in gibbens v hardin 239 va 425 430 389 s e 2d 478 480 1990 here there is a lack of clear and convincing evidence that the moormans and blackstock ever mutually agreed to all the essential terms of the contract for the sale additionally where parties intend to culminate their agreement with a signed contract there is a strong presumption that no contract exists until a contract is formally signed and in writing
3513493 once this plays out i think youll see that theres a reason how this could have happened
3513494 i think we were lucky to have someone join us with as much experience and qualification for the job as joe

3513561 the longer it takes the more people will begin to suspect that people are trying to back away
3513562 while this investigation is taking so long people are losing the trust that they had in the county government and it is a very big heavy cloud not only on the correctional officers but on the county
3513563 the longer it takes people will begin to suspect that the county government is trying to do a cover up and that is not what we want to happen

3513574 the science of selecting trees for different uses around the world has not been well studied
3513575 she holds fast to the notion that if you are in the aura of a black walnut tree theres a healing effect
3513576 it needs more science to be able to say that
3513577 in a walk through old growth forest there are thousands if not millions of chemicals and their synergistic effects with one another

3513590 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
3513591 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
3513592 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
3513593 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
3513594 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
3513595 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
3513596 like just everywhere arms legs neck chest guts wherever he could swing it he got it
3513597 it looked kind of like a scuffle or an argument you know and then somebodys like knife knife run so i was running up the alleyway slapping people telling them to get going move get off the bus i got pushed over some lady got pushed over i was just making sure everybody was ok and we all got off the bus
3513598 the attacker was over top of the victim continually cutting him i think the victim was gone at that point
3513599 when we came back on the bus it was visible at the end of the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
3513600 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
3513601 they did an awesome thing holding him in there because if not what would have happened

3513620 let us discuss it with the other participants but i think i can say that its hard to imagine this would be fruitful at this time
3513621 oh how cool you can even see the cream holes
3513622 i preside over the greatest collection of integrity and idealism
3513623 people voted for change and they voted for democrats who will take our country in a new direction
3513624 the public doesnt want to know about process and 60 votes they want outcomes they want results
3513625 whether its the deficit or the challenges to the constitution we have to dig our way out
3513626 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today
3513627 who gave you the right to take the constitution and shove it down the toilet who gave you the right to take impeachment off the table nobody told them to do this
3513628 one million iraqis are dead five thousand americans are dead you have destroyed the first second fourth fifth and eighth amendments

3513634 he took the view that a finders fee was the usual and standard practice
3513635 i loved those paintings for all those years and they were gone
3513636 people have realized that the complete removal of the feminine element from the christian message is a shortcoming from an anthropological viewpoint it is theologically and anthropologically important for woman to be at the center of christianity
3513637 that there may be an increase in the number of those who as volunteers offer their services to the christian community with generous and prompt availability
3513638 the sentiments recently expressed by the archbishop of canterbury and the lord chief justice concerning sharia law are very telling in the rush to be tolerant or sensitive to religious difference they create the space for the most reactionary and even fundamentalist religious leaders to take control of minority communities and they enable a climate which allows religion to define our roles in both private and public spaces
3513639 their sentiments appear contingent on the false assumption that black and minority cultures are intrinsically opposed to universal human rights principles and that they do not contribute to the body of law based on such principles that now inform the english legal system in doing so they allow religious and cultural contexts to become the overriding framework within which those from ethnic and religious minorities are perceived inevitably drawing on very narrow assumptions about religion and the role of women

3513647 you have to keep working you have to keep going we have the freedom to do anything we want to do and if youre doing boring crappy work rethink it
3513648 i like the idea of painting being in a complex multidisciplinary world where it can be tested

3513687 pl tzlich standen drei m nner hinter uns die sagten sie w ren vom zoll aus dresden und es l ge eine anzeige wegen schwarzarbeit vor ich wusste gar nicht wie mir geschieht war mir ja keiner schuld bewusst
3513688 ich musste meinen ausweis holen und ein protokoll ausf llen am ende sagten mir die beamten es w re alles okay die haben sich sogar noch entschuldigt nat rlich durften sie mir nicht erz hlen wer mich angezeigt hatte fragten aber ob ich spezielle freunde im rathaus h tte

3513691 in short there could be much more oil under the sea than previously known the demand for energy is going up not down and for a long time even as alternative sources of energy are developed more oil will be needed
3513692 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth with oil prices still above 100 a barrel that charge never made sense
3513693 with the roaring economies of china and india gobbling up oil in the two countries latter day industrial revolutions the united states can no longer afford to turn its back on finding all the sources of fuel necessary to maintain its economy and its standard of living whats required is a long term comprehensive plan that includes wind solar geothermal biofuels and nuclear and that acknowledges that oil and gas will be instrumental to the u s economy for many years to come
3513694 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and america s coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today
3513695 with just three percent of the worlds oil reserves our nation simply doesnt have enough oil to impact the global market or drill our way to lower prices at the pump
3513696 we listened to the air traffic tapes and there was no indication from the pilot that he was experiencing any problems
3513697 it sounded like he tried to turn he went northeast turned back and then the plane went into a nosedive
3513698 all we heard was a boom and we saw the parking lot across the street had smoke in it
3513699 someone said it was a plane and people were running out of the way like they must have heard it coming
3513700 i didnt think anything of it it looked pretty close to the mansfield airport and i thought he was just awaiting to land
3513701 he didnt have any landing gear down or anything the plane wasnt sputtering i went into hannafords and then i heard the explosion it just shook everything
3513702 this is the kind of assistance we are receiving now

3513706 both our organs of perception and the phenomenal world we perceive seem to be best understood as systems of pure pattern or as geometric structures of form and proportion therefore when many ancient cultures chose to examine reality through the metaphors of geometry and music they were already very close to the position of our most contemporary science
3513707 it was kind of a typical tuesday morning practice for us in pads
3513708 it was a little sharper and i thought there was a little more energy than we had last tuesday
3513709 were adjusting to the schedule overall it was a good day and we got some work done
3513710 i talked to them monday when we came back in about our practice maybe not being as sharp and crisp last week as we needed it
3513711 i think there was a little more focus today but it was good good work
3513712 were getting closer to breaking camp and thats always a good thing for all of us these games are important and this month is important to get ready but when the real games start coming is when the excitement really starts
3513713 veteran wide receiver courtney roby is a real aggressive player he has been an excellent special teams player for us not only returning the ball but on the coverage units he has been a very good blocker he catches the ball well and obviously from being in tennessees camp he knows the professional game so its not like having a rookie he has been good he has been a good addition to our receiving corps
3513714 this last game just past i couldnt make the trip its too hard to be on that sideline not playing so i stayed home and watched the game on television if god keeps me healthy ill be out there this week and get a chance to make some plays
3513715 we shifted him over to the strong side and he has made a very
3513716 i think for any young guy its tough in training camp not being there i remember that situation myself as a player in the late 1970s then you take an aggressive guy like that a guy who really loves to play and loves to hit he misses his contact time
3513717 but hes done a good job of staying in the rehab schedule and staying with our trainers i think he probably got back a little faster than maybe we would have thought
3513718 i have a good feel for what the coaches expect out of me
3513719 theres still a lot of game shape i want to get into
3513720 a lot of these guys on our team have a couple of games ahead of me theyre probably going to be in better shape than i am me and a couple of other guys stayed after practice to get some extra running in you dont ever want to give up to your opponent because you werent in shape
3513721 right now im still learning and learning and learning if things go well ill get a blessing ill play great and be a factor on our defense
3513722 it shouldnt be a problem we have great coaches who coach you where youre supposed to be in any situation you should be able to just jump in there to play good football
3513723 everybody always wants to complain about camp and even i complain about camp the thing is if you arent out there youre missing a lot
3513724 we looked at it and wanted to hold off as long as we could
3513725 realistically hes going to be two months into the season going with two guys didnt seem feasible we had some injuries at some other spots we needed to shore up
3513726 its tough for mike because he did a great job rehabbing his shoulder he was doing well and it was kind of a freak injury that ruined his year hell bounce back
3513727 they could get some at the end of the week
3513728 my sense is well probably hold them until the start of next week theyre lobbying hard for it
3513729 hes doing fine on course hes moving better and doing a lot of rehab work im not sure exactly when hell start practicing but hes doing fine
3513730 i thought the portfolio presentation was a bit much for a room over oreillys holy grail
3513731 he was trying too hard to impress me but i wasnt sure why i thought maybe it was because im female
3513732 you can go into a store and steal a loaf of bread and do a year in jail
3513733 but you can steal months of rent from a landlord and never do any time in jail its a great crime to commit because there are no penalties
3513734 at first i thought he was an attorney i had worked with
3513735 it took me a while to remember who he was but thats how he comes across a smooth talking gentleman in a nice blue blazer and khakis like a harvard man

3513909 isi is behind it according to whatever information we have we would expect that the political leadership of pakistan would take some action against it either against rogue elements in it or an isi operating without control
3513910 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
3513911 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan

3513965 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3513966 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3513967 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3513968 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3513969 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3513970 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3513971 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3513973 with employers under ever increasing economic pressure to identify high cost chronically ill and low productivity employees the temptation to violate these principles is significant
3513974 this temptation is amplified by employers financial sponsorship of and frequent operational involvement in the implementation of phrs and phr data gathering infrastructures for their employees
3513975 employers should establish oversight and accountability mechanisms for adhering to their phr policies and practices
3513976 the use of an independent public watchdog process would do much to address this widespread lack of trust well in advance of any government regulation
3513977 without meaningful oversight sugar coated public relations statements about corporate sponsored phrs and mere promises of good corporate behavior will not be sufficient for employees to trust their employers with their sensitive personal health information
3513978 of course it caused some fears in them but things have come back to normal
3513979 if we continue without support we re going to have more casualties
3513980 i m not worried about the bombs anymore i m used to them
3513981 i know that there will be people beating themselves up over what happened but now is the time for us to come together as a family and comfort them
3513982 the bottom line is that everyone involved did one hell of a job
3513983 the worst thing we can do is be in a hurry
3513984 it s better to do it right than fast where more could get injured
3513985 it s a complicated situation but we ve determined that saving houses did not outweigh the casualty risk
3513986 i m pissed off that i ve been out here for 13 hours and haven t got to search
3513987 but at the same time if it s that bad it s better to do what they re doing
3513988 i always hear soldiers dogging the air force but they sure are quick to call in close air support from air force jets
3513989 the bush administrations move to outsource large portions of the iraq war effort sets a dangerous precedent
3513990 the increasing use of private contractors restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3513991 in general the u s government has placed greater emphasis in recent decades on outsourcing activities to the private sector that are not inherently governmental
3513992 the governments policy is to subject services identified as commercial to the forces of competition in addition the ratio of contractor personnel to military personnel reflects the united states attempt to reconstruct iraq while military activities are under way rather than delaying rebuilding until hostilities have ended
3513993 the record number of private contractors in iraq raises a host of serious concerns
3513994 there are billions of taxpayer dollars being funneled to both american and foreign companies often through no bid contracts ongoing pentagon audits have revealed that vast sums of this money have been misspent or improperly recorded
3513995 that analysis indicates that the costs of the private contractor did not differ greatly from the costs of having a comparable military unit performing similar functions
3513996 during peacetime however the military unit would remain in the force structure and continue to accrue costs at a peacetime rate whereas the private security contract would not have to be renewed
3513997 this is a welcome report in that gets the facts out there
3513998 and it unmistakably debunked a number of these great myths about iraq that many people want to believe

3514006 i think it speaks to the economic climate that these teams are dealing with
3514007 what mightve made sense at 8 to 12 million becomes a difficult equation at 16 to 20 million because you arent necessarily selling more product just because the racing has gotten more expensive

3514009 i admit im not totally ready to give up my keyboard for some applications like the content management systems on our website voice commands dont work well another issue for some users will be the price the professional version im testing sells for over 800 however the standard version sells for only 99 and offers much the same functionality
3514010 this project is linked to the decision that al sayyid muqtada al sadr issued over a month ago when he divided the al mahdi army into two parts the first includes thousands and millions of al mahdi army elements who have been banned from carrying arms and who have been ordered to engage in religious cultural and social programs and the second includes those who will be chosen by leader muqtada al sadr to form jihad brigades and fight against the occupation forces
3514011 such brigades are yet to be formed and we are waiting for the outcome of the negotiations over an agreement between iraq and the united states
3514012 the al mumahhidun project will deal with the first part of the al mahdi army that is those who will engage in religious seminary related and cultural awareness programs
3514013 the al mahdi army will be transformed into a non political cultural and social organization
3514014 this supervision will allow the sadrist trend to nominate lecturers and figures who will contribute to the implementation of the al mumahhidun project on the religious level as for the cultural level there is a cultural commission that is in charge of determining curricula and nonreligious cultural programs provided for those participating in this project
3514015 al sayyid kazim al hairi the al sadr trend religious authority will supervise the kind of curricula that will be offered
3514016 compare search volume patterns across specific regions categories and time frames

3514020 that is one technology that i just do not understand i dont see the appeal i dont like
3514021 not saying this isnt a good story and maybe even good news but a reliance on unattributed and or
3514022 the premeditated slaying of john lennon with an essentially clear mind
3514023 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3514024 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant offense and undermine respect for the law
3514025 he trabajado bastante con la bici de contrarreloj y hemos modificado algunos ngulos aunque la posici n ya estaba bastante lograda creo que no tengo el ritmo de los que vienen del tour como cancellara schumacher o el australiano cadel evans pero creo que puedo estar a un gran nivel

3514031 youve always said theres more than one way to skin a cat coach gibbs has his own way and coach zorn has his own way
3514032 coach zorn definitely has a very positive attitude i think that trickles down to the team
3514033 and put two or three guys on andre and jason

3514035 the banks lent in excess of 100 million its just mind boggling to me
3514036 diverted to pay kickbacks and referral fees to individuals and entities that referred new investors
3514037 my biggest setback was my suspension but it taught me a lesson
3514038 so i made it a point when i did get suspended to do everything i could to get back on
3514039 i had it decided in my mind that i was going to come back harder than ever and i was going to bust my tail to get everything done to prove myself
3514040 because its a little bit easier to know what the defense might be in or makes the coverage easier to read
3514041 it was fantastic to do that album not only live with that music that i love everyday but i just worked with such wonderful musicians who are so talented i would love to do another album right now though id like to focus on developing something to direct

3514045 this will make them more nimble than having to travel with a full load of traditional news gear

3514050 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3514051 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3514052 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3514053 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3514054 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3514055 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3514056 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3514057 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3514058 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3514059 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3514060 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3514061 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3514062 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3514063 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3514064 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3514065 that does not mean as some people have suggested that those officials who were found by the joint reports to have committed misconduct have suffered no consequences
3514066 far from it the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3514067 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see
3514068 as a general matter in such cases where disciplinary referrals are appropriate they are made to put it in concrete terms i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3514069 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3514070 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
3514071 im committed to finding ways to improve compliance and reduce taxpayer burden so that we begin to bridge the tax gap which accounts for 345 billion in legally owed but uncollected federal revenues each year
3514072 shows yet again the need for full fledged tax reform next year
3514073 im still trying to find someone but i dont think it will get any better in the foreseeable future
3514074 the process is very time consuming and i am already very busy as it is
3514075 this is the unfortunate reality of our health care system its an example of how the market triumphs over public policy
3514076 even if universal health care comes into play tomorrow not everyone would have access to a health care provider
3514077 for the future we need to retain at least 50 percent of residents trained inside of maryland and also make it more attractive for those who want to come from outside the state
3514078 i dont want to be strapped down with loans forever and i know that primary care pays on the lower end of the spectrum
3514079 the largest insurance companies in the state have not raised their reimbursement rates
3514080 ongoing expenses such as vaccines cost me more than what the insurance companies pay me
3514081 i love what i do and i get to take care of people on an extended basis
3514082 i develop a relationship with patients some through three four generations
3514083 i knew that dr bennett was going to have trouble finding another partner
3514084 i know at least three four family practices that cant find anyone and theyve been looking longer than him
3514085 theyve crunched the numbers and concluded they cant head to the lake after a 20 percent loss in their net worth
3514086 many of my neighbors have also come out of retirement
3514087 besides the satisfaction we get from our jobs were all trying to make sure our nest eggs last as long as we do
3514088 this is just the beginning of a long term trend the changing nature of retirement income will make boomers more and more vulnerable to market downturns
3514089 i talked to my financial planner who thought i could afford to do those things even though im only 60
3514090 im debt free i dont even have a mortgage and ive been able to save for my retirement
3514091 im not hurting but im wondering whether the economy will deteriorate further
3514092 we look at what would happen to their nest egg if the market collapsed the day after they retired
3514093 then we see whether theyd have enough time to recover and enough money to live on throughout retirement
3514094 anyone who withdraws too much in a bear market especially early in retirement will outlive his money
3514095 a good rule is to take out no more than 4 percent a year that should keep a portfolio going for many years
3514096 if the market were better i wouldnt work at all
3514097 but my cardiologist tells me i may live to be 95 and my mutual funds certainly arent giving me the kind of returns ill need to last that long
3514098 because i dont see myself sitting at home and eating cat food i will keep chasing consulting jobs
3514099 even those who dont plan to move after retirement are still psychologically affected by falling home values
3514100 they look at their net worth on paper and feel poorer so they continue working
3514101 senator hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3514102 geographic reach has become a more important thing for us
3514103 president bush and karl rove are attempting to block voter registration of at least 200 000 and possibly as much as 400 000 veterans
3514104 we may have the clock running out on us but we will not give up this needs to be shoved in the face of every single elected official in the country we can fix this in a second we are talking about two or three sentences in legislation we are talking about the integrity of our democracy
3514105 but it is almost physically impossible to get it passed and implemented in time
3514106 and that is a funding bill if we can get any of this legislation tacked onto a funding bill the president has to sign it
3514107 if the other secretaries of state are not as active as we are the va will not do anything for them
3514108 while the hope for 2009 is a real one the practical effect now is that the first voters who have been suppressed by the gop in 2008 are the wounded warriors living in the governments own facilities
3514109 theyre trying hard to win theres only so much you can do theyre not supermen
3514110 i think its very simple weve been devastated by injuries no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team

3514112 its not making excuses its reality thats part of the game thats clearly our problem
3514113 his first objective is to take responsibility of the operational management of the company and implement immediately a restructuring plan that will increase the companys profitability and ensure the long term success
3514114 given our current situation we believe these are the right steps to take at this time to enable the company to grow profitably in the long term
3514115 a more thorough operational review of its business activities to reposition its competitiveness

3514136 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3514137 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3514138 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3514139 require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force

3514147 the reported figures are very positive operating income was 18 0 better than our expectations and net income was 10 0 better than our forecast
3514148 we would recommend buying into renewable energy now its stocks have been overvalued for a long time and until this spring our recommendation was to sell

3514152 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3514153 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3514154 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation

3514166 some people seem to forget those planes flying into the wtc
3514167 it fades after but so you never really know if they are even thinking or knowing
3514168 please do not tell me that you think the iraqis did that
3514169 the use of reason allows for a legitimate diversity in our prudential judgments
3514170 these choices include elective abortion euthanasia physician assisted suicide the destruction of embryonic human beings in stem cell research human cloning and same sex marriage
3514171 such acts are judged to be intrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life as well as marriage and family
3514172 in light of the above we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
3514173 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity

3514184 we anticipated from the start that jimmy would start on the top of that bracket and so far hes remained there
3514185 he seems to be getting a little more comfortable and a little better actually with each practice
3514186 i think that in any circumstance with any person that quality or the lack of that quality is much more easily observed than it is to put a specific definition on it

3514214 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3514215 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3514216 we cannot continue with a situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to the problem
3514217 there are no reports of an american troop being killed
3514218 at least 127 american military instructors were in georgia at the beginning of the conflict there were joint training sessions that happened right before the start of the conflict
3514219 if we need to do dna tests we will do it
3514220 they were specifically to train them for a coming operation iraqi freedom deployment
3514221 there are no reports of an american troop being killed
3514222 in a changing marketplace emphasizing fuel economy technology cadillac is proud to be the only luxury brand offering a hybrid in this segment
3514223 we really wanted this functionality for yahoo services but by opening it up for the rest of the web consumers are more likely to adopt it
3514224 were not saying this is the end of the diablo universe but we are trying to bring this storyline to a close
3514225 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from diablo ii but from diablo i we feel like a lot of the focus is on diablo ii but diablo i started it all and has a lot of really good stuff on the gameplay side and on the character side so people can expect to see characters from diablo i more characters from diablo ii and characters from some of the books were definitely going to bring a few of them in
3514226 high incidence of dropped calls switching onto the slower at amp t nyse message board edge network while the device is stationary and loss of reception while in good coverage
3514227 while we have corrected limited toos spring merchandising difficulties the macroeconomic trends we began to see affecting limited too in the last several quarters accelerated dramatically in the second quarter
3514228 we dont see these macroeconomic trends changing anytime soon and believe we will be well positioned to capitalize on these trends through our single store brand strategy
3514229 we think much of the near term upside is reflected in the stock
3514230 our rating change today is merely valuation oriented as the stock has made an impressive run during the past couple months

3514240 i remember when in the center of west roxbury they added a pinball place to the bowling alley it quickly went from older people playing bowling to teenagers hanging around the backs of the building

3514244 theres no doubt about it we picked up several from different parts of the planet took them aboard our recon vessels and probed them all the way through theyre completely meat
3514245 thats impossible what about the radio signals the messages to the stars
3514246 they use the radio waves to talk but the signals dont come from them the signals come from machines
3514247 so who made the machines thats who we want to contact
3514248 they made the machines thats what im trying to tell you meat made the machines
3514249 thats ridiculous how can meat make a machine youre asking me to believe in sentient meat
3514250 im not asking you im telling you these creatures are the only sentient race in that sector and theyre made out of meat
3514251 maybe theyre like the orfolei you know a carbon based intelligence that goes through a meat stage
3514252 nope theyre born meat and they die meat we studied them for several of their life spans which didnt take long do you have any idea whats the life span of meat
3514253 spare me okay maybe theyre only part meat you know like the weddilei a meat head with an electron plasma brain inside
3514254 nope we thought of that since they do have meat heads like the weddilei but i told you we probed them theyre meat all the way through
3514255 oh theres a brain all right its just that the brain is made out of meat thats what ive been trying to tell you
3514256 youre not understanding are you youre refusing to deal with what im telling you the brain does the thinking the meat
3514257 thinking meat youre asking me to believe in thinking meat
3514258 yes thinking meat conscious meat loving meat dreaming meat the meat is the whole deal are you beginning to get the picture or do i have to start all over
3514259 thank you finally yes they are indeed made out of meat and theyve been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years
3514260 first it wants to talk to us then i imagine it wants to explore the universe contact other sentiences swap ideas and information the usual
3514261 thats the idea thats the message theyre sending out by radio hello anyone out there anybody home that sort of thing
3514262 they actually do talk then they use words ideas concepts
3514263 they do but what do you think is on the radio meat sounds you know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise they talk by flapping their meat at each other they can even sing by squirting air through their meat
3514264 omigod singing meat this is altogether too much so what do you advise
3514265 officially we are required to contact welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in this quadrant of the universe without prejudice fear or favor unofficially i advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing
3514266 it seems harsh but there is a limit do we really want to make contact with meat
3514267 i agree one hundred percent whats there to say hello meat hows it going but will this work how many planets are we dealing with here
3514268 just one they can travel to other planets in special meat containers but they cant live on them and being meat they can only travel through c space which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim infinitesimal in fact
3514269 so we just pretend theres no one home in the universe
3514270 cruel but you said it yourself who wants to meet meat and the ones who have been aboard our vessels the ones you probed youre sure they wont remember
3514271 theyll be considered crackpots if they do we went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that were just a dream to them
3514272 a dream to meat how strangely appropriate that we should be meats dream
3514273 good agreed officially and unofficially case closed any others anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy
3514274 yes a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in g445 zone was in contact two galactic rotations ago wants to be friendly again
3514275 and why not imagine how unbearably how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone

3514278 the response of students in bed colleges this year has been disappointing we have to take corrective measures we have decided that the admission process will be done again for this course we will soon announce the dates of selling of form that the students can fill admission process will be conducted like before
3514279 admissions will be initiated from the start but sfis which want to be a part of this re admission process will have to pay a fee of rs 25 000 to the university as development fund
3514280 we had demanded that re admissions be done without bending any rules the cut off of 45 per cent should be maintained and the quota for other universities should be untouched as well
3514281 the deceased has left behind a suicide note which says that nobody is to be blamed for his suicide and also that marital discord was not a reason for the extreme act
3514282 a complaint of accidental death has been registered at the satellite police station we are investigating into the causes behind his suicide
3514283 mohanty dreamed of setting up a school in orissa this was not materializing which had added to his depression
3514284 his wife has been away for almost a month mohantys body was found on tuesday hanging by a nylon rope from a ceiling fan but the exact time of death is still not known
3514285 the body has been sent for postmortem to ascertain the cause and time of death
3514286 other family members of the deceased in orissa have also been intimated and they are on their way
3514287 a basic level of awareness has to be achieved among visitors who visit our buildings and among amc employees
3514288 people find that their problems get sorted out quickly when they come here thats why the temple has been dubbed high court of kungher now thats how its commonly referred to
3514289 the village has had a small shrine for the goddess for more than two decades but it was considered evil and people were frightened to come near it now people are showing tremendous faith in chudel mata and her popularity is soaring by the day
3514290 lax enforcement of environmental laws in mexico would provide an added incentive for u s industries to relocate
3514291 the system designed to ensure that mexico domiciled carriers comply with u s motor vehicle manufacturing safety standards is incomplete and it is not clear whether the drug and alcohol testing program is functional the inspector general found
3514292 nafta would lead to an immediate and continuous reduction in mexican immigrants
3514293 it would lead to a steady reduction in the flow of undocumented workers from mexico to the us
3514294 some 2 million mexicans out of agriculture meanwhile corn based tortilla prices climbed by 50
3514295 firms like wal mart enter the mexican market and sell low priced goods made by ultra cheap labor in china to displace locally based shoe toy and candy firms an estimated 28 000 small and medium sized mexican businesses have been eliminated
3514296 corporations cut costs restructure on the corporate level corporations rationalize their cost cutting and restructuring through takeovers downsizing closure and relocations as the only means to stay competitive against their nafta partners government adds corporate breaks drops worker and environmental protections while macro policy tilts to capital away from labor

3514299 is wrong on the science wrong on our farmers needs
3514300 this is a very important time because people get to see these candidates up close and they recognize that it is only a relatively short run until they have to make a decision
3514301 and for mccain it could be a period of time where he really gets an advantage in terms of coverage and exposure which he has not had over the course of this campaign yet
3514302 and it is likely to stay that way because this is an election that in effect is about whether obama can get over the threshold of acceptability at a time when people want change
3514303 and mccain is not the incumbent but he is much more closely identified as the status quo
3514304 there is a truism in american politics which is that the candidate who is able to define himself and define his opponent first wins the election
3514305 this is an election that is about senator obama and the question is who will be able to define senator obama for these voters we are talking about first and better senator obama or senator mccain
3514306 hillary clinton supporters are still not fully onboard with barack obama
3514307 just 72 percent of clinton supporters say they are going to vote for obama eighty five or 86 percent of the supporters of mccains former opponents are with him so obama has not quite closed the deal
3514308 weist du isch habe mitgebrachte echt korrekte sport machina f r olympia kannst du mit verlieren deine pfunde oder so weist du
3514309 nee isse keiner folterbank sieht aber fast so aus und wenn du swei stunde darinne gesessen hast denkst du es isse folterbank isse

3514314 first do no harm second if they cant pay do nothing
3514315 the anger against the police in kashmir is on expected lines
3514316 while they show restrain in tackling protests in jammu they shower bullets on peaceful protesters in the valley they are not adopting a single yardstick to handle the situation in both regions that is why we are angry with the police
3514317 people all over the world can now get live e darshan at the temples official website www somnath org initially this facility will be available on every monday but gradually it will be available round the clock
3514318 the temple trust tries to come up with innovative ideas to make things better for the devotees a project to install life size panels showing 3 d images of the 12 jyotirling has been initiated at a cost of rs 30 lakh
3514319 so what if you have guns it will not deter us from our goal
3514320 we would get supplies of feeds and fodders from gangyal based jammu and kashmir agro industries a state government undertaking however the factory has been closed because of the bandh
3514321 we tried to get them meat and other food items but we couldnt since shops across jammu are closed
3514322 the death of reshama is sad enough but the loss of raja has come as a personal shock for me as i had brought him from sunderbani in rajouri district in fact im the one who named him
3514323 the intvp inquiries are limited to determining whether the world bank groups own rules policies and procedures have been violated
3514324 if the pm then feels the need to hold a meeting with the all party delegation he may convene it on wednesday
3514325 the government will take steps to engage all the groups concerned from jammu as well as the kashmir valley in talks so that the issues could be resolved amicably to the satisfaction of all concerned
3514326 a fleet of armoured personnel carriers with camouflaged 40 millimetre guns quickly surrounded the olympic venues amid stepped up security yesterday morning and suddenly the tone of the beijing games took a nasty turn
3514327 its a very low bit rate so normally it should play just fine

3514329 now its up to pacquiao if he wants to do it or not
3514330 we gave in a bit on the last round of negotiations
3514331 this time around were not willing to make any further concessions
3514332 we started in my garage two years ago and were producing barrels today so things are moving pretty quickly
3514333 so these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3514334 scalability is really the critical issue if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3514335 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3514336 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3514337 its a neat idea and a good approach for them
3514338 rather than go back and try to do everything into one super integrated piece if you can do it and hit a target window for the market more power to you
3514339 by having internal architectures that pipeline the thing it does give them a performance boost over an individual version with the two 4870s
3514340 amd ati has been gaining momentum in the overall pc discrete graphics vendor market
3514341 as the first quarter of 2008 data in my file implies amd ati is after a tough 2007 turning its market share back around my understanding is that amd atis new products are gaining traction with pc oems original equipment manufacturers and graphics card makers
3514342 its hard to predict what nvidia will do they could do a board like amd has done or they could go to a more powerful single chip they have the gtx 280 and thats a pretty powerful board now and well just have to wait and see if they can get the gtx 3 to go faster
3514343 basically this is crossfire on one board so basically if you have two pci peripheral component interconnect slots in your computer you can put two of these boards in and end up with four gpus
3514344 each one of those chips is about 1 2 teraflops in compute power if you put eight of them in the board youre talking about a 10 teraflop supercomputer do the math with the board coming up at about 500 if you put four of them in there you spend 2 000 on the board and say you spend another 1 000 on your computer so you spend 3 000 for a 10 teraflop computer i think thats just astounding
3514345 its a nice trade for everybody the criminals get a little protection the russian government gets to have something happen without having their fingerprints on it thats the assumption like estonia we dont have links to the russian government but its not a fluke where we magically have this happen when a shooting war starts
3514346 this looks to me like more than just some grassroots hacktivist inspired attacks
3514347 but at the same time theres no way to link it to a state sponsored type of attack its somewhere in the middle it certainly has criminal elements
3514348 this was really targeted at preventing georgia from presenting its message to the world through its communications platform and the web
3514349 obviously the georgians can talk to reporters but as more and more communications move to the internet with distributed blogs and all that all the attacks that have happened were targeted at preventing georgia from quickly and easily presenting the facts or their spin on whats going on
3514350 anywhere you have organized crime they leap in to take advantage of the news of the day
3514351 if theres an armed conflict between two nations and there are criminals in both nations they would leap to take advantage of that dont you think
3514352 building the facility in manhattan will put resources at the fingertips of federal researchers and vice versa
3514353 collaboration will more quickly render viable solutions to todays animal and agricultural disease problems so that america prospers
3514354 when you consider extensive agricultural heritage and its central location as well as a region that is clearly committed in its actions to grow the biosciences kansas simply rises to the top
3514355 a line of posts should be appointed under the direction of the postmaster general from falmouth in new england to savannah in georgia with as many cross posts as he shall think fit
3514356 are we correct that all cultural values are being destroyed or are they once again changing under the press of circumstance and from their own internal dynamics while we the anthropologists disapprove of the changes or at least do not comprehend them to argue globally against cultural change is a startling position to accept all change as good is mindless and cruel the challenge as yet unmet is to conceptualize communities as a complex process of stability and change and then to factor in the changes tourism brings to this end the evaluation of tourism cannot be accomplished by measuring the impact of tourism against a static background some of what we see as destruction is construction some is the result of a lack of any other viable option and some the result of choices that could be made differently which is which is by no means an easy matter to decide but is clear that anthropologists have not yet met these problems head on

3514403 en argentina el gobierno nacional suele hacer pagos generosos en concepto de publicidad a periodistas que escriben en medios gr ficos nacionales influyentes pero que tienen programas de radio o tv por cable con bajos niveles de rating
3514404 el precio del silencio abuso de publicidad oficial y otras formas de censura indirecta en am rica latina
3514405 nuestra investigaci n indic que la asignaci n injustificada de publicidad oficial al peri dico argentino de alcance nacional p gina 12 realizada durante los a os 2004 y 2005 que document ramos en una censura sutil persisti a lo largo de los dos a os siguientes
3514406 en 2006 y 2007 se ala el gobierno nacional volvi a otorgar a p gina 12 un monto altamente desproporcionado
3514407 la publicidad oficial o puede justificarse por la circulaci n de dicho matutino ni por cualquier otra ventaja competitiva
3514408 desde el ex presidente kirchner asumi el poder p gina 12 adopt por lo general una l nea editorial pro gobierno
3514409 el gobierno de n stor kirchner tambi n realiz asignaciones publicitarias excesivamente generosas a una variedad de medios en la provincia de santa cruz propiedades de rudy ulloa su ex chofer
3514410 los marcos jur dicos que rigen la compra de publicidad por parte del estado en todos los pa ses bajo an lisis resultan insuficientes e inadecuados carecen de las reglas y criterios que asegurar an asignaciones publicitarias transparentes y justas y no logran establecer las garant as necesarias en contra de posibles abusos
3514411 la falta de transparencia que existe en el proceso de contrataci n de la pauta oficial en especial si se combina con una centralizaci n de la toma de decisiones en la persona de funcionarios designados pol ticamente conduce a abusos pol ticamente motivados en la asignaci n de publicidad oficial y a un control m nimo o inexistente por parte de los ciudadanos y la sociedad civil
3514412 por otra parte el surgimiento de las compa as multinacionales ofrece una base pr ctica para el futuro desarrollo mundial ya que est n mas interesados en las realidades del servicio comercial e industrial que en los s mbolos de la soberan a no existe prueba de que pueda constituirse un orden internacional efectivo y duradero tomando como centro de unidad pol tica denominada naci n estado

3514414 i am outraged that this suspect was released from custody
3514415 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3514416 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3514417 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
3514418 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment
3514419 this kind of stunt really is a black eye for the restaurant itself
3514420 in the last decade these factors have accounted for nearly 100 of californias population growth
3514421 if we want to start healing our environment weve got to slow population growth
3514422 with americas population growing at its current rate every time we make an environmental gain our population increases and the gains are erased reducing immigration is the key to slowing future population growth and recapturing the momentum in the battle to save californias natural treasures its time for california to lead the rest of the country on this issue
3514423 when hard choices must be made for the greater good
3514424 if the border patrol doesnt get you the chicken and burgers will go vegan
3514425 we think that mexicans and other immigrants should be warned if they cross into the u s they are putting their health at risk by leaving behind a healthier staple diet of corn tortillas beans rice fruits and vegetables
3514426 the fencing being put in place is in many cases mesh fencing to allow our officers to see whats happening on the other side and to better secure the border
3514427 might even be frightening enough to deter people from crossing into the u s
3514428 it is customary that ice works with our law enforcement partners in the u s and in foreign countries providing support and information as each situation warrants
3514429 in the reyes case specifically ice provided support in coordinating interviews with mexican police and witnesses who were american citizens on the u s side of the border
3514430 well im sure you got more detailed information from our press secretary about the precise nature of our activity in this international investigation that involved activity on both sides of the border
3514431 so ice gets involved in law enforcement investigations when they involve activity on both sides of the border whether that activity involves spending money the use of phone cards other sorts of things then we are involved with our foreign counterparts
3514432 and that happens in all kinds of cases on a routine basis but i think i would need to direct you to kelly nantel our press secretary for the specifics of what we actually did in this case and then how it was consistent with our general practice on international involvement
3514433 i would also note that you know its my understanding and you should confirm with her its my understanding though that we were not quote unquote involved in the release of the we did merely provide some space for mexican local law enforcement
3514434 ice provided support in coordinating interviews with mexican police and witnesses who were american citizens on the u s side of the border
3514435 were doing this to be vigilant on the immigrant families who are under attack from the police who are illegally working with immigration
3514436 we have uncovered cases of harsh accusations such as a dui to a person who was not driving a vehicle and
3514437 one understands that when a law is broken we have to pay for what we did
3514438 but my husband has done nothing illegal so his being held prisoner does not make sense
3514439 law enforcement operations like this should reassure the public that ice is committed to putting public safety first every individual targeted as part of this operation has a criminal record
3514440 criminal aliens should be on notice that ice is working closely with local law enforcement to take off the streets those who threaten the very safety of our neighborhoods
3514441 we appreciate the efforts of immigration and customs enforcement in its efforts to remove illegal individuals with extensive criminal records from our community
3514442 indicative of the ability of the agencies to work cooperatively together to achieve a common goal of public safety in our community
3514443 i would like to commend and thank all the law enforcement agencies on the local state and federal level who participated in this effort gang related activities and those who choose to partake in them do so knowing full well the negative impact their actions can have on the neighborhoods throughout our fine city we hope this weeks arrests will call attention to our never ending commitment to combat suppress and prevent future gang related behavior
3514444 in diplomacy strategy and geopolitics our political leaders have been guilty of multiple failures over many years
3514445 lor al believes the court to be mistaken in its decision to minimise the role of ebay in the sale of products on its platform
3514446 lor al believes that this judgment by the court digresses from the interpretation of the ecommerce directive provided in recent months by the european commission lor al intends to appeal this decision
3514447 i think hes a great trumpet player and when i went to his concert i was just overwhelmed with emotion and how much he puts into his songs and just how personal they really touch your heart

3514453 its not good for the dogs but it also doesnt give a great impression for people that are coming down here
3514454 i feel like we are on schedule for the most part but on the other hand i feel almost a little behind answering some questions that we have to address
3514455 ive learned a lot but i dont think we have answers yet for piecing the puzzle together but all things considered three days into practice i feel like we are pretty ready to play a few years ago i was teaching skills at this point instead of getting ready to play
3514456 we have a few little things but nothing of significance they are sore they have been going hard so we took it easy today and will go at it again tomorrow
3514457 she is extremely low maintenance very coachable and loves to play we have had really good setting around here for a while and thats not going to change one ounce our fans are going to love what they see
3514458 we are trying to create ways to play to our strengths
3514459 we are trying to play a little more to hoopers strengths so we have to find ways to create some things that are more conducive to her style i dont want to admit we have holes since we are so deep it seems like when you admit to having holes its because you have personnel issues but we dont have that we have a lot of players and a lot of talent we should be able to have six rotations of prolific offense and that is what i am trying to get
3514460 when abbey and sarah left they were four year starters and they obviously took on a huge leadership role
3514461 but i feel like instead of losing that they handed it off to a whole bunch of people so you have a group of seven or eight players who all fall into that role now they have matured and they all get along this group just has harmony

3514485 the trouble is that when youre young you dont know enough you are constantly being lied to in a hundred ways so your idea of what the world is like are jumbled when you imagine the life you want for yourself you imagine things that dont exist if i could have gone back and explained to my younger self what the real options were what the real consequences for certain decisions were going to be my younger self would have known what to choose but at the time i didnt know and now when i knew my mind was to filled up with useless auxiliary information and beholden to special interests and i was confused

3514496 it could indeed be said that pauls own claims to be an apostle with a distinctive new or different emphasis in his gospel had to be put to the same test and had to pass it if his apostleship and missionary work were not to be judged unacceptable variations of the gospel of jesus christ this is the clear implication of galatians 1 2 where paul having insisted on the independence of his apostolic authority from the jerusalem apostles nevertheless found it necessary to go up to jerusalem to lay his gospel before the leading apostles lest somehow i was running or had run in vain 2 2 despite his confidence that he was called by christ paul recognized the necessity that his claim to exceptional revelation gal 1 12 had to be tested and accepted by those who represented the temporal continuity with jesus which also implies that pauls repeated insistence that he was indeed an apostle was in effect a claim to belong to that body which had responsibility to authenticate as well as to preach the gospel 1 cor 15 8 11 in the light of all this it must be judged unlikely that paul for one woul dhave accepted any prophetic utterance as a word of jesus simply because it was an inspired prophetic utterance

3514650 in fact maybe because of the troubled economy they are finding our message content and the opportunity to network with each other more important than ever the pressure on compliance and ethics professionals has never been greater as companies struggle to meet their goals in tough times without cutting corners
3514651 the compliance and ethics institutes agenda was developed to provide the knowledge needed to navigate these challenging times and help our members grow in their careers

3514663 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3514664 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3514665 its the most exciting thing on the horizon and its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3514666 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are in to it its been a fun thing
3514667 but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right
3514668 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3514669 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3514670 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3514671 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3514672 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3514673 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3514674 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3514675 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3514676 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3514677 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man

3514679 im ok with it my voice was used in the performance i think thats enough
3514680 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
3514681 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
3514682 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
3514683 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic
3514684 there are things that we did with watchmen that could only work in a comic

3514696 ability is what you are capable of doing motivation determines what you do attitude determines how well you do it
3514697 this is absurd going into a crowd of people like that and shooting
3514698 to think people would use the occasion to carry out such a senseless senseless crime is shocking

3514702 heres a child that could have been killed too the thing about it is you feel helpless
3514703 i believe everyone in the city feels this type of violence and it has to stop
3514704 theres a fear factor throughout the city and no neighborhood is left unscathed im a firm believer that this is due to the influx of guns into hartford the kids know where to get them
3514705 it seems the youth involved in these incidents are getting younger and younger it just looks like they were shooting randomly all over the place who was the target
3514706 if it was a beef why hurt so many innocent people i dont understand it
3514707 we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame
3514708 i dont know the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3514709 i dont want to name names even though he probably deserves it but he fooled around
3514710 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you
3514711 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3514712 if i say i am not going to succeed im a loser then thats what i am going to be if we say were kings and we say were queens thats what were going to be it has nothing to do with being arrogant

3514724 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3514725 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide

3514752 i just heard tonight that bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
3514753 osama bin laden has just decreed death to all jews and all americans
3514754 language similar to the text of the anthrax letters postmarked two weeks later warning death to america death to israel
3514755 this is next take penacilin sic now death to america death to israel allah is great
3514756 were fighting them there so we dont have to fight them over here
3514757 the government is still searching for evidence that bruce ivins was solely responsible for the 2001 anthrax attacks despite declaring the case solved
3514758 he didnt know it until it was too late and it had already been spreading
3514759 we were talking and we said we ought to do this date for hosie
3514760 were always talking about hosie hes the granddaddy of the fresno blues musicians hell be 80 this year so we thought it was time we gave him a tribute
3514761 you can find a lot of people who say they play the blues but they aint no blues bands
3514762 most of them dont know what the blues is all about they just play songs me i love it

3514766 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3514767 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3514770 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3514771 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3514772 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3514773 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3514774 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3514775 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3514776 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3514777 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3514778 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3514779 ever since i was 15 years old and first picked up a pen i always wanted my poetry to address issues which were important but nobody around me was talking about im excited to present this collection because it challenges this idea of poet as rock star and emphasizes the poets role as witness and story teller

3514793 it has been three months now since the cyclone hit and there is still much work to do such as distributing family kits organizing child friendly spaces providing safe water supplies and immunizing children
3514794 this operation will last at least one year and depends on continued access to the affected areas
3514795 the recovery operation is going well but there remain many challenges and we will continue our relief efforts as long as necessary
3514796 but the catastrophe has also opened several doors education is a very good example of where we can make a bigger difference
3514797 i was amazed by the resilience of the affected populations and by the sense of community in myanmar society communities have begun remarkable recovery efforts in the face of enormous difficulties
3514798 we have just been having a real busy last few days
3514799 my father taught me how to work and my mother taught me how to dream
3514800 i dont know which is more important for young people
3514801 i told people the joy of starting a business and having to borrow money to meet payroll makes you grow up
3514802 we must find ways to significantly cut wasteful government spending
3514803 with the loss of other senior members of our louisiana delegation this year now more than ever we need sen landrieus experience and seniority in congress so that she can continue making a difference in our state
3514804 mary landrieu may be popular with party bosses and association higher ups but we know that sheriffs who are fighting on the front lines will be standing with john kennedy in november
3514805 shes been there a long time and we really need to hold on to her seniority

3514811 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3514812 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3514813 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3514814 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3514815 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3514816 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3514817 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3514818 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3514819 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3514820 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3514821 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3514822 letzter versuch der besuch eines der wie schwammerln aus dem boden wachsenden in lokale
3514823 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3514824 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3514825 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3514826 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3514827 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3514828 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3514829 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3514830 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3514831 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3514832 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3514833 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3514834 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3514835 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3514836 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3514837 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3514838 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3514839 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3514840 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3514841 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3514842 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3514843 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3514844 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3514845 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3514846 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3514847 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3514848 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3514849 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3514850 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3514851 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3514852 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3514853 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3514854 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3514855 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3514856 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

3514858 besides ang kapakanan ng show ang iniisip naming mga judge at yung mga taong naniniwala sa credibility ng pinoy idol ayaw naming masira ang reputasyon ng competition kaya maingat din kami pinag aaralan naming mabuti ang judgment na ibinibigay namin

3514863 nagkaisa lang talaga kami nina ogie at wyngard na hindi isali si gretchen sa tatlo dahil ang pinagbabasehan naman namin ay yung performance nila at kung paano sila na develop at iba pang bagay na ginawa nila para mag improve pa sa duration ng contest

3514869 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3514870 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3514871 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3514872 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3514873 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3514875 when i was 12 or 13 years old she had told me that in 18th century japan the geisha who were known for their beauty and their porcelain skin needed something to remove all the heavy make up they wore

3514878 when i explain to my customers they think i misspoke because of my accent
3514879 but after they understand many of them are willing to trust me and give it a try
3514880 she e mailed me some information i definitely needed to know more before i committed to the procedure
3514881 but then i thought about it and the japanese have been doing it for such a long time and the geishas have such beautiful skin even though they put such harsh chemicals on it
3514882 it doesnt feel as abrasive as some other facials and it smells organic
3514883 and it doesnt tingle or burn it just sort of stays there its a really simple calming facial

3514939 shunning is often used as a pejorative term to describe any organizationally mandated disassociation and has acquired a connotation of abuse and relational aggression this is due to the sometimes extreme damage caused by its disruption to normal relationships between individuals such as friendships and family relations disruption of established relationships certainly causes pain which is at least an unintended consequence of the practices described here though it may also in many cases be an intended coercive consequence extremes of this cross over the line into psychological torture and can be permanently scarring

3514948 net broadband additions in the quarter were the fewest of any quarter in the seven years leichtman research group has been tracking the industry
3514949 the decline in additions this quarter compared to the same period last year was exacerbated by verizon and at amp ts emphasis on selling higher speed fios and u verse bundled services often at the expense of traditional dsl service
3514950 its easy to take prices down but its very hard to bring them back up
3514951 its worth noting that the telcos stopped promoting their broadband plans in the second quarter because thats when students are leaving school and disconnecting its a seasonal disconnect period its overly simplistic to say broadband subscriber growth slowed down because of this or that just a few years ago the telecom providers were criticized for offering 15 dsl service

3514955 we are witnessing in this crisis the birth of true operational cyber warfare

3514966 i am no longer in that relationship a lot of you keep asking me why my profile says single and why i seem sad lately so before you read it in some dumb article or online let me be the first to say it we broke up about 2 weeks ago
3514967 we are still friends we are just trying to give each other some space i will always love him this is a hard time for both of us

3514994 the role of these codes is to protect healthcare consumers by providing a solid regulatory framework for nurses and midwives and ensuring they are competent to practice
3514995 the launch is important to nurses and midwives who are accountable to the community for providing quality care through safe and effective professional work practices
3514996 the wide involvement of nurses and midwives in reviewing and developing the codes demonstrates how seriously these professionals take their responsibility to the public

3514999 the burkes offered to renew hdrs lease in the building but to a different suite requiring hdr to move from its then present first floor suite to the second floor of the building
3515000 in reliance on the burkes representation to hdr that it could purchase the building in the future hdr decided to terminate its negotiations with a potential seller of property and enter a new lease with the burkes
3515001 expressly provided that hdr could purchase the building within the first year of the lease for the purchase price of 300 000
3515002 in reliance on this purchase option hdr invested significant sums to make modifications to the second floor space adding electrical and air conditioning capacity bringing natural gas connectivity to the back of the building for new emergency power generating equipment and replicating its enormous database and server network in the new space to accommodate the move
3515003 the burkes inexplicably refused to sell the building to the company despite the purchase option

3515013 im convinced from talking to her that shes been grossly overcharged
3515014 she did not in any way initiate or cause the death of her son and we are going to i think have a very easy time proving that
3515015 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots she bought the program hook line and sinker
3515016 our study found that combat deployment in support of the wars in iraq and afghanistan was significantly associated with new onset heavy weekly drinking binge drinking and other alcohol related problems among reserve guard and younger personnel after return from deployment
3515017 because alcohol use may serve as a coping mechanism after traumatic events it is plausible that deployment is associated with increased rates of alcohol consumption or problem drinking
3515018 i think this study is probably very accurate as part of the re entry process people will turn to coping mechanisms that are easily accessible and alcohol is easily available socially acceptable and quite effective for short term stress relief
3515019 surround yourself with people you can talk to and establish a support system that isnt tied to a bar

3515031 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today

3515037 i try to promote bipartisanship but thats not what the other side wants
3515038 though decades of economic research suggest men and women are equalizing in the labor market the notion that todays working women are being paid more and treated better than ever before is simply wrong
3515039 the growing equality between genders reflects the entry of the most able women to the workforce rather than better pay while there may be more women holding high power positions today they are still being paid as their counterparts were three decades ago
3515040 a women who is abused by her husband is truly placed in a situation of double jeopardy regarding hiv infection in that his sexual behavior outside of the marriage makes it more likely he is infected with the virus and his abusive behavior inside the marriage leaves her with little control over sex or sexual protection
3515041 those clinicians working to prevent hiv infection among their female patients should consider violence from male partners as an important risk factor and ask about and attempt to intervene in such abuse to reduce this risk
3515042 more critically major national and global hiv prevention programs must include reducing mens ipv perpetration as a key target in the fight to stem the epidemic
3515043 this study should serve as a wake up call to us all if we as policymakers and practitioners are going to be truly successful in addressing the spread of hiv in india we must think of ways to address the all too widespread mistreatment of wives
3515044 intimate partner violence and hiv infection among married indian women
3515045 this paper and the work that this group has done on reconsolidation and drug taking behaviors represent some of the most promising avenues of research for treating addiction
3515046 i dont know of any other study in the field of drug addiction where an acute treatment causes long term cessation of drug taking behavior in rodent models
3515047 this is an example of hypothesis driven basic research that can be readily translated to the treatment of cocaine addiction in humans
3515048 im concerned now that you brought it to my attention
3515049 i didnt know they were doing it and i dont know the ramifications
3515050 i dont like being forced to use ethanol in my motorcycles and cars car manufacturers for years have said limit usage of ethanol and theyre saying it for a reason
3515051 were fielding two questions that we dont know how to answer
3515052 idahoans want to know why our pump prices are so high compared to other states and if there are any stations where they can buy gasoline without ethanol as near as we can tell most of the gasoline being pumped out of this region is quietly and very quickly switched over to ethanol
3515053 were asking idahoans calling for a list to become reporters and let us know which stations in idaho serve regular grade gasoline without ethanol
3515054 motorists are right when they say there should be enough transparency in the marketplace that they know what theyre getting when they pull up to a fuel pump
3515055 putting it on the gas tax isnt the best way to go

3515284 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor

3515329 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them

3515355 with good government support for small scale farmers we can easily reach 3 0 million to 5 0 million tonnes within two to seasons

3515370 bill is a non conformist hes a maverick hes a very provocative teacher
3515371 what seems to be the provocateur for all of this is the idea that debaters are allowed to strike two judges and in this case there were five judges and the florida state university team struck two judges who had given them low scores in the past one of them happened to be a black female and that set the thing off

3515527 leach as you may recall lost his bid for re election in 2006 after three decades representing portions of eastern iowa in congress
3515528 no to crossrail hole plot in london say no to big business crossrail hole agenda no to crossrail bill uk parliament
3515529 im sure greens on the assembly would be happy to offer advice to mr johnson
3515530 but the danger with boris johnson is the way the constituencies are set up means they the tories dont need anyones votes to get their budget we would talk to them but they wouldnt have to talk to us
3515531 i saw very little in boriss manifesto which was really getting to the heart of the matter i saw a lot about trees a lot about graffiti thats the environment as far as tories seem to be concerned theres not the concrete measures to tackle the major carbon emissions in london
3515532 were getting more out of it than he mr livingstone is
3515533 weve described a second preference vote for ken as an insurance against boris
3515534 were not expressing massive endorsement of ken or labour in any way
3515535 youve got to look at who is likely to be in the final round and its those two so youve got to chose between them ken livingstone would be less of a disaster than boris johnson
3515536 weve not even slightly had a discussion about anything that might happen after the election
3515537 most of the flights are short haul for which there are alternatives so i dont think it would be an enormous loss to the city
3515538 we definitely wouldnt let them expand if they did hang in there the earliest chance wed get is in about eight years when the leases on other parts of the land the gla owns cannot be renewed and then it would actually have to close
3515539 if youre just going to make a short speech is that better done by video youve got to look at all those options
3515540 theres time and money involved as well as carbon emissions on some occasions yes you would have to go to places that you cant reach but i think most of europe is accessible by train
3515541 we have some of the worst insulated homes in the country
3515542 it is impossible for londoners to have a decent quality of life if the environment is polluted noisy poorly maintained and under threat locally and globally we need to be vigilant against pressures to turn everything outside zone 2 into a suburban sprawl new developments should be on previously used land only with our green spaces preserved
3515543 i dont think you can bring punitive measures at the top end without bringing in incentives to switch to the bottom end what you may find is that people go out and buy band b cars and have their discount taken away after a year and people will feel cheated i wouldnt extend the zone further the low emissions zone is absolutely necessary about 1 000 people a year die because of our poor air quality
3515544 youve got young people getting involved in gangs because local councils have cut their funding for youth services they have overcrowded homes so they have no choice but to be on the streets but i think its got to be down to them adults cant predict what young people like to do
3515545 for city employees who are on massive bonuses and own substantial amounts of property there is a ceiling on how much council tax you can pay we ought to have different ways of raising money either through business rates or local income tax my main policy is to raise the wages of the lowest paid
3515546 this is about future proofing londons economy at the moment we are relying completely on financial services and the washover like leisure and entertainment were totally reliant on fuel for transport so when the economy changes when financial services take a dive and fuel prices go up and up london is going to be in trouble unless we have new industries ready
3515547 manual transmission orbase meant the transporting of ballot boxes containing the printout copy of the electronic voting records and of flash disks containing electronic copies of the votes cast
3515548 problems occurred perhaps because the system was new there were even subcenters where the machine did not work and usb flash disks were brought to the main consolidation centers they still had the manual transmission
3515549 the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter
3515550 in contrast the rest of our businesses did not exhibit the same dynamics as our desktop business
3515551 the notebook gpu mcp and professional solutions groups grew a combined 27 percent year over year

3515601 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3515602 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3515603 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3515604 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3515605 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3515606 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3515607 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3515608 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

3515614 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3515615 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3515616 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3515617 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3515618 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3515619 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3515620 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales

3515624 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3515625 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3515626 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3515627 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3515628 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3515629 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3515630 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3515631 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3515632 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3515633 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3515634 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial

3515700 for nearly a decade i wrote a fictional column in the financial times about a senior manager who spoke almost entirely in business cliches martin lukes talked the talk or rather he added value by reaching out and sharing his blue sky thinking at the end of the day he stepped up to the plate and delivered world class jargon that really pushed the envelope after eight years of being him i came to accept the nouns pretending to be verbs to task and to impact even the new verb to architect i almost took in my stride i didnt even really mind the impenetrable sentences full of leveraging value and paradigm shifts but what still rankled after so long were the little things that he said myself instead of me and that he would never talk about a problem when he could dialogue around an issue instead
3515701 i wonder how many goals we could score if immediately after picking one up i went to a 3 4 3 and pushed forward while the other team is still recovering hmmm

3515718 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3515719 i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict
3515720 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia
3515721 weve just seen over the last few days as the russians invaded a sovereign nation georgia and watched the response of this man john mccain to that crisis right strong clear principled the kind of president we need in the white house
3515722 which brings oil from the caspian to points west and traverses georgia thats the very pipeline that the russians tried to bomb
3515723 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
3515724 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire
3515725 si el ahora fallecido ivins fue realmente el culpable tras los ataques
3515726 significar a que el ntrax provino de un laboratorio del gobierno de ee uu enviado por un destacado cient fico del ej rcito de ee uu en fort detrick sin recurrir en absoluto a ninguna especulaci n o inferencia es dif cil exagerar la importancia de ese hecho desde el comienzo hubo una clara intenci n por parte del atacante con ntrax de crear un v nculo entre los ataques con ntrax radicales isl micos y los ataques del 11 s
3515727 mucho m s importante que el intento de vincular el ntrax con terroristas isl micos es que hubo una intenci n espec fica con la ayuda indispensable de abc news de vincular a iraq y sadam husein con los ataques con ntrax
3515728 eso significa que las cuatro fuentes bien posicionadas y separadas
3515729 el mismo laboratorio del gobierno de donde provinieron los ataques con ntrax fue el sitio en el que se originaron los informes falsos que culparon a iraq por esos ataques seguramente la pregunta de quien gener esos falsos informes sobre ntrax de iraq es una de las historias m s importantes y explosivas de la ltima d cada
3515730 y sin embargo incre blemente se guardan la historia para s mismos y se niegan a revelar qui n lo hizo todo se supone que sean una organizaci n de noticias en posesi n de una de las historias noticiosas m s importantes de la ltima d cada pero la ocultan al p blico incluso a os despu s
3515731 he saw three letters a k a g and a b
3515732 its particularly a moment where john mccain can claim to have been prescient
3515733 david broder is this a 3 a m moment for foreign policy for these candidates
3515734 it is and its particularly a moment where john mccain can claim to have been prescient because in his basic foreign policy speech two months ago and in an interview that i did with him last week he draws a very sharp line when it comes to russia he says these people are being aggressive and imperialist there is no confusion in his mind about the character of the putin medvedev government and he is prepared i think to make the case that this is a demonstration of exactly what he has been arguing for
3515735 appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
3515736 when violence broke out in the caucasus friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position it has been a rough few weeks for mccain on the foreign policy front paging dr maliki but he appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
3515737 its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks
3515738 and its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks hes been in contact with the leaders involved in these places for many many years so its really sort of a perfect thing for him and so the question is each time something like this pops up randomly we may see a cautiousness on the one hand by senator obama who has not been dealing with these things for years and maybe a little more aggressive voice from senator mccain and ill just tell you his favorite thing to say about vladimir putin is when i look into his eyes i see a k a g and a b hes been very very tough on putin for quite some time
3515739 mccain was right about putin he warned about russia under putins ambitions he wanted russia excluded from the g 8
3515740 certainly their initial responses they were as you say different mr obamas initial response was to say that both should show restraint the invader and the invaded thats not whats going on here
3515741 certainly their initial responses they were as you say different mr obamas initial response was to say that both should show restraint the invader and the invaded thats not whats going on here what is going on here is an enormous world historic moment ballistic missiles according to the united states administration including plus a naval blockade tanks heavy artillery and strategic bombers operating by russia against a european nation
3515742 i know from my own reporting he does understand whats happening in that region hes been in georgia i know hes met with opposition leaders in georgia
3515743 mccain came out strong against russia almost as soon as the crisis in the caucasus ignited now more world leaders are there including bush and obama whose new statement casts the blame more clearly
3515744 the mindless slaughters being conducted by a russian military that seeks to reassert itself not only in the former soviet union but also to extend its reach throughout what used to be the former soviet union in an attempt to fold back into the russian empire those countries that have broken away from it most notably georgia
3515745 first lets talk about chechnya the chechen people are now subjected to a level of slaughter and massacre that we have not seen in europe perhaps since world war ii the mindless slaughters being conducted by a russian military that seeks to reassert itself not only in the former soviet union but also to extend its reach throughout what used to be the former soviet union in an attempt to fold back into the russian empire those countries that have broken away from it most notably georgia which is headed by one the great men in the history of the world mr shevardnadze also t his obviously has a great effect on the next election in russia the russian prime minister now is playing this to a great political gain the russians must be told that they will not only not be anymore imf funding there will not be any more export import funding and the united states will gauge its relations on the treatment of the chechnans because what is happening right now is an unconscionable set of circumstances which if allowed to continue will then encourage russia and the military to continue to this kind of expansion into the region and overthrow the embryonic nations that are there the russians have to understand that this is not something that we can turn a blind eye to and we must have it stopped otherwise it will have severe implications for our relations for years to come
3515746 im very concerned about mr putin im afraid mr putin might be one of those who wants to make the trains run on time
3515747 senator would you meet with assuming mr putin is elected in march would you want to meet with him as a candidate other candidates have gone overseas while running for office or right before the campaign begins
3515748 im not sure that would be necessary might be an interesting experience because i know whats going on in russia so do a whole lot of my friends well we know he was a apparatchik we know he was a member of the kgb we know that he came to power because of the military brutality and massacre that is taking place in russia today i mean in chechnya today we know that he worked a deal with yeltsin so that yeltsin would have immunity and he would be assured the presidency rather than basically a contested im very concerned abo ut mr putin im afraid mr putin might be one of those who wants to make the trains run on time so yeah i would meet with him as a candidate but i think that what i would really like to do is send a message to mr putin that we expect certain behavior out of the russians and particularly whats going on in chechnya today a cessation of that brutality and that its a very important strategic part of the world for us
3515749 i know how much hes done for vets like me
3515750 john kerry he goes to bat for all us vets
3515751 i dont think you have to be a mathematician to divine that senator kerrys early endorsement of senator obama put our opponent on the ballot
3515752 many of sen clintons supporters have made it clear that they wanted to register their displeasure with sen kerrys endorsement
3515753 i dont think im comfortable with either of those clowns
3515754 mccain would come across to russia as a stronger person someone with opinions they would listen to
3515755 he has shown he listens to people and he has an ability to synthesize opinion
3515756 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3515757 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3515758 i dont see how either mccain or obama has the experience to deal with this
3515759 obama doesnt know what hes talking about but i worry that mccain is too old
3515760 and just because someone was in a war doesnt mean theyll make a good president
3515761 mccain gave his usual knee jerk response full of testosterone and maybe obama showed some people he is not as seasoned on foreign policy
3515762 but what obama has going for him is that hes thoughtful
3515763 in the russians view theyll see obama as mr popularity telling them what to do they may listen to mccain
3515764 we had to be careful in the construction and really just be considerate of the building itself

3515774 you cant go for the knockout punch even against angola the united states is the deepest team in the field 12 guys wear down the opposition over 40 minutes thats the game plan

3515776 we thought barkley was a bit deranged it was not a sane reaction from a person playing basketball

3515873 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3515874 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3515875 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3515876 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3515893 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3515894 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3515895 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3515896 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3515897 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3515898 the premeditated slaying of john lennon with an essentially clear mind
3515899 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals

3515958 and what weve learned from our data is half of the people that we talked to did not have insurance most did not have a regular health care provider but when they found health care they generally felt they were treated fairly
3515959 even people who work in the industry in hotels they work specific hours in one hotel and they dont give them enough hours to be able to receive benefits so they work two part time jobs and they dont have insurance in any of them
3515960 the announcement was made five months ago but theyre still being meted out the same punishment

3515992 i thought i was going to show up and fight 10 guys but it was a football team that was the first time i ever played organized sports

3515995 i would go shag the balls put the bucket next to them and they would stand at second base i would throw one hoppers and they would catch and tag catch and tag hours and hours of doing that over the years
3515996 before we went home i would hit them fly balls
3515997 i could cut the ball and make it slice or make it take off so they could see it move and it helped them become outfielders
3515998 id say this game is not to catch the ball but to run to where you think the ball is going to go theyd turn and run to that spot and if the ball hit them depending on how many times it hit em theyd win an ice cream

3516010 the attorney general the nations top law enforcement officer seems intent on insulating this administration from accountability
3516011 does not mean as some people have suggested that those officials who were found by the joint reports to have committed misconduct have suffered no consequences far from it the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity

3516016 are adopting some of the same strategies being used in the private sector to attract higher paying patients and changing their image as a safety net provider
3516017 we found that physicians are stepping up efforts to build their own diagnostic and ambulatory surgery centers and therefore are becoming less dependent on hospitals as their workshops
3516018 the growth of single specialty medical groups has allowed physician practices the scale needed to offer services that are more profitable
3516019 allocate greater portions of their current and future profits to service growing debt which in turn means that fewer funds are available to support indigent care
3516020 hospitals efforts to limit growth in uncompensated care may be occurring indirectly by concentrating their expansion activities in more affluent communities and by downsizing or eliminating certain unprofitable services such as inpatient psychiatric units
3516021 were showing up with more serious health problems than in the past which they interpreted as another indication of worsening access in the community
3516022 access to specialty care continues to be the most serious and growing problem in most communities with mental health surgical dental and vision care frequently cited as the most difficult to obtain
3516023 queuing for appointments based on insurance coverage was another tactic being used by the safety net hospital with private insured patients waiting the least amount of time for an appointment and uninsured patients waiting the longest
3516024 more rigorously applying a sliding fee schedule becoming more aggressive in collecting out of pocket payments from uninsured patients verifying income and offering discounts to patients who pay up front
3516025 expanding insurance coverage is the most direct way to relieve some of the financial pressure on safety net providers
3516026 for example heightened public concern about the community benefit activities of tax exempt hospitals has prompted some states to enact laws that require minimum standards of charity care provision by hospitals
3516027 the idea that beauty is unimportant or a cultural construct is the real beauty myth we have to understand beauty or we will always be enslaved by it
3516028 whats been done so far is encouraging but i dont have the sense that congress is looking to take anything to the next step at this point in time
3516029 obama is a strong supporter of a packer ban his campaign says
3516030 when meatpackers own livestock they can manipulate prices and discriminate against independent farmers obama will strengthen anti monopoly laws and strengthen producer protections to ensure independent farmers have fair access to markets control over their production decisions and transparency in prices
3516031 in a time of high prices record prices for some feedstocks and for that matter high prices for livestock it is difficult to make the case that farmers and ranchers are getting the shaft
3516032 of course the reality is that they probably are but again politics is politics and presidential candidates are not known for making complex arguments
3516033 were a major employer an economic factor in their states
3516034 about their 30 percent being too much of a lock on the market
3516035 obviously leaves retailers and restaurants and ultimately consumers with significantly fewer competitive choices
3516036 this enormous consolidation in the beef processing industry is likely just to add to higher food prices at a time that consumers can least afford it
3516037 the positive identification has not significantly changed the status of the ongoing investigation

3516056 it was pretty steady all morning long then it slowed down
3516057 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3516058 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3516059 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3516060 we cannot continue with a situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to the problem
3516061 there are no reports of an american troop being killed
3516062 at least 127 american military instructors were in georgia at the beginning of the conflict there were joint training sessions that happened right before the start of the conflict

3516069 just the other day i saw a sneer on her face when i mentioned someone she doesnt like very well when you know someone all their life you can tell what theyre thinking by subtle movements in their face that others would miss
3516070 if we have information that that patients representative is not acting in that patients best interest then we will seek an outside party through the courts
3516071 if she signed that and wanted it at the time its obviously not what she wants now she wants to get well
3516072 the board and the staff are just very focused for every adoptable animal that comes to our shelter there is a home its our job just to find that home
3516073 i think being open seven days a week really had an effect
3516074 i also think with the advent of the internet more and more people are online our website www upaws org is updated every night with animals as they come up for adoption
3516075 the more animals that we have here the more time it takes to clean them make sure theyre getting exercise and generally taking care of them on a day to day basis

3516113 tribewanted promised a totally new type of partnership between a visiting group and a local group and for that a the project has totally delivered everyone who come here is blown away by the experience
3516114 to see how to bring fiji back people just need to visit vorovoro vorovoro is the way vorovoro is the way the world should be people from all ranks and places come here and enjoy the island and people and cry when they leave because this is the real fiji we are stronger when we do things together and right now we are a very strong tribe
3516115 vorovoro is more than just tourism it is a way of life now
3516116 to my mind vorovoro was and remains a bold and courageous experiment in profound inter cultural conscious evolution it strikes me that it is mutually beneficial we all felt changed and enriched by our vorovoro experience and integral to that is our sense that the islanders felt feel the same way
3516117 what really differentiates tribewanted from most other tourism initiatives is the way in which many of the tribe members work to positively impact things going on around them
3516118 to call tribewanted a case study for tourism would be like calling kava a beverage it runs much deeper than that the community being built on vorovoro is much more than just a place to travel to its a confluence of environmental sustainability personal responsibility travel cultural immersion exploration and collaboration
3516119 as members become so interested in our customs it makes us realise how important our culture is and makes us more aware in how we should preserve it
3516120 tribewanted has done a great job by providing and supporting the mali school children with books sports gear computers and also the electricity and water projects children are now able to study and drink water freely
3516121 tribewanted has done a great job so far in providing the community at large with the contributions they have done in jobs words and deeds they are also taking part in donations for church services and village callings as part of the village they present food items for any functions weddings funerals fundraisers holidays etc they have made us more proud of who we are by showing passion for the way we live and along with the jobs and education this has given us an advantage in our lives and confidence we didnt have before
3516122 from its grassroots beginning tribewanted has grown into a huge and long term idea that shows lives changing through social networking

3516159 this is an overall document which will be underlined and guaranteed by the u n security council

3516161 i expected an apology in which he admitted he got the whole thing wrong until that happens there will be no peace
3516162 the matter is not concluded yet and it is a lot better to try to make progress on these issues at a personal level rather than through the press

3516168 this whole genre of model programs sends a very strong message to young people that your main capacity for success in this world is to market yourself sexually
3516169 instead of being part of the solution this teacher is part of the problem
3516170 hes helping to generate these very very toxic messages that are driving young girls to body image problems and eating disorders and other psychological difficulties

3516174 have the courage to limit themselves and the clarity to set their priorities
3516175 the time a priest spends with the lord and therefore having time for prayer
3516176 to learn what is truly essential to learn where my presence is truly needed as a priest and where i cannot delegate to anybody and at the same time i should humbly accept that there are many things and moments that require my presence but that cannot be done because i recognise my own limitations i think that such humility will be understood by people
3516177 and with this there is something else i should understand how to delegate and call others to collaborate
3516178 a true community of brothers who should sustain and help one another
3516179 isolation in loneliness and sadness and therefore it is important we get together regularly

3516187 we view in russia an important element in the regional and global existence while we view georgia as a country with which we have friendly relations because of its experiences the state of israel should ensure that it does not intervene and that it does not abandon friends during their hour of need this is what we expected of our friends and this is what our friends expect of us and we all hope that matters there will be straightened out quickly
3516188 i think what happened to omri is an unfortunate incident he understands this he did not mean for the shooting to happen but we must be the ones who set the norms i view this as a failure at the command level and ive told omri this omri will change roles undergo the process he needs to undergo and i dont rule out the possibility that he could return to his position in the future

3516327 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3516328 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible
3516329 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3516330 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3516331 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3516332 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing

3516341 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3516342 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3516343 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3516344 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3516345 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3516346 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3516347 and hopefully some of us will hear the national anthem at the end of the week
3516348 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3516349 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3516350 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3516351 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency

3516361 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3516362 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3516363 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3516364 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning

3516395 die sicherheit der russischen friedenssoldaten und der russischen staatsb rger ist gew hrleistet
3516396 aus dem russischen blickwinkel ist das eine regional begrenzte milit rische operation mit berregionaler politischer wirkung
3516397 die russen wollten bereits seit langem ihre s dlichen grenzen sichern
3516398 und ich denke wir haben den rger moskaus ber das wachsende engagement der nato in russlands hinterhof untersch tzt
3516399 russland will einen regimewechsel aber bisher nicht mit milit rischen mitteln
3516400 sie haben nur milit rische ziele angegriffen was zeigt dass sie die regierung nicht milit risch st rzen wollen aber sicher f nden sie es besser wenn saakaschwili ersetzt w rde
3516401 russland wollte eine lektion erteilen und zwar nicht nur den georgiern
3516402 international m sste moskau dann mit einer weitreichenden verschlechterung der beziehungen rechnen deswegen haben sie sich darauf beschr nkt saakaschwili vor der ganzen welt zu dem tigen
3516403 russland hat dieses spiel gewonnen auch deshalb weil sie den krieg so kurz halten konnten
3516404 russland m chte sicherstellen dass georgien niemals der nato beitritt
3516405 theres a lot of human tragedy there because they wont be able to live very well

3516409 i think the gun fell and we both dove for it wrestled for it i picked it up and like he yanked it back behind his head and it went off
3516410 yeah this is way too demonstrative back away back away
3516411 the iraqis arent yet confident enough to stand entirely on their own al qaedas savagery still imposes too much fear while iran is training terrorists next door in counterinsurgency the people must know they are protected gen petraeus has proven that intimidation can be defeated by placing american soldiers among the population

3516423 in oklahoma we have mosquitoes the size of small sparrows i never heard another complaint after the bug bam arrived
3516424 not only did bug bam work it alleviated some of our main concerns regarding the insect issue the prevalence of malaria and the evening inundation of insects into our one man tents

3516436 im not going to speculate on who i think has my granddaughter
3516437 these people know they are being watched they know it
3516438 evidence out there is circumstantial being growing up in someones mind
3516439 they are narrow minded they dont have a lot of intelligence in their head if they want to be negative they want to have a one track mind thats on them not on me

3516447 when health care providers tell patients to watch their carbs eat more fiber or to avoid saturated fats most people dont know where to start
3516448 myfoodadvisor takes the guesswork out of that this tool appeals to so many looking for nutrition information people with diabetes because of the consistent portions of carbohydrates and proteins people with or at risk for heart disease because of the option to search by fiber sodium and saturated fats and people with kidney disease because potassium and phosphorous information is included which is not listed on standard nutrition labels
3516449 sometimes the low fat version of our favorite foods contains more sugar or sodium than the regular version or the sugar free contains more trans and saturated fat
3516450 it is a good idea to have the total picture before making a decision at the grocery store
3516451 lets say for example you are trying to watch the amount of carbohydrates you eat but also trying to increase your fiber intake
3516452 you can search for recipes that meet both of those needs
3516453 if one person in the family has type 2 diabetes or heart disease chances are there are others around the dinner table who could be at risk as well
3516454 myfoodadvisor can help to implement healthier food choices for the entire family

3516477 this russian military attack on independent georgia has a serious impact on the security and availability of oil and natural gas to our free allies in central and western europe let us recognize that a disruption of the btc oil pipeline could send our oil prices even higher and ultimately this violative attack by russia will increase long term oil prices due to its impact on an oil pipeline from kazakhstan that would not traverse through either russia or iran russia is a major natural gas producer as well and this attack can have a chilling impact on affordable natural gas from kazakhstan and turkmenistan lets commit as americans to the vital mission of american energy security
3516478 the russian bear is trying to choke the vital east west energy arteries in the caucasus specifically the btc oil pipeline and the gas pipeline
3516479 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement

3516490 i preferred herman dune with two brothers in the band
3516491 back when i was 4 and his cover of crass
3516492 you know what screw most talented and best future or budget i make with the funny at the water cooler all day so either you pay me the most money of any employee here or im going to work in europe
3516493 every indication ive received from those who supervised and managed him is when he was doing his job he did a good job regrettably however thats not good enough when alcohol interferes with your ability to perform your duties and certainly causes you to have accident in a city owned car
3516494 we representatives for religious minorities are active in the parliament and there has never been any mention of such a thing
3516495 i actually have several customers a day saying hey i saw your ad on tv as i was pumping gas
3516496 in this difficult time we have to make ends meet however possible
3516497 the customer is tied to the screen with an 8 foot rubber hose for five minutes
3516498 one of the pitfalls for convenience store owners these days is that people pay at the pump
3516499 people dont want to go inside the store anymore but at the gas pump youve got a captive audience
3516500 it doesnt bother me but im not really paying much attention to it
3516501 its still the healthiest beverage sector but its prime sun belt market overlaps closely to the areas where the housing bust has been the most severe so there is definitely concern
3516502 after filling up a lot of consumers dont have the heart to even enter the store
3516503 hes racing well and the way were activating him is really powerful
3516504 there were plenty of money shots where the guy drinks a monster after winning a medal
3516505 everyone tells me there are 1 000 energy drinks but there are only five that matter
3516506 its regular prices and daily special make for affordable shopping that wont break the bank
3516507 as im reporting from las vegas id better put my cards on the table at the outset and say im not tescos biggest fan and i say that as both someone who has written for convenience store magazine for many years and has seen how the grocery giant has trampled on the independents and as a consumer
3516508 that said i was quite excited to see tescos take on a stateside c store
3516509 i must say that i did like the store specifically the fresh food bits but i found the layout of other areas puzzling
3516510 in addition there was no clever merchandising to entice you to make any impulse purchases even though i visited at 11 30 a m on a friday a time when a typical uk c store would be full of people this fresh amp easy outlet was practically empty
3516511 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only those who do the will of my father who is in heaven
3516512 come in and join us to hear the good news
3516513 we cant be bothered going to you so you come to us
3516514 did you hear what so and so wants to do hes completely mad
3516515 its too embarrassing and besides who would want to be bothered standing around all day in the cold
3516516 were having people just go into driveways pulling in hooking up a car
3516517 when we check out the ones without the marking on the side theres a possibility well get a stolen car out of it
3516518 they just gave time and effort and put a great deal of beauty into this home
3516519 you can tell they took time and wanted it to be something special
3516520 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
3516521 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
3516522 i think it speaks to the economic climate that these teams are dealing with
3516523 what mightve made sense at 8 to 12 million becomes a difficult equation at 16 to 20 million because you arent necessarily selling more product just because the racing has gotten more expensive
3516524 we try to be very clear it is just promotional images that theyre receiving
3516525 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3516526 would not be in the best interest of the community

3516540 since the governors algebra i requirement takes effect in just three years we must make the investments in our school system now in order to meet this extremely tight timetable for public education
3516541 if you want to consider yourself well versed on the subject you need to make sure to read this person and this person and this person
3516542 im a writer and im paid to write about how something felt and this is how these events felt to me and it doesnt matter if what i say is exactly true or not not from a factual standpoint because they are factual accounts of how i felt at that moment or perhaps how i felt thirty years later when looking back on it through the filter of a mainstream publishing contract and looming deadline
3516543 sh t i pulled out of my ass that sounds all tragic and crap and that no one can exactly either prove or disprove
3516544 me pre natal what are these fleshy jail cell walls that hold me in so tightly probably the result of my mother of course the cocktail swilling fool i wish to yell at her wish to express my disgust at her smothering yet cold presence but then i realize oh yes thats right im a fetus im not yet capable of advanced thought or human speech so why is it that im already so eerily attracted to the six million dollar man
3516545 its hard even to be in here right now i mean i didnt want this to happen
3516546 they raised the water 40 percent we use water just to run the steam in our ovens let alone all the wash we had to do and the taxes are unbelievable and theyre going to go up again
3516547 big business will get taxes off little business they dont care about and thats what made the country
3516548 what theyve gone through as far as cost of doing business here and yet having the desires to succeed and one combating the other is exactly why we need to have some sort of reform
3516549 its too hard to live next to something that has been around for 35 years and still see the same customers pull up and just look across the street and see that its done its over
3516550 i dont even think up a bow knife again really i mean im really depressed about it
3516551 morning bungey hope you have a good day today see you later love you bye
3516552 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3516553 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
3516554 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
3516555 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3516556 with the full feature set sleek form factor and updated user interface the pnd k3 is a serious competitor in the step up portable navigation market
3516557 i have had the phone for a couple of weeks and i havent had any dropped calls until a couple of days ago now at least 50 of my call get dropped or i get a call failed message when trying to make a call even though i have a strong signal on 3g
3516558 the phone will also bounce from 3g to edge to no service and then back to 3g the phone works fine if i turn off 3g but that defeats the purpose of having a 3g iphone
3516559 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3516560 god will never give you more than you can handle
3516561 we would have expected that as people got older the difference between the two groups would start to narrow
3516562 yang peiyi missed out on selection to appear at the ceremony because of her external appearance it was for the national interest
3516563 why worry so much about appearances all seven year olds are angels
3516564 i see no violation with regards to him having contact with his sister
3516565 the study supports the use of 11c pib pet in the evaluation of beta amyloid deposition in for example mild cognitive impairment alzheimers disease or normal pressure hydrocephalus
3516566 large and prospective studies are required to verify whether 11c pib pet will become a tool in diagnosing alzheimers disease another potential use of 11c pib would be the quantitative monitoring of beta amyloid deposits in the brain in subjects under treatment in pharmaceutical trials of early alzheimers disease targeting amyloid accumulation
3516567 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3516568 i was moved every time we did a rehearsal of this from the bottom of my heart
3516569 please save the last bit of trueness in our children
3516570 they think yang peiyis smile is not cute enough what we need is truth not some fake loveliness
3516571 after the recording we thought lin miaokes voice was not very suitable
3516572 finally we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis
3516573 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3516574 we therefore recommend to the software updates from apple in the eye this you get through itunes
3516575 we advise customers to keep an eye on apples software updates
3516576 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3516577 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3516578 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3516579 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3516580 john mccain does have a long history of working with these issues an extraordinary familiarity with the key participants and a historical understanding of how this conflict and crisis has come to be
3516581 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3516582 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3516583 we have not achieved peace yet but we have achieved a provisional cease fire of hostilities
3516584 all we need to do now is to stop suffering stop the death of people
3516585 there are bigger problems relating to south ossetia that we cannot resolve here
3516586 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3516587 i think that these are some very good principles in order to resolve the problem which has arisen from this very dramatic situation and these principles can be used by georgia and south ossetia
3516588 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3516589 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3516590 almost all of the attacks are broadly and globally sourced one attack appears to be very narrowly focused possibly someone with some basic ping flood scripts
3516591 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3516592 we therefore recommend to the software updates from apple in the eye this you get through itunes
3516593 we advise customers to keep an eye on apples software updates
3516594 he was aspiring to be an actor out there he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name
3516595 there is nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use it to defraud
3516596 converting rainforests peatlands savannas or grasslands to produce food crop based biofuels in brazil southeast asia and the united states creates a
3516597 more deforestation results from a chain reaction so vast its subtle u s farmers are selling one fifth of their corn to ethanol production so u s soybean farmers are switching to corn so brazilian soybean farmers are expanding into cattle pastures so brazilian cattlemen are displaced to the amazon
3516598 i did not set out to offend anybody but sometimes when you are making an r rated comedy that happens
3516599 that is not what i set out to do but i think the movie is good and it speaks for itself
3516600 the jokes are all in context of what some actors are willing to do to win an oscar
3516601 that is a longstanding joke in hollywood that certain types of roles like the one joked about in the film help put you in the minds and eyes of the academy voters and to what lengths some actors will go to bring one of those gold bad boys home
3516602 t heres a part of me thats a little puzzled and disappointed like where were you when came out because that was pretty offensive
3516603 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3516604 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3516605 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3516606 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3516607 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3516608 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3516609 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3516610 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3516611 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3516612 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3516613 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3516614 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3516615 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3516616 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3516617 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3516618 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3516619 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3516620 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3516621 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3516622 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3516623 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3516624 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3516625 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3516626 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3516627 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago

3516632 what the hell this small piece of mirror doing on my shoe for
3516633 everyone is in a panic but trying not to show this we are afraid if one person shows it everyone will we are trying to calm down
3516634 we felt that we couldnt afford that people lose confidence in the banks
3516635 i remember the smell of gunfire the smell of war in the air it was very painful to see the loss of territory people falling into poverty
3516636 i tell them to be calm but stay vigilant and if the time comes leave
3516637 we know what it is like to be part of the soviet union and we are a people who love freedom
3516638 through words and deeds we have tremendously damaged relations with our neighbors we have made mistakes we have to act more prudently
3516639 dont bother that is not your home any more just go
3516640 we dont know what to do if i go back i dont have a house i dont have cows nothing
3516641 they all put the blame on russia a lot of people are not supporting the government but they are united in one idea that we have to fight for our freedom and independence
3516642 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3516643 is becoming a new focal point in the abortion debate
3516644 opponents say it would be one of the most rigid and inflexible bans in the country they worry about the impact it could have on roe vs wade
3516645 south dakotans rejected a stricter law banning abortions in their state
3516646 the illinois born alive infant protection act would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child
3516647 the whole experience has done everything to piss off their most loyal fan base
3516648 if you dont already miss it you dont need it
3516649 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3516650 were not going to meet that goal by 2010 unless we alter our course and make some significant changes
3516651 the programs we have in place arent enough to get us where we are going
3516652 and also investigate ways to bring it to the biz community the economic climate has business owners feeling the brunt of rising health care costs
3516653 over 10 000 vermonters have insurance who didnt have it when we started last october we think thats significant enrollment we think thats a significant inroad into the 60 000 uninsured vermonters
3516654 vpirg was in the room when those things were considered and i think they understand why the legislature didnt enact the recommendations in their report
3516655 we think there are myths out there keeping people from finding out whether they are eligible for the program
3516656 some of its natural some of its from unstable terrain or erosion but when we see flooding like this we see a lot of stuff in the rivers
3516657 if you are out in a river and you are exposed to e coli at that level then you are 8 in 1 000 likely to become ill with gastrointestinal type illness
3516658 the vermont standard is actually so low so as to not pose a risk to swimmers
3516659 it can be very hard to predict if it is safe today and not safe tomorrow but it will be safe the day after that

3516662 hemos aprobado en general los seis principios de alto el fuego y de arreglo del conflicto
3516663 people dont want to be spoken at they want direct relationships with the brands they believe in its a conversation and they hold the power to determine the fate of your brand making meaning is about doing what you say and saying what you do this presentation explores the idea of making meaning in the digital world its about the idea of always doing better
3516664 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first
3516665 our concentration has been good and the competition has been good
3516666 its funny being a head coach its never a good practice
3516667 because if the defense is good you worry about the offense if the offense is good you worry about the defense
3516668 it was spirited in there were getting better and we have to do it again tomorrow
3516669 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3516670 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3516671 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3516672 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3516673 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3516674 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3516675 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3516676 gooch and i got a lot of confidence out of that match
3516677 there are still areas of our game we can work on when we play together but its a work in progress i guess

3516691 this is your mask now your real face is the one criminals fear
3516692 if we plant this wheat ill have far more bread than ill ever need in my life who will help me plant it
3516693 ill give you the absolute bare minimum required by law
3516694 and youre lucky to get that with this job market
3516695 i spent it all on liberating iraq and tax cuts for the wealthy
3516696 and we dont have enough bread to feed our families
3516697 its your own fault for being so lazy and idle
3516698 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3516699 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3516700 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3516701 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3516702 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3516703 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3516704 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3516705 here you are dry yourself off mister rossi would not like to see his cars interior get too soaked even in this mess
3516706 yes i am rex yoder personal accountant to alfonso rossi you may be wondering about my apparent lack of italian lineage
3516707 no need to be bashful about it i know how other families operate as im sure you do mister
3516708 certainly marv as i was saying the rossis hire based on merit rather than family tree of course my great grandmother
3516709 look mister yoder from one anglo to another it doesnt mean a thing to me so long as the check is made out to the right person
3516710 it says here that you graduated magna cum laude from the and you have obtained a doctorate in child psychology so i suppose that means i should be calling you doctor marv
3516711 fair enough i also see that you spent some time in prison and were barred from practice for assault and battery involving a patient who was stalking you your official credentials are quite impressive if i do say so as a fellow post graduate but i assume you have your anger issues resolved
3516712 thank you for asking mr yoder but from what i gathered from rossi himself ive already been hired for the job and my run in with the law is not usually a liability with my regular employers so whats the deal with the interview shtick
3516713 seeing as how i am alfonso rossis main public liaison marv i feel it is very important that i become fully acquainted with his other hired associates
3516714 and to also take this opportunity to give one final evaluation of these associates before they begin work your job is a particularly sensitive one as im sure you know so this duty of mine is tantamount
3516715 listen here you needle dick little pansy seeing as how my job is particularly sensitive as you so put it then you should also know that i am no one to be fucked with there arent very many people in my particular line of work in fact given the length of my professional resume it might be pretty goddamn obvious to you that im the only guy who can do what i do and do it right rossi knows my reputation precedes me and so should you if you are worth even half what hes paying you
3516716 i suppose we wont need to be discussing your qualifications any further we are almost to the rossi estate we have prepared a nice supper for you
3516717 sir we are just about there you may want to be alert for this it is quite grand
3516718 i noticed that you have brought no more than that single small bag should you be requiring anything else during your stay marv i can arrange to have you taken into the city to do some shopping
3516719 i travel light i dont typically stay longer than a few days on any given job
3516720 a few days youre that confident and you havent even met the family
3516721 between you and me yoder there isnt much about this job that is different from one family to the next killers often breed killers
3516722 i like to keep it with me at all times
3516723 suit yourself but i need ta check it out anyway see if yous carrying anything suspicious
3516724 no problem but do know that the items in there that might look suspicious are part of the job which mr rossi is well aware of im hiding nothing
3516725 boys boys boys we were beginning to worry its raining like a cocksucker out here
3516726 connie thank you for doing the driving tonight go inside and get yourself settled the missus has cooked up a goddamn feast
3516727 its great to meet you in person al tony bianchi has said wonderful things about you and your family
3516728 well hes got a lot hanging on what he says and what he doesnt say about me if you know what i mean
3516729 my wife audrey shes a good woman fucking mouth on her though i keep telling her come in though please
3516730 al and i have been so excited to meet you mister
3516731 yes marv thats nice and simple huh anyway i told alfonso junior and isabelle all about you i should call them down for supper
3516732 i keep telling you about that big fuckin mouth of yours
3516733 yeah i guess thats one thing ill need to be working on huh
3516734 rex can you go upstairs and get the kids so audrey doesnt have to yell again im about to get a headache over here
3516735 so how you like rex good fuckin man isnt he
3516736 yeah he was a good find that yoder no he aint blood but hes about as close as it gets hes a strange cat i give ya that but hes more loyal than my own dog ordinarily id have him try to do what youre gonna be doing but youve got the right credentials hes real smart but he aint good with kids at all
3516737 well if you dont mind me saying marv from the looks of ya i wouldnt guess youd be much good with kids either
3516738 i guess you have a point there al appearances can be deceiving
3516739 i hope you dont mind that i told the kids you were going to be a nanny
3516740 thats fine mr rossi in a way i guess its what i am
3516741 it seems to me youre more like a fixer a kid fixer fuckin kids nowadays arent nothing like we used to be theyre different softer
3516742 a lot of people think that kids have overall gotten more aggressive
3516743 that wasnt till it got illegal to even correct your kids when they were wrong grab them by the scruffs of their necks and show them who the boss is audrey and all her little girlfriends who started popping out kids in the nineties changed the fuckin rules now theyre all babied spoiled pampered little shits like those two in there
3516744 dont get me wrong i love my kids marv but i aint fit to raise no pussies
3516745 al i highly doubt that your kids are going to turn out like pussies you have no problem keeping your employees in line i can almost guarantee you that your kids will eventually follow suit even without my help
3516746 thats the problem marv if i kept my kids in line the same way i kept my boys in line id be arrested for fuckin child abuse
3516747 theyd probably al capone me marv wouldnt that be ironic
3516748 well i wouldnt call that so much ironic as unfortunate
3516749 anyway i want to make absolutely sure that you want to go through with this before i do it al if you say yes were going all the way im tough and i dont put up with bullshit its really hard to undo my training if you like your kids the way they are now then you might want to think twice because when im through with them theyre going to be fine tuned bosses in waiting they will be tougher and more cunning they may even end up being better at the business than you do you think you could handle that
3516750 i only ask that you go easier on the girl if its okay by you its not her whos gonna be running this thing one day maybe im still a little old fashioned but girls are different
3516751 if you could actually make the boy more dangerous than me id make you a fuckin millionaire
3516752 i was wondering if we could have a little talk your parents and i want us all to get to know each other a little bit would that be cool with you
3516753 i guess or shes somewhere with my dad they usually are out visiting the horses in the evenings
3516754 nah not usually not that i want to go really horses arent really my thing
3516755 basically yeah i want to make my own some day
3516756 who are you anyway dad said you were a nanny you dont seem much like a nanny theyre usually chicks arent they
3516757 your mom and dad hired me to get to know you guys spend some time talk we may even play a few games if youre up for it
3516758 yeah i have that and some others you play games
3516759 do you mind al if i record what were talking about it makes it easier for me to remember things
3516760 you know who i go to school with right one kid aaron bianchi talked about a guy who came and stayed with them for awhile talked some talk and did a bunch of scary crap to him said the guy wouldnt let him eat until he used a taser on his sister he held out for a day and a half and ended up zapping the hell out of her also said he wasnt allowed to come back to the house until he ransacked the neighbors place for some piece of jewelry the old woman woke up and tried to take him down and he broke her jaw it was pretty fucked up shit
3516761 i think so yeah its all right though i know what my dad does for a living i know that one day hell need me to take over i may be a kid but im not a total idiot dude
3516762 no no alfonso i never suspected for a second you were an idiot
3516763 its my sister you might want to watch out for doc i know she seems all cute and innocent but shes a little weird
3516764 didnt you see all those stuffed animals she has crazy isnt it
3516765 you have about f f five minutes to get out of here before the c cops arrive i know why im even telling you th this is y your doing all your doing
3516766 just g go i dont know w what you said to her but i think it w worked too well

3516930 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3516931 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3516932 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3516933 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3516934 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3516935 the original vision at the heart of shared worlds has always been the desire to provide a place where oddball kids like me could get together and play with ideas
3516936 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3516937 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3516941 it was a travesty that we trailed at half time but i told the lads i was proud of their first half display and to be fair to them they kept at it in the second half
3516942 even the most ardent swindon fan will admit that we deserved to be in front at the break
3516943 i counted 12 clear cut opportunities we created and with a little bit more care and attention we would have been home and dry by the break
3516944 there were a lot of good performances out there and dani was exceptional
3516945 angelo was outstanding dani showed what hes all about mikele gave us everything and dexter worked tirelessly across the line his goal was textbook
3516946 i think swindon are a very good side and they will be a handful this year
3516947 i have to say though that we were outstanding in the first half and we fully deserved our victory
3516948 coxy pounced onto one and got another goal and we got back into it quickly it was another strikers goal but unfortunately we couldnt go on and secure the victory in the second half
3516949 macca did well again and he is a player thats for sure he drifts in and out a little bit but overall his performance was excellent
3516950 qpr went into the game as favourites but we gave it everything even at 3 2 down we looked like we could go and get a goal we certainly have a bit of bite about the side
3516951 a few of the squad need a game some of them are coming back from injury whilst some need match action
3516952 barry corr will play big patrick will get a game because it is important that we get everyone fit going into saturdays game at cheltenham
3516953 we will go away and see how we go the team that played tonight will have a day off tomorrow and then we will get back into training on thursday

3517015 when it came out in book form a month ago my friends mentioned the editing problems in it so a friend of mine with a masters in education went through it for me it had close to a thousand editing errors in a 182 page book so have some who actually knows what literary content should be in a book go through your book for you before you send the final draft back to publishamerica because the final draft is how the book will be when it comes out
3517016 i too am not the best editor lol i did get my finished books and when i met with a lady that is huge in the marketing field she told me that my book at its length of 132 pages needs to have chapters

3517024 meteen na de wedstrijd was ik wat ontgoocheld maar nadat ik alles wat liet bezinken besefte ik dat ik het fantastisch heb gedaan ik had me vooraf als doelstelling een top 10 plaats vooropgesteld maar als je na de dressuur op een tweede plaats staat dan begin je soms net iets teveel te dromen
3517025 ik reed de beste dressuur in mijn leven stond dan ook tweede in de tussenstand op de olympische spelen en zowel ik als de media zijn dan veel te veel verwachtingen gaan koesteren ik had vooraf zeker getekend voor een plaats in de top tien en dan is een negende plaats fantastisch deze eventingcompetitie was aan de top van de rangschikking van zeer hoog niveau
3517026 er werd veel beter gesprongen in de jumping dan gewoonlijk als ik twee keer foutloos was gebleven in de jumping had ik een medaille kunnen veroveren maar als ik realistisch ben was die kans klein en achteraf kan je allerlei veronderstellingen maken ik heb mezelf niets te verwijten ik heb n foutje gemaakt in de eerste jumpingproef maar dat is alles wat ik me kan verwijten ik ben blij dat het voorbij is dit is voor mij n van de mooiste kampioenschappen
3517027 ik heb weinig fouten gemaakt het is fantastisch geweest en dat gevoel zal ik overhouden aan de olympische spelen ik wil ook iedereen bedanken die zo hard voor me heeft gesupporterd ik kijk nu al uit naar de olympische spelen van londen 2012 waar ik opnieuw zal proberen een medaille te halen

3517081 if they want to study biblical greek at midnight or early in the morning or during their lunch breaks whatever fits into their schedule they can do so in this program
3517082 he is eminently qualified as a professor of greek besides his seminary training he has achieved two degrees in the classical languages a master of arts from washington university st louis and a doctor of philosophy from the university of wisconsin madison
3517083 greek lends itself well to new ways of teaching online
3517084 because were able to offer it over the course of three quarters we can also slow down the pace and make it easier for the student to keep up
3517085 our purpose at concordia theological seminary is to support the church by forming servants in jesus christ we hope that offering biblical greek online will make it possible for more people to identify and make use of their talents and gifts for serving in gods kingdom

3517088 some doctors may think oh my goodness what happened to the baby s butt
3517089 but the doctor understood that s just how asians are if the physician already knows about it if they are aware that certain races have certain characteristics then they don t have any doubts
3517090 unfortunately since dr dayan is now on a very important diplomatic assignment i had to exonerate myself from his allegations which the international community would have believed as coming from the ambassador representing sri lanka it could also be interpreted as government views his unwanted comments had considerably damaged my reputation as a moderate senior tamil politician of some standing dr dayan jayatilleka should have diplomatically avoided getting involved in defence of hon douglas devananda

3517093 despite the well documented difficulties and differences of epstein and lucchino lucchino is said by people familiar with the just departed ramirez soap opera to have been much more committed to keeping ramirez no matter how badly the man child superstar behaved and how much he risked undermining the clubhouse the two innovative yalies have engineered this red sox renaissance and combined to bring two world series titles to the previously star crossed and storied organization

3517101 one bottle hurled by one person in a crowd of hundreds and a country of a billion plus does not represent the majority opinion
3517102 when we looked at asias macroeconomy early this year we were slightly surprised that there was barely any slowdown compared to the first quarter of 2007
3517103 thats partly attributable to the fact that in the first quarter the us economy had not slowed down as much as expected
3517104 and growing regional integration is helping offset the impact of a us slowdown
3517105 they would have normally cut interest rates to offset a global slowdown but as inflation picked up the ability of central banks to offset global demand slowdown has been hampered
3517106 there will definitely be a change in our revenue mix which will see a significant difference by 2009 10 however putting a number to it would be difficult
3517107 but i dont think it is likely at this time due to the economic conditions i guess its best i continue with this company for now and move only when the situation improves

3517113 we can go by what people say and their body language president hu jintao and premier wen jiabao at every meeting they have had with the pm when the issue was raised have indicated that they will not be a problem that happens when they meet and even in telephone conversations pakistan did its damnedest to block the iaea but china took a very correct position
3517114 most of them recognise that the major constraint in our nations progress is absence of clean energy and energy at affordable prices thats the line we have projected and it has gone down well with 95 of the countries we have a small number worried about non proliferation if we can get over that we are over the hill
3517115 all the actions attributed to the speaker enjoy immunity but how can other employees enjoy immunity
3517116 secretary has no privilege it is only the legislators who enjoy the immunity
3517117 it appears that some of the legislators wanted to protect rightly or wrongly the officials served with notice by the ombudsman
3517118 was a brazen attempt to protect some officials and his action was a serious issue

3517128 the automotive industry is now focusing on its environmental obligations to reduce co2 emissions and improve efficiencies and we are seeing the high technology capabilities of lotus engineering being in strong demand not only does our brand value of performance through light weight fit perfectly with the necessary direction of the industry to produce lighter more efficient vehicles we are also working on all aspects of future fuels investigating alternative powertrains to accommodate alcohol fuels as they enter the market
3517129 alcohols possess superior combustion characteristics to gasoline which allow greater optimisation taking full advantage of the benefits of sustainable bio alcohols will ensure a greater percentage of vehicle miles will be travelled using renewable fuels we are delighted with the investment from defra which will assist this partnership in taking forward research development and the demonstration of this environmentally conscious transport solution
3517130 the requirement to operate on gasoline in todays flex fuel engines limits their thermal efficiency when operating on alcohol fuels however the physical and chemical properties of alcohols when compared to gasoline provide the potential for higher thermal efficiency operation to be achieved this single cylinder research engine will investigate a highly thermal efficient combustion system that optimises engine performance to fully exploit the properties of both gasoline and alcohol fuels and maximise efficiency
3517131 is a little road music to accompany us as we make the timeless journey between earth and sky

3517143 the five or six largest oems will decide what they want to buy in the marketplace and thats what the industry will follow
3517144 we can learn from what the disk drive folks went through back in the early 80s there were dozens of hard drive makers all scrambling to see who would win out now there are only six major ones left theyre still making and selling lots of drives but the main difference now is that shipments are much larger the customers made their choice then and the same thing will happen in flash
3517145 about when am i not going to lose my job for using flash ssds in my servers
3517146 personally i think ssds are a terrible replacement for hhds at this time for a lot of reasons the biggest of which is that they havent been around long enough to know how they really will perform in heavy duty production situations
3517147 few years and that if they were one half or one quarter the cost they are now there would be a lot more adoption by this point
3517148 right now there are about 60 flash vendors and about 17 organizations doing some kind of standards work
3517149 we were sitting down trying to count up the number of standards organizations that are affiliated with flash in some way
3517150 we came up with 17 that we know of there are probably more the tier 1 oems and thats only five or six guys companies are going to define what is successful in the market
3517151 what their strategies are around ssds sun has some other vendors have but the full playing field hasnt been shown yet
3517152 look in the boot look in the boot my husband is there look in the boot
3517153 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3517154 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3517155 the talks have not collapsed its just a time out break
3517156 the risk of relapse was still small but certainly not insignificant
3517157 i think these numbers are somewhat reassuring but they also highlight the need for new therapeutic options for women who have completed five years of treatment

3517167 we are now seeing new attacks against ge sites ge is the top level domain for georgia ed www parliament ge and president gov ge are currently being hit with http floods
3517168 are well known to be under the control of rbn and influenced by the russian government
3517169 the governor absolutely must deliver the resources needed to make this mandate succeed
3517170 im glad to see the state superintendent is embracing the goal of teaching algebra to all california eighth graders and moving forward to improve
3517171 the environmental benefits are many fold i mean the fact is were driving lead out of a lead acid battery so theres lead reduction already that makes this a green technology
3517172 but then secondly because it will last and run longer it enables a lot of things to be done that are greener like not having to turn on your engine and emit noise and air pollution
3517173 i do not think the u s should intervene militarily in this situation at all im really troubled because ive been to georgia and met with their leaders im troubled with the russian invasion i think it was totally unwarranted
3517174 i dont think our military should be involved look they have to settle this dispute but i do think the u n and nato need to put a heck of a lot of pressure on the russian government to call off the troops

3517192 el festival de locarno se ha inaugurado este a o con brideshead revisited pero no es con el libro con lo que esta pel cula ser comparada sino con la serie de televisi n hom nima de 1981 de granada television que marc un hito en la historia del medio el formato de once episodios de la serie le da al relato una cadencia particular con la sensaci n del paso del tiempo destructor de lo que se hunde y lo que permanece del nuevo mundo que se alumbra en el periodo de entreguerras en el formato de cine todo sucede de manera m s vectorial m s transparente como si no hubiera espacio para el tiempo perdido

3517215 we know that the address is the common link to many government databases
3517216 so it only makes sense that maintenance is the key to upholding the quality and accuracy of evolving datasets for many agencies thats easier said than done
3517217 many clients tell us they and their adjacent agencies have spent so much manpower collecting and recollecting data but still were unable to achieve the comprehensive and user friendly dataset ddti provided in a fraction of the time
3517218 we have always offered some form of maintenance support but the impact of this comprehensive data maintenance solution is much more immediate and far reaching
3517219 if minutes and sometimes seconds make the difference for 9 1 1 these agencies cant wait to receive updated data
3517220 we have mapped a lot of counties and worked with a lot of psaps so we know their first priority is having the accurate data to get their responders to a distress call this solution gives them that accuracy in a timely manner and does not disrupt the normal daily workflow environment

3517223 the investment bank continues to be negatively affected by the disruption in the credit and mortgage markets as well as by overall lower levels of liquidity and wider credit spreads
3517224 the continuation of these factors could potentially lead to reduced levels of client activity lower investment banking fees and lower trading revenue
3517225 our programs aimed at generating strong organic growth are proving effective and we look for further increases in revenues going forward
3517226 we are confident our commitment to providing the highest levels of care and service will result in continued strong occupancies and increasing average rents over the long term while the introduction of innovative new services in our communities will also contribute to our growth
3517227 while the majority of our growth platforms are generating solid performance we are closely monitoring the u s market as economic and other challenges appear to now be impacting our performance however over the longer term we expect we will continue to capitalize on our increased size and scale while prudently reducing our costs and benefiting from the strong demographic trends in all of our markets
3517228 looking ahead we are optimistic that our innovative marketing strategies and cost control initiatives will result in improved performance in our u s portfolio as the market conditions stabilize as well our u s management team has sourced new development and property management contracts and continues to explore further opportunities to augment future earnings in our u s management operations
3517229 in quebec the vast majority of our suite renovation and repositioning projects are now complete more competitive and in lease up we anticipate we will see improved overall occupancy in the quebec portfolio beginning this quarter with the complete recovery expected over the course of 2009
3517230 finally we believe that when the reorganization process at spectrum is complete chartwell will resume its development activities at a moderate pace in addition five spectrum projects have now achieved stabilization with another five nearing this milestone and we are evaluating the purchase of these state of the art properties to enhance our growth and the quality and average age of our portfolio
3517231 the management and board of cib marine continue to execute on the capital plan in an effort to provide the greatest value possible to the shareholders during these difficult times for cib marine and the financial service industry in general

3517233 an updated mineral resource estimate for the maracas vanadium project municipality of maracas bahia state brazil
3517234 we are delighted with the results of the feasibility study by aker solutions i believe it sets apart maracas as a robust vanadium deposit with the metrics from the feasibility study singling out the project as having the potential to become one of the worlds lowest cost primary producers of vanadium key milestones that will be pursued in the weeks ahead include formal commencement of basic and detailed engineering placement of orders for long lead items continued build up of largos team to be based in maracas completion of key elements of the licensing process and the finalization of the project financing the potential for expansion of the project is also very exciting
3517235 i also really like the variable messages that the signs offer and the excellent data collection software

3517255 i am not going to condone her silence for a second
3517256 silence is accepting what is going on and i for one do not accept that
3517257 all these questions need to be championed by our environment minister they need to be brought to the forefront by our environment minister
3517258 at that time i encouraged the minister to engage with first nations to hear their concerns first hand and i encouraged the minister to engage with the yukon river panel to ensure the yukon pacific salmon treaty was being adhered to
3517259 i know what they can handle and i know that they are ready for the league
3517260 i think they are going to do really well this year they are going to do well enough that i think next year they will have a few opportunities to move up not only just one
3517261 we were kind of disappointed when we finished the way we did but overall were happy with the season and happy with the way things went
3517262 its not the typical midget hockey you see across canada
3517263 the whitehorse mustangs have to play against adults in the recreational league and for a lot of them to be playing so well they are obviously dedicated to the sport and they work hard at getting better
3517264 a few of my buddies are going down there to so it would be fun
3517265 in junior thats the main aspect of it you need to be really quick or else you cant keep up
3517266 they made it into the playoffs last year i am hoping to go farther than they did though
3517267 we dont have another player like that and i think he is going to be a fan favourite actually
3517268 a lot of people are going to enjoy watching him play and he puts up a lot of points and the guy never stops smiling when he is out there so he is having a lot of fun
3517269 its a few steps up from whitehorse aa hockey and its one step down from junior a where a lot of these players want to be playing
3517270 its not easy coming from aa hockey in whitehorse to making junior a because its quite a step up the game happens at a quicker pace so they spend a year at that level and then they are ready to move on
3517271 i want to make sure we help the players achieve their individual goals
3517272 i know they all want to move on in hockey and i want to help them do that by helping them move up to junior a next year
3517273 i had thought it would be good to have a paper on magic and witchcraft in my programme and when one of my colleagues suggested the topic we decided to make it a collaborative effort
3517274 one of the options for the first assignment called on them to create a magical curse tablet or erotic charm and so far ive received everything from
3517275 the format of a curse or spell must be based on real examples from the classical period and reflect the beliefs of the practitioners
3517276 we are putting it in a historical context i also teach about christianity but im not advocating it
3517277 some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next
3517278 we are pleased to report record sales and gross profit for the quarter this is encouraging especially as economic factors such as decreased miles driven and escalating raw material and energy costs continue to challenge our company we have been successful in offsetting these variables by savings achieved through our restructuring efforts and a continued focus on operational expense reductions
3517279 we continue to expand our global capabilities as we pursue our objective of becoming a world class manufacturer and distributor of on and off highway replacement products and services our recent announcements regarding our plan to acquire 85 percent of longkou haimeng machining company limited in china the establishment of a greenfield brake manufacturing and distribution facility in mexico along with previously announced greenfield operations in ukraine and india clearly reinforce and support our globalization and transformation strategy the addition of these operations will provide us with world class manufacturing capabilities while enhancing our market access for growth around the world
3517280 the funds portfolio performed in line with expectations which reflects the diversity stability and quality of our power and social infrastructure assets
3517281 the fund continued to benefit from increased power production and higher power rates as well as predictable results from leisureworld moreover the funds financial position remains strong which will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities that contribute to the long term value of the portfolio
3517282 demand for the services provided by essential infrastructure assets is inelastic which means they deliver predictable performance throughout the economic cycle this stability is what makes infrastructure so compelling to investors seeking to diversify their portfolios
3517283 the funds outlook for the balance of fiscal 2008 is positive in addition we have substantial financial capacity for growth and are actively reviewing a range of opportunities our goal is to build a significant diversified portfolio of infrastructure assets that returns exceptional long term value to unitholders

3517440 whether one subscribes to the hippocratic dictum first do no harm or takes a cost benefit approach to treatment it is impossible to ignore the fact that antidepressants are not medically benign treatments
3517441 some investigators have argued that the relatively high relapse rate after drug treatment indicates that depression should be treated like a chronic medical disease requiring ongoing long term medical treatment indefinitely this logic appears tautological drug treatment results in a higher relapse rate than cognitive behavioral therapy therefore the patients should be maintained on drugs to prevent relapse
3517442 this was an unexpected finding because it was assumed that combining exercise with medication would have if anything an additive effect

3517453 farmers pay a fee for every bushel of soybeans they sell and a portion of every dollar spent on twinkies tv dinners and the thousands of other processed foods that contain soy in one form or another ultimately go towards the promotion of the most highly processed foods of all imitation meat milk cream cheese yogurt ice cream candy bars and smoothies made from soy

3517460 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3517463 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3517464 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3517465 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3517466 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3517467 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3517468 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3517469 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3517493 there has never been a problem with the fire engineers holding a meeting until tonight when a few people were supposed to show up
3517494 the report from the fire marshal has not been completed
3517495 my concern is that there is a problem with that fire department
3517496 i was first on the scene and able to watch if it had it not been for the departments from pease portsmouth and greenland that entire complex would have gone up in flames they sent people who did not know what to do and people that panicked when they got there they never set up a commend center and couldnt get the truck to run so instead of a 2 500 property damage claim the house burned down
3517497 everyone knows what happened of course but i want to push it far enough so it never happens again
3517498 people came with over 40 years of experience between them i dont want them to come to my house and if the chief is in charge of training i dont want him as the chief
3517499 every year they ask for more equipment more men and when they get to the first fire in 10 years they cant put it out
3517500 its a little party house down there and no one does anything about it what if that fire had happened four hours later and people were sleeping there would have been a fatality
3517501 we expect to review them in september and have someone onboard in october
3517502 the friendship represents early maritime trade of new england and the united states
3517503 her role is to educate the public about early maritime trade and one of the ways she does that is to sail to other ports and with our onboard rangers tell the story

3517525 successful development of open source software for health care will require viable developer communities such communities which share an interest in a particular type of software are the engines that drive open source projects
3517526 our experience taught us that these exchanges can improve quality and access to vital clinical information when and where it is needed with the potential for cost reduction we hope that more clinics and practices in underserved communities take advantage of open source products
3517527 apparently theyve engineered materials that can bend light around objects how fab you could wear an invisibili t shirt and spy on society swank fests
3517528 i mastered invisibility ages ago in fact i recently swanned around a cocktail party unnoticed for hours
3517529 were you wearing a light bending blazer a black hole burnoose
3517530 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3517531 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3517532 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3517533 we are now waiting for him to wake up and speak so we can find out more details about what happened
3517534 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3517535 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3517536 he has served alaska for 40 years but exclusive to provoke war cheney considered proposal to dress up navy seals as iranians and shoot at them mccain aide scheunemann linked to bush library cash for access scandal mayer top doj lawyers spoke in codes for fear of being wiretapped by white house lunatics mayer top doj lawyers spoke in codes for fear of being wiretapped by white house lunatics clueless gingrich claims inflating car tires properly to save energy is loony tunes mccain aide scheunemann linked to bush library cash for access scandal exclusive to provoke war cheney considered proposal to dress up navy seals as iranians and shoot at them mccain spokesperson lies katrina and rita didnt spill a drop of oil
3517537 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3517538 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3517539 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible
3517540 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3517541 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3517542 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3517543 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3517544 hes earned this hes had a long path to the big leagues and nothings been handed to him we were kind of looking for a way to get him up here and with wake on the d l it seemed like the perfect time well see how he throws but im sure this wont be his last start for the red sox
3517545 we dont need to have an artificial timetable when hes able to pitch with healthy thats when well pitch him
3517546 there are going to be days we may have to rest him and there are going to be days when he feels better than others

3517548 the internet community has become very polarized either you liked this book or you hated this book we took a stance that if you liked the book were going to be a place for discussion about that
3517549 we know that it was a disgruntled fan of the series who hacked our system it took place as a direct result of the lexicons backing of stephenie meyer and her work
3517550 if you were posting on every thread on our forums stephenie meyer is a terrible writer everything about it is horrible then we just arent the place for you
3517551 as her official fan site this needs to be a positive place where we can gather together and discuss what we like and have positive conversation hate spam makes it very difficult for someone to enjoy the site
3517552 if you hit the site with enough traffic its security measures begin to fall the message board had been spammed and it allowed a hole in the security net that somebody was able to get through and delete forums
3517553 because of the spamming there were so many ip addresses there is no shortage of suspects and no way to know which one exactly did the attack
3517554 the hole that enabled them to get into the blog has been sealed as far as contacting law enforcement we have been in contact with our server company and there are definite measures being taken to ensure that this doesnt happen again
3517555 its a very difficult time for the fandom in that you liked it or you really hated it everyone feels like they need to get their say but that means that the fans that really liked it need to have their site too the blog is that place for these ladies and a few men who have been worshipping this book for years
3517556 for those who were disappointed go be passionate about something else
3517557 lots and lots of black smoke its going to take a long long time to put out because its not got good access and the water pressure is not brilliant there
3517558 i cant support fuelwatch in the way its been put up by the government

3517572 mientras que mil millones de personas pobres luchan para sobrevivir al crecimiento global e implacable de los precios de los productos alimentarios y de los carburantes
3517573 es importante lanzar nuevas respuestas para atajar esta crisis alimentaria tan extendida
3517574 proporcionar raciones de comida a poblaciones muy vulnerables a seguir alimentando a ni os durante las vacaciones escolares y a aportar complementos nutritivos a las mujeres embarazadas y a los ni os con amenazas en su desarrollo f sico y mental
3517575 ampliar la asistencia alimentaria en las zonas urbanas particularmente afectadas por el aumento de los precios entregando dinero en efectivo o bonos alimentarios

3517578 from deep inside my heart i want to return immediately to my own country with my grandchild
3517579 cheap mothers are available here there is so much poverty its employment for them
3517580 you have treated the surrogate mother like an object used her as a factory produced something given money for it
3517581 it is absolutely traumatic especially for the grandmother because they have a visa for a limited period of time
3517582 what happens if the period expires how do they manage the problem where do they leave the baby where does the baby stay who cares for the baby
3517583 i think obviously india owes an obligation to speed up the legal and judicial process so that the child is able to travel as soon as possible
3517584 i am very worried and stressed why cant they let her father take his child
3517585 i think this should end there should be stricter laws
3517586 half of the citizenship cases that they do now in mumbai are from surrogates
3517587 i will not leave india without her no matter what
3517588 geographic reach has become a more important thing for us
3517589 i was certainly encouraged to hear the speaker last night suggest a willingness to allow the house to have an up or down vote on the merits of unlocking the potential of americas abundant energy resources
3517590 renewable forms of energy including solar wind and tidal must be mainstreamed in order that they can substantially displace oil gas and coal many renewable forms are already being used in niche applications such as street signalling remote area power supply and village homes
3517591 a great deal of r amp d is required to bring solar energy costs down a strong government commitment to r amp d matched by an increasing scale of technology will help kickstart this change
3517592 when one energy source decreases then an alternate power takes over the grid when there is no wind power we switch over to gas or thermal when different streams feed into the grid we cannot distinguish between power coal oil or hydro
3517593 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3517594 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3517595 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3517596 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3517597 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3517598 thin film is really the leading edge for satisfying demand from the utility market
3517599 utilities are sophisticated buyers all they care about is the lowest cost
3517600 the whole market can see a lot of really impressive growth in the long run but thats not to say thin film will displace everything else
3517601 there are high hopes of them launching a business model with electric utilities
3517602 the utility market is a market that could be the gold mine for the solar industry but we dont know how the subsidies are going to play out
3517603 there are a number of key questions that nobody has an answer for
3517604 if the subsidy is given to utilities then all they need is first solar to come in and sell modules or systems
3517605 in that process utilities could potentially put more pressure on first solar to lower prices
3517606 adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it

3517612 this is how sieg heil got started and no im not saying obama is hitler i just think people should be careful about slipping into a personality cult for a charismatic leader then he decided to slip back into delusion i would call that a raving success
3517613 the ceo role at cisco going back over the last five to 10 years has been very much command and control and i think we do it pretty well and if we say turn right 65 000 people turn right
3517614 thats very effective when youre in a couple product areas or one or two major cross functional initiatives per year it is not an effective leadership style or organization structure if youre moving into a lot of market adjacencies and you have a lot of major cross functional priorities
3517615 if someone is naturally charismatic what should they do not sure it is possible for one to turn off charisma if one is charismatic
3517616 expectation building because of charisma is like judging people by face value to a certain extent
3517617 also at a certain level charisma becomes involuntary doesnt it
3517618 a very charismatic leader can make people lose their moral ethical amp logical compasses
3517619 your spectacular victory has brought hope and cheer to the vast majority of people in this nation who now believe that all is not lost and that india can still be saved from the clutches of unscrupulous power mongers
3517620 all is not lost and that india can still be saved from the clutches of unscrupulous power mongers
3517621 i cannot think of any other leader in indian politics in the past 60 years who was as viciously and consistently maligned as modi since 2002

3517631 since the passage of the housing bill we have been contacted by families industry groups and individuals voicing concern about the long term impact of this ban on themselves and their communities

3517651 apparently the suspect mr moore was aggravated with him for driving the motorcycle and being too loud with it
3517652 it had sprayed the side of the vehicle and struck the victim on the side of the face and the arms
3517653 swat team surrounded his house and he was then ordered out of his house and he did comply and come out without incident
3517654 i believe when he saw the victim over there last night it just prompted him to shoot him i guess

3517674 es posible que ingresos extra y contabilidad creativa terminen mejorando esa cifra
3517675 sin embargo esta medida no resuelve el problema de fondo por el cual fue justificada por el ministro julio de vido el imparable incremento que viene mostrando la cuenta de subsidios estatales a la demanda el ctrica la raz n es que el grueso de los subsidios se canaliza a trav s de la generaci n que por ahora qued al margen de este ajuste tarifario en este segmento se sigue aplicando una f rmula explosiva importar gas y combustibles l quidos cada vez m s caros para que las generadoras produzcan y vendan energ a barata

3517685 the noble minded hawaiian chiefess who endowed the kamehameha schools put no limitations of race or condition upon her general bequest
3517686 there is nothing in the will of mrs bishop excluding white boys or girls from the schools
3517687 would not be in the best interest of the community
3517688 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3517689 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3517690 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3517691 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3517692 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3517693 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3517694 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems

3517707 we are always on the lookout for new ways to introduce the growing number of casual and female gamers to different gaming genres and systems that they might have otherwise passed by
3517708 the release of madden nfl 09 all play for the nintendo wii provides an ideal opportunity for gamestop to offer the increasing number of female gamers with a site of their own it also gives women the opportunity to make madden nfl 09 an exciting and engaging new alternative to the typical girls night out by providing the necessary tools to get in the game

3517711 when the house is on fire its better to have a psychotic fireman than no fireman at all
3517712 more time to reflect on the deplorable nature of his transgressions and come to terms with reality
3517713 he appears to be blaming all and sundry for his unhappy predicament the truth of the matter is that he is the sole conscious author of his present misfortune
3517714 not on account of the extended wild goose chase thong has taken all of us on but rather for the manifest inadequacy of the earlier sentences
3517715 violated the trust reposed in him as a senior public officer
3517716 aseans great success has been its ability to avoid conflict and allow economic development to progress unimpeded by intra regional security concerns
3517717 if you can bring together an organisation which has about it the habit of cooperation and peaceful dispute resolution as asean has involving countries as diverse as the republic of singapore and the socialist republic of vietnam then i think weve made some real progress
3517718 lets be clear what an asia pacific community is not it is not an economic union it is not a monetary union it is not even a customs union
3517719 my fear overall is if we dont inculcate these habits of cooperation and dialogue across the wider region involving all the great powers of the region there is always a risk of strategic drift in the reverse direction i dont want to see that happen
3517720 we are now dealing with the serious issue of managing our economy we are running this job seriously of course there are people who couldnt care so much anwar ibrahim is one particular person
3517721 that is his business while that is so our immediate interest is to protect the safety of our people
3517722 it does not really reflect on one or two persons leadership im not going to say something to please people when things are not well you say it so that people recognise what needs to be done
3517723 every morning when i read the newspapers i see a man saying hes going to take over the government things coming out of malaysia are not that good at the moment and the present government may not be in power in september
3517724 the spinning of these stories is dangerous he keeps moving the date from august to september
3517725 i am worried because i hope i can save some allowance
3517726 we might see students suffering in silence even to the extent of skipping meals to save money
3517727 now i can save up and help mum if she is short of money
3517728 after the semifinals the south korean womens archery team shot all arrows into the central gold target area we must bow our heads to their divine skills it wrote
3517729 when three men are walking together there is one who can be my teacher
3517730 the chinese womens archery team learned a great lesson from the south korean team in the finals
3517731 through wind rain and noisy spectators yun ok hee joo hyun jung and park sung hyun delivered south korea s sixth straight gold in the event the streak is only that short because this is only the sixth time the women s team competition has been held
3517732 he kept asian peoples pride alive in the mens freestyle swimming division that had been monopolized by western athletes he opened a new epoch and made us confident that asians can do it too
3517733 i knew he was going to finish strong over the last 50 meters and i wanted to have a big lead to hold him off
3517734 its not that i dont like to do business with singaporeans but its very tiring to move in and out
3517735 they were asking the government to fund the project worth some rm10 billion
3517736 i think malaysias judicial system is as efficient and fair as any other judicial systems including singapore
3517737 if i can help you you can come to me with more details but i will not be interfering in the process of law
3517738 the whole roof of the factory and the cables disappeared
3517739 officers are citizens too and they want to do the best for the country
3517740 more enforcement actions by the ccs even as it continues to educate the industry though more outreach programmes
3517741 thinking they can get at least one bite at the cherry in terms of anti competitive behaviour before they are slapped with meaningful sanctions
3517742 coralan appears equally effective and it has less side effects than beta blockers for example if a patient has asthma beta blockers will exacerbate asthma and this is where coralan may be used
3517743 make the country comfortable with the most unusual profile of any person ever to come within spitting distance of occupying the white house
3517744 driven by sen obamas schedule good thing with democratic sen barack obama on vacation
3517745 i dont know if the president quote missed the boat mccain replied
3517746 but i do believe that the president probably had a higher opinion of vladimir putin than i do
3517747 is clearly in keeping with the russian ambitions for the old near abroad control of or absolute takeover of surrounding countries and this may be trying to send a message to ukraine and other countries in the region
3517748 i dont think that theres going to be a re ignition of the cold war dont get me wrong i dont think theres going to be nuclear weapons build ups et cetera but i think that russian behavior is not acceptable and we will do what we can to maintain our alliances and our friends and make the russians understand that this kind of behavior is not a part of what we view as the 21st century
3517749 i respect sen obamas views and i believe that its important that we act in a bipartisan fashion now theres no room for partisanship now
3517750 the significant decline in the number of buprenorphine abusers in the first half of 2008 clearly shows that cnbs enforcement measures against buprenorphine abuse have been effective
3517751 alienating the power users is a sure way to drive them to other services and their audiences with them
3517752 the declining interest is partly from the perception that scientists dont get rich like lawyers and dentists and stockbrokers
3517753 you forgot the most important thing overhauling the patent system
3517754 but also because science isnt valued in a country full of creationists
3517755 one use your immense buying power to improve the security of commercial products and services one property of technological products is that most of the cost is in the development of the product rather than the production
3517756 gravity explains the motions of the planets but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion god governs all things and knows all that is or can be done
3517757 unfortunately its going to take a catastrophic blow to our critical it infrastructure before someone starts listening
3517758 i dont mean to troll but i see a major hole in your viewpoint that is the idea that personal private information or data has any value
3517759 im still living in hope that one day youll provide a proper analysis of the economic impacts of legislating about software liability on the consumers
3517760 we could argue all day long about whether creationism is pseudo science or not but it might help if we actually used scientific techniques to bash or defend it
3517761 we actually used scientific techniques to bash or defend it
3517762 personally im beginning to think there is no way you can have a secure computing platform which is actually capable of doing anything meaningfull
3517763 i am taking your time and using my time to write a simple letter because i feel it necessary
3517764 i care about people and will work as hard and long as necessary to overcome any obstacles or problems that would get in the way of obtaining the best policy at the best rate
3517765 what we have here is bureaucrats and government contractors coming in and trying to second guess what doctors and nurses have done in a hospital setting
3517766 a little zealotry is what were looking for on the part of the taxpayers we think its about time
3517767 actuaries are urging policy makers to raise the retirement age as the first step to shoring up social security and keeping younger workers from bearing the brunt of painful tax increases
3517768 we think that if you dig in and make these changes now it gives people time to plan
3517769 it gives people time to anticipate that now im age 35 im looking at an age 68 or 69 retirement for social security and that gives you a lot of years to plan for it
3517770 isnt going to solve the whole problem and likely would be part of a package of solutions
3517771 for the pre medicare crowd one serious illness or injury could wipe out their savings and drive them into bankruptcy
3517772 it was all a dream i used to read word up magazine

3517774 equality between women and men at work tensions and contradictions of the french implementation of equal opportunity policies this communication will attempt to show how this sex gender system is still a strong pilar of the structuration of the current french labour and employment market and that the political and legal responses made to tackle the question of profesionnal inequalities is equivocate regarding the assumptions on which they are based as well as the implementation that is being made of the different tools created
3517775 instead of returning those paintings he decided to keep them he wanted to cash in on them
3517776 he took the view that a finders fee was the usual and standard practice
3517777 i loved those paintings for all those years and they were gone
3517778 theres not a sentence in this world long enough for jon phillips

3517865 the court is mindful of the expense involved in a trial of this magnitude as well as the uncomfortable position of the judge in such a bench trial

3517930 falling inflation suggests that the governments macro tightening measures have been effective which will both reduce investor fears of the possibility of policy missteps and increase the chances of a shift to targeted pro growth policies

3517942 does not begin or end at the polling booth we are even told how to form our consciences beginning with a willingness and openness to seek the truth and what is right through the study of sacred scripture and the catechism of the catholic church and continuing with an examination of the background related to the choices before us we are told that forming our conscience also requires prayerful reflection to discern the will of god section 18
3517943 and yet nowhere in the article is the need to form ones conscience ever addressed instead readers are led to believe that they should vote on the basis of what they think or feel there is no reference to this active process catholics are instructed to perform the very essence of what it means to be a faithful citizen is omitted
3517944 is the compilation of general principles applied to the obligation that catholics have to exercise political responsibility in the light of their faith regardless of whether it is an election year and irrespective of the candidates who are running and the issues on which they are basing their campaigns
3517945 the times handling of the very delicate and complex challenge of voting also failed to represent the full scope of the bishops instructions the statement goes into great detail to emphasize that not all issues carry the same moral weight and that opposing intrinsically evil acts has a special claim on our consciences and our actions section 37 the document further cautions against the moral equivalence that makes no ethical distinctions between different kinds of issues involving human life and dignity the direct and intentional destruction of innocent human life from the moment of conception until natural death is always wrong and is not just one issue among many it must always be opposed section 28

3517964 claims its harder for models to land lucrative deals with fashion make up and fragrance firms while the big companies turn to beauties like jennifer aniston eva mendes and beyonce knowles to promote their products

3517978 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protaganists
3517979 its still way too early to speculate and write them off
3517980 the winds here have been light about four to six knots and many not just us are experiencing inconsistent results so we are expecting this regatta to be a high scoring one
3517981 some time back theyd gone to laguna hawker centre to buy mee pok hokkien for flat noodles and named their previous boat mee pok
3517982 others have gone down the same route too australian 470 sailor matthew belcher named his boats sexy taxi and sexy car
3517983 some say its bad luck not to name your boat or change its name but to us its more of a fun thing
3517984 we named it rpm after our names but also because it sounded fast like revolutions per minute we wanted the boat to go fast and thats what were hoping liying and deborah will do in qingdao
3517985 in the event such a decision were made made by the un or another international organisation estonia could be ready to offer our input
3517986 estonia has said many times that the principles of the peacekeeping operation in south ossetia and abkhazia should be changed given that russia has became one of sides in the conflict we can no longer talk of peacekeeping by russian forces in ordinary terms
3517987 one solution could be to form peacekeeping forces in those georgian regions where they are needed from states that have not been involved in the conflict

3517990 we were clear that we wanted to target the corporate business so no names that were too funky
3517991 a lot of people do not understand how much a logo is worth especially small businesses they make sure operations are in place try to turn a profit and then later struggle with growth
3517992 these young people do things that are unexpected and dont think along a linear path
3517993 the point is that they start small and they can suddenly change the way businesses operate
3517994 our society has always been very conservative but this is the kind of thing that can help open it up
3517995 we beijingers are far from the beach so we dont get to see this very much its very fun and entertaining and sexy too
3517996 they are for my son he is in the army now and cant be here
3517997 she did very well as i know shes very tired and didnt recover so well from the final a national record is a good achievement the last couple of days have been such a rush of adrenaline and its hard to keep up such a high for a long period of time
3517998 our goal was to make the olympic final for the 100m fly and she did just that
3517999 there were two little girls who we were to choose between well we couldnt choose so we decided to take them both
3518000 honestly theyre just kids and the thing they need most is love theyre fantastic
3518001 no one wants the older children theyre just throw away kids no one cares no ones paying attention to them and we want to give them a chance

3518007 the dollar had an enormous spike in the past couple of weeks so the precious metals are losing their lustre
3518008 its certain that sentiment has turned around but for now theres some technical and psychological resistance just above us 800
3518009 it looks like a continuation of what seemed to be technical driven selling
3518010 when we talk to the landlords some may go back on their word even if certain conditions have been agreed on so we need everything in black and white and not rely on verbal agreements
3518011 with ie singapore theres a bit more structure and goal setting which forces us to plan further ahead
3518012 as long as we stand a chance in any competition we will go all out for it
3518013 in fact we have a good chance of beating home as our players will be going out there with less pressure the heat is on home united whore trying to keep pace with saffc
3518014 our missing players is a minus but on the plus side we have others who are hungry to play and prove their worth to claim a spot in the first team
3518015 all the matches between our two teams have always been played like derbies so they will definitely be taking this match seriously
3518016 sure they will be thinking about sundays cup match against us but do you think they will pull out of a tackle in a 50 50 situation just because of that
3518017 sportsmen hate to lose so you can be sure theyll do all they can to try and beat us when they are on the pitch
3518018 nobody locally can remember there being the sort of circumstances we have got right now the snow is exceptionally deep with snowdrifts of two to three metres and the potential for further avalanches is very high right now

3518023 as far as the seeds are concerned we have played the dutch and american teams before so we know what to expect weve done video analysis on both teams to make sure we address all the issues
3518024 the message has always been the same no matter what the competition
3518025 i will tell them to adapt quickly to the opponents play because although weve studied them they may throw something new into the game
3518026 of course the team will also have to apply my instructions during the match that is what i will tell them tomorrow
3518027 we thought it could be a very easy game for us obviously that was a misunderstanding
3518028 a federal judge ordered three college students to cancel a sunday presentation at a computer hackers conference where they planned to show security flaws in the automated fare system used by bostons subway for educational use only
3518029 the presentation was distributed to conference attendees on cds on thursday before the conference officially began and the transit system filed suit
3518030 i believe cesc will be ready he has worked very hard since he came back
3518031 you cannot say he will be at his best but he will be fit enough to win big trophies makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you
3518032 at 21 he already has a lot of experience he is an intelligent boy but i would not like to put too much pressure on him we know every single player in his area is very important
3518033 if theres someone who already knows the person well when there is an introduction its very different when you sit down and talk
3518034 i also recruited teachers who are very well received here in singapore
3518035 if we want to invest or recruit their staff weve got to understand their culture background language and ambitions
3518036 for example they make recommendations on which lawyers to consider otherwise the other lawyers you hunt for yourself may make you just pay and pay
3518037 there are others who attended and did not find it that beneficial because they did not have their objectives worked out
3518038 there is an increasing awareness among our companies on the need to groom capable employees for their international operations
3518039 this may lead to higher attrition rates and cause business operations to slow down
3518040 that makes us look forward and theres a lot of things to learn and be exposed to
3518041 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define its a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more

3518047 the party platform demonizes semiautomatic sport utility rifles and wants them banned calls for anti gun show legislation and proposes so called common sense gun laws many democrats believe bans on most guns are common sense and they still support the handgun ban in barack obamas hometown of chicago boiled down all it really means is that the democrats are still the party of gun control no matter how they try to re package the rhetoric and they know it
3518048 the partys gun control platform plank puts the lie to everything they say
3518049 as democrats descend on denver to nominate a candidate who is on record in opposition to sensible concealed carry laws we encourage gun owners across the country and especially in colorado to remind the party that the supreme court in june held that gun bans are unconstitutional
3518050 even after a study done for the justice department found that gun shows are rarely the source of firearms used by criminals
3518051 democrats have an opportunity to reject and repudiate this platform
3518052 if they do not that tells american gun owners everything they need to know about democrats as november approaches

3518059 does not have a basis for determining that the 19 companies remain especially vulnerable to the illegal distort and short schemes that the emergency order prevented
3518060 singapores respect for intellectual property strong legal system world leading infrastructure talented and hardworking population makes us delighted to be here

3518412 there is still some oil production from the caspian and it is being exported through two other routes one is a rail link from baku to batumi
3518413 and the other link one is another pipeline known as the northern route and that is operated by the azerbaijan national company socar from baku to novorossisk
3518414 what has been suspended as a precaution because of the problems in georgia is the production of gas into the pipeline at baku
3518415 but a gas pipeline is high pressure so you can still supply gas out the other end into turkey even though you are not pumping gas into it at baku and there is probably several days of supply still in turkey
3518416 although bp has halted oil shipments along smaller pipelines through georgia as a precaution the quantities of crude oil involved are relatively small and in any case may soon resume if moscows announcement this morning of a halt to military operations proves to be a step towards de escalation
3518417 that is not to say that there are no important ramifications for the oil market from recent events in the caucasus
3518418 in the context of falling non opec crude oil output from other parts of the world this extra oil is vital
3518419 what has been highlighted over the past few days is that despite the careful routing of pipelines to avoid both russia and the middle east it still comes with a very significant degree of political risk

3518484 were under attack by the intellectual and educated segment of society
3518485 ill bet the support of universal health care corresponds well with college education too
3518486 first socialism requires planning of outputs in the classic models unless you have some means of planning who will get sick with what diseases or injuries and when the health care system can never be socialism
3518487 second any economic study would show that delivery of medical care is cheaper than not delivering it
3518488 reading a book on economics and studying health care economics are not the same things
3518489 universal health care by the way would be the christian thing to do
3518490 does this poster ealise that evry eu country switerland norway has
3518491 i guess im the 5 since im a libertarian i embrace some conservative views but definitely not of their religious and anti science ones in fact education is one of the few places i think the government should focus on
3518492 with a highly educated workforce we wont need welfare or any social security nets
3518493 ah i now see why i had mikko in the filter file i will just put him back there now
3518494 do you even know how much we spend on insurance
3518495 i didnt say capitalism didnt work i said our healthcare system isnt
3518496 i have nothing against captialism but it must be managed
3518497 conservatives got their chance here and what did they do
3518498 also the only president to preside over an economic boom in the past 20 years was a liberal democrat
3518499 actually im not sure conservatives have had any positive record when it comes to the u s economy in the past century
3518500 it is absolutely safe to say that if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution that person is ignorant stupid or insane or wicked but id rather not consider that
3518501 americans need to wait forever if one lacks the best insurance about 100 million americans are grossly under served and 50 million have almost no access at all except at the most expensive end the emergency room once they are close to death
3518502 50 million have almost no access at all except at the most expensive end the emergency room once they are close to death
3518503 forgive me but this sounds a bit like the rhetoric we get from right wingers that our social security system is
3518504 ah i see our education system is falling apart too but it seems that most other countries have education statistics that trump ours
3518505 i supposed europe and east asia can only have viable public education systems because we dont though
3518506 those countries which have invested in massive public education and wiping out illiteracy over the last 150 years have failed miserably while those who have not are top tier world economies
3518507 i am sure finland is worried that they consistently rank near the top in education health care and economic competitiveness
3518508 you lost my interest when you conflated the health care system in canada to socialism
3518509 i am sure finland is worried that they consistently rank near the top in education health care and economic competitiveness

3518512 you lost my interest when you conflated the health care system in canada to socialism
3518513 i am sure finland is worried that they consistently rank near the top in education health care and economic competitiveness
3518514 gorgonzola i think you lost your way www freerepublic com will be more than happy to accomodate your worldview
3518515 ah i now see why i had mikko in the filter file i will just put him back there now
3518516 this article reads like it was written by john kerry the genius that brought us the notion that only the uneducated were in the military
3518517 i supposed europe and east asia can only have viable public education systems because we dont though
3518518 those countries which have invested in massive public education and wiping out illiteracy over the last 150 years have failed miserably while those who have not are top tier world economies
3518519 i am sure finland is worried that they consistently rank near the top in education health care and economic competitiveness
3518520 kill them all god will know those who are his
3518521 were a small country we cant afford to let anyone flunk
3518522 is it it certainly is important but is it more important than bare survival
3518523 it can lead to all that sure but it can also lead to phenomena like
3518524 if you throw money at the rich they pocket it they dont invest it
3518525 would be great if it were so it just isnt
3518526 companies think about the profits of the next quarter and thats it in the vast majority of cases
3518527 governments rarely think more than 4 years ahead either which is still often not enough but thats already a factor of 16
3518528 not having good ideas wont be selected against long as this doesnt lead to immediate extinction bankruptcy or as long as nobody has a good idea
3518529 but the oil field in alaska is tiny the destroying a unique ecosystem for 6 months worth of oil is not just evil its dumb as in darth vader and his emperor would not do it
3518530 yes not only is the us system way more expensive for the taxpayers
3518531 it also simply fails to care for lots of people
3518532 a shoot an 8 cm long nail into his head and b survive it because he wasnt able to afford a private insurance he didnt have any he got sixty thousand dollars in debt for having that nail removed from his brain thats insane and its impossible over here
3518533 the thing is you see that private insurance companies are just that companies they want to make a profit countries dont need to make a profit they can afford moral arguments
3518534 my friend this paragraph either means that you believe in the omniscience omnipotence and omnibenevolence of the free market which is a religious position
3518535 for example the fact that everyone goes to the same type of school rather than there being a separation between good and bad students around age 14 flies in the face of european conservative dogma and seems to support the socialist dogma
3518536 notwithstanding these achievements large inequalities in access to tertiary education by social origin still persist in finland participation rates in university education among young students aged 20 24 differ considerably according to the education background of their parents the relative chance of entering university education has remained at least ten times higher during the last decade for those coming from academic home background compared to students from less educated families the expansion of the tertiary system appears to have narrowed the relative advantage of an academic home background to seven fold
3518537 once more as a system of economy capitalism is good planning the economy has been tried in half the world and has failed everywhere so apart from communism being evil dictatorship it doesnt work but the fact that water knows best how to flow downhill doesnt mean we dont or shouldnt build any dams or canals
3518538 i and most people knew what kerry meant that it is the uneducated as in those who are guided by revelation as opposed to the insights provided by history and fact based intelligence who get us the country stuck in a quagmire that being iraq anyone who presents it differently is either unable to discern anything beyond superficialities or deliberately distorting kerrys words to further their own agenda i e lying which would lead me to question anything the distorter has to say
3518539 i will now bow down slavishly to the bush regime and lick georges cow patty stained boots
3518540 sandt and jason put up or shut up im still waiting for you to either back up your claim that the us provides europe with pharmaceuticals or concede that you were talking out of the wrong end of your anatomy
3518541 regarding global warming some of us have sufficient scientific litteracy to judge the models for ourselves and denialism will not convince us
3518542 regarding privatisation what has been happening en europe is not privatisation and deregulation its either privatisation or deregulation for any given field
3518543 oh and im still waiting for you to explain why gdp is a better indicator of wealth than say median real wage
3518544 robert the more you dont agree with their opinion the shriller and unfortunately longer their posts become just back away slowly
3518545 considering that what i posted wasnt directly associated with the thread i figured id put in my two cents and then as you suggested back away slowly
3518546 however in a somewhat related vein the question that included the phrase thinking scientifically was ironic
3518547 just as a scientist does before coming to a conclusion about a hypothesis
3518548 in this case i would consider senator kerrys own past support for the military his status as a veteran his antipathy toward the bush administrations iraq policy and the president himself the context of his speech his own explanation for what he said and so forth
3518549 im not a huge kerry supporter but the consensus outside of the faux news corridors was that he just flubbed up
3518550 a free market by economic definition requires several conditions including 1 no barriers to entry 2 perfect information between buyer and seller 3 indistinguishable products between sellers 4 a very large number of sellers 5 no control of prices
3518551 this does not exist there are no examples of completely free markets
3518552 the simpliest example is a company with a monopoly which has eliminated the requirement for a large number of sellers
3518553 this is basic economics as taught to me in my mba program
3518554 unbridled capitalism unrestrained greed gives us miners who are minors sellers of stockshares in companies which didnt exist sludge in our rivers and smog in our air
3518555 regulated capitalism can prohibit companies from hiring minors without review
3518556 regulated capitalism can punish those who are caught commiting fraud which is only possible due to a disparity of information
3518557 regulated capitalism can have the power of a free market as a goal even knowing it will never get there by trying to eliminate the disparity of information between seller and buyer
3518558 help to reduce the barrier to entry of new firms by providing start up capital
3518559 under real capitalism you are prohibited by law from releasing poisonous material that harms other people or their property against their will
3518560 who creates and enforces the law which prohibits a company from releasing poisonous material do you really think that companies would do this voluntarily or does your version of real capitalism include government regulation as this sentance implies
3518561 delivery of information may be easier under a free market but discovery of information is not
3518562 would enrons missuse of special purpose entities been discovered if they had not been required to file sec statements
3518563 information is valuable companies spend a great deal of time and money protecting their information
3518564 another thing you and a lot of other people as well have apparently forgotten is that the government is us
3518565 the government is not an enemy the only reason nhtsa or the fda or the census bureau or the labor department require this information to be reported and disseminated is because we the people not you the individual asked them to
3518566 the reason there is a minimun wage is because as a society we decided that people who work shouldnt be slowly starving to death or enter into debt hell because of the inherent advantage employers have over employees
3518567 since the mathematics of economics cleary show that the greatest benefit for consumers arrives if the market is in perfect competition i assumed that this was the goal you were aiming for
3518568 this can be achieved through aiming for perfect competition but not by un regulated free if you prefer competition
3518569 youre all for un regulated competition even if the consumers are hurt by it
3518570 if im reading your distinction correctly you dont care a whit about the consumer only about maximizing the profits for a company
3518571 the reason there is a minimun wage is because as a society we decided that people who work shouldnt be slowly starving to death or enter into debt hell because of the inherent advantage employers have over employees
3518572 the thing is you see that private insurance companies are just that companies they want to make a profit countries dont need to make a profit they can afford moral arguments
3518573 not supporting tax breaks for the richest 1 of the population is science as i have mentioned reagan has done the experiment and the tax breaks failed to make the poor any richer
3518574 bush the lesser finding that discovery at odds with his ideology is repeating the experiment and it is having the same outcome again now you say the whole world should repeat the experiment yet once more
3518575 regarding finland i didnt talk about tertiary education how many people do flunk
3518576 but you see my freedom ends where yours begins and vice versa
3518577 for example i dont have the freedom to pay you less than a living wage because this infringes on your freedom to live an ordinary life
3518578 of course but you see the people in charge of enron were too stupid to see that
3518579 you seem to systematically overlook the fact that the decisions in capitalism like everywhere else are made by fallible human beings democracy is the best we can do to mitigate the sometimes problematic outcomes of that fact
3518580 you accept that enron will repeat itself again and again and worse and worse
3518581 communism is the idea that heaven on earth should be brought about by means of violent revolution socialism wants to do that in parliament the democratic way
3518582 socialism is liberal on social issues and largely liberal on economic issues communism is not liberal on anything
3518583 if you leave capitalism to itself you get monopolies instead of competition standard oil united fruit company itt
3518584 come on by that logic atheism and christianity are identical because they say something about god
3518585 excuse me in universal health care doctors are still paid and still make a profit
3518586 of fucking course sure you can afford spending lets see if i can divide 60 000 by 300 million assuming flat tax which is fortunately wrong 0 00002

3518596 the recent stock market bubble was a direct result of the relaxation of sec reporting requirements
3518597 and i blame the deregulation for the creation of the bubble
3518598 but by that argument counterfeiters shouldnt be punished because they made their own money
3518599 by living in a society you have agreed to abide by that societies definition of property the most you can do is argue to change the definition
3518600 i do not support the idea of individuals using brute force to wrest your property from you it is not the same as an authorized representative of the law seperating you from your property
3518601 so in your opinion any regulation is an unnecessary burden
3518602 so your opinion trumps the mathematics of economics which clearly indicates that the consumer benefits most under perfect competition yet you accuse me of being dogmatic
3518603 as i said previously this shows a marked disregard for the consumers
3518604 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3518605 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3518606 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3518607 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3518608 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3518620 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3518621 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3518622 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3518623 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me

3518632 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

3518634 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3518635 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3518636 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3518639 una excelente noticia que ahora se sumen a la pol tica trasvasista
3518640 ha quedado demostrado que la desalaci n ha sido un rotundo fracaso a pesar de la defensa a ultranza que ha hecho el psrm que por sumisi n a su partido abandon la defensa de los trasvases cuando la regi n m s les necesitaba
3518641 que es normal que el gobierno de extremadura no conozca la decisi n porque es una propuesta del ministerio de medio ambiente y no hay a n ninguna decisi n firme por lo que hay que esperar al estudio
3518642 derivar agua para otros fines no nos parece una soluci n porque existen otras alternativas en otros territorios que se pueden utilizar

3518653 do you believe that demonic possession causes heads to spin
3518654 most people dont understand demonology they think demons are like ghosts and equate them with haunted houses thats not what demonology is about
3518655 i cant prove god exists that demons exist that angels exist theyre invisible you cant touch them feel them smell them but sometimes something so absolutely marvelous and wonderful happens beyond what you believe is mans ability to make things happen likewise there are things so awful so hideous so dumb that you just cant believe man is responsible for that activity so you look for evidence of satan
3518656 the number of demon possessed people compared to the number of people in the world is minuscule

3519033 the policy of the government is not to deny anyone ones right to express
3519034 we are not paying enough attention to test cricket which is the genuine form of the game
3519035 we have to get our priorities right in the odis a spinner cannot bowl more than ten overs and it is only four in a twenty20 game the entire approach of a spinner changes in a test the field placings are completely different you need to see off spells without being negative you need to prepare mentally and tactically
3519036 when the entire team gets together you sit down and chart out a strategy you anticipate different situations have a game plan you discuss each bowler about how you would counter them as a pack
3519037 they did not use their feet enough they should have stepped out more often
3519038 mendis and murali bowled well but were also allowed to do so they created the pressure changed the angles bowled over and round the wicket but surely our batsmen had the credentials to cope with them better
3519039 like most biotech companies the revenues are not significant until they become a product producing company
3519040 what is worrying is that the growth of six core infrastructure industries which include mining petroleum electricity and steel and account for 26 68 per cent of industrial production has also slowed down
3519041 we are in an industrial scenario which appears decisively weak the iip may pick up but it is going to be slightly subdued vis a vis last year the underlying trend is that growth is weakening
3519042 industry is expectantly looking at the government to move ahead with the reforms agenda to give a leg up to industrial growth
3519043 we expect this weakness to spread to the services sector because of the financial sector turbulence

3519047 what makes you know that you have to make use of this strategy is it something you hear see or feel maybe even taste or smell
3519048 what must happen in order for you to execute the strategy
3519049 i need to feel extremely nervous and get my hands cold that is when i begin to jump around to psyche myself up for the audience by the time i am done jumping i see the audience in my mind enthralled
3519050 nervous means i am breathing heavier and my heart is pumping harder than normal
3519051 does it mean that i need to get nervous before i know i am ready for the audience what might happen if i was perfectly calm
3519052 well if you were perfectly calm it means that you have met the audience before or you know your topic inside out and have been doing the same thing over and over again
3519053 of course if i am not nervous i do not think i can really psyche myself up and perform at my best
3519054 it might be that we keep or divest or enter into joint ventures or collaboration

3519098 there is no justification for the current rise in prices
3519099 there has been a paradigm shift in the energy world whereby oil producers are no longer inclined to rapidly exhaust their resource for the sake of accelerating the misuse of a precious and finite commodity this sentiment prevails inside and outside of opec countries but has yet to be appreciated among the major energy consuming countries of the world

3519135 i actually think that given the number of comments made from industry executives at e3 or thereabouts about how they didnt put enough resources against development of wii games that the industry has realized that the old adage of only first party games sell on nintendo systems is absolutely incorrect i think youre right that the data will cause a few eyebrows to lift
3519136 total third party sales for the xbox 360 since launch is currently 67 929 999 units followed by the wii at 33 394 311 units and the playstation 3 at 19 976 325 units
3519137 third party sales for the xbox 360 since the launch of the wii and ps3 is 54 065 728 units still almost double the wiis 33 394 311 units
3519138 no matter how you slice it the wii third party game story is not a pretty one
3519139 sold 60 million total software units where 56 percent are third party units or 33 million keep in mind that this does not include wii sports since its in pack with the hardware it is not counted as a software sale
3519140 35 million software units 84 percent of which were third party or 29 million total
3519141 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3519142 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3519143 this shows the risk of not going with a tried and tested solution
3519144 this is the patent age of new inventions for killing bodies and for saving souls all propagated with the best intentions

3519146 if there were a robbery in the neighbourhood you might worry that it could happen again and maybe in your own home that is a normal generalized anxiety thinking that there is someone in your house and that checking and rechecking the locks tapping counting and retracing your steps will prevent it from happening to you is ocd

3519173 so i purchased the acme non snore mouthpiece and now we have no trouble sleeping at night
3519174 i used his credit card and spent 60 we didnt have on a 2 mouthpiece and now hes so mad at me he sleeps on the couch and i fall asleep right away in my cold loveless bed
3519175 now that i bought my husband the acme non snore mouthpiece were both sleeping through the night without having to wake up and say shhhh
3519176 damn i fucked up i blew 60 on a 2 mouthpiece and were both sleeping good now because my husband left me and im so depressed about it im knocking back a 1 75l of smirnoff every night before i go to bed and cry myslef to sleep while hes out fucking an 18 year old stripper that wasnt dumb enough to pay 60 for a 2 mouthpiece
3519177 the best thing is i put it on in the evening and when i wake up in the morning im still gay

3519192 many of the vulnerabilities addressed by the fixes could be exploited if a windows user simply views a malformed image or visits a malicious web site a favorite attack method among cybercriminals
3519193 this is a mammoth patch tuesday and we have not seen anything of this scale in a long time
3519194 instead of having to deal with a number of competing proprietary and open source parallel file systems pnfs will allow users to reap the benefits of parallel storage systems by choosing best of breed solutions without having concerns over vendor lock in
3519195 nfs is getting pressure from clustered file systems like lustre and gpfs as well as custom file systems produced by web 2 0 service providers such as google gfs
3519196 even for files too small to stripe those files can be distributed across multiple nfs servers which provides statistical load balancing
3519197 with a capable cluster of nfs servers and a back end file system files or ranges within files can be relocated transparent to the applications accessing data over pnfs
3519198 pnfs moves the metadata server out of the data transfer path
3519199 instead of having to deal with a number of competing proprietary and open source parallel file systems pnfs will allow users to reap the benefits of parallel storage systems by choosing best of breed solutions without having concerns over vendor lock in
3519200 for environments that need improved performance for large sequential files where parallel access is needed pnfs has some legs moving forward
3519201 however not every environment or application needs parallel access to data
3519202 for mainstream markets pnfs will most likely remain a niche at least near term being used for specialized applications and environments
3519203 the big benefactors of pnfs will be the parallel file systems like those from ibm sun ibrix and others as well as proprietary storage systems like those from panasas
3519204 the architecture for the pnfs proposal was derived from the panasas directflow parallel protocol which is a core component utilized by the panasas panfs parallel file system
3519205 the directflow protocol used in our activestor parallel storage clusters currently provides essentially all of the functionality expected to be available in the nfs 4 1 later this year
3519206 we expect to review them in september and have someone onboard in october

3519209 the best for less records give you top quality for less money than any other recorded form
3519210 because theyre flat and not bulky you can store hundreds in a minimum of space and still see every title
3519211 with records its easy to pick out the songs you want to play

3519213 we have about 90 000 small businesses here in indiana but only about 34 percent of them are able to provide health insurance benefits to their employees

3519275 by leveraging technology were providing our airmen multiple access points to view the list

3519278 so on the morning of the 20th we want people to be aware that they can go to any of the three public venues to see if they are a selectee
3519279 prior to this change retirees had to have 20 years of active duty service or be retired at age 60 from the guard or reserve
3519280 if you didnt have 20 years you werent eligible however with the ndaa expansion if you are medically retired either permanently or temporarily and you have va payments that reduce your retirement pay you are eligible to apply for crsc
3519281 that way if you do not qualify and something in the law or department of defense crsc policy changes in the future that could affect the prior decision like the 2008 ndaa we will already have a claim and documentation and can reassess a claim based on the new eligibility factors
3519282 if you answered yes to those questions and have not submitted your crsc claim you should do so
3519283 the money is tax free and could help pay medical expenses or improve your quality of life
3519284 getting justice dignity and compensation for survivors of childhood sexual abuse is what matters
3519285 when i was 12 or 13 years old she had told me that in 18th century japan the geisha who were known for their beauty and their porcelain skin needed something to remove all the heavy make up they wore
3519286 at the time the make up contained lead which was very damaging to their skin
3519287 so they tried everything to take it off and nothing worked and then they tried the nightingale droppings and it not only worked but it left their skin smooth
3519288 when i explain to my customers they think i misspoke because of my accent
3519289 but after they understand many of them are willing to trust me and give it a try
3519290 she e mailed me some information i definitely needed to know more before i committed to the procedure
3519291 but then i thought about it and the japanese have been doing it for such a long time and the geishas have such beautiful skin even though they put such harsh chemicals on it
3519292 it doesnt feel as abrasive as some other facials and it smells organic
3519293 and it doesnt tingle or burn it just sort of stays there its a really simple calming facial
3519294 this song evokes the theme that everybody wants to stop war and that makes me think of the men and women who are out there fighting wars for us it reminds me that the veterans need and deserve our help
3519295 the nvf is a national non profit non governmental organization dedicated to bettering the lives of veterans and their families and honoring their service to our country
3519296 we are proud of our veterans and honored to be able to assist the nvf in this small way after all no group has been more affected by war then our veterans and that is why we are pleased to help the nvf

3519302 that the absence of edwards would have helped barack obama
3519303 that two thirds of edwards supporters would have supported clinton is just not supported in data collected directly from those who actually participated in the caucuses
3519304 had edwards not been running and if nothing else had changed my data suggest that obama would have ended up even further ahead of clinton than he was
3519305 as the campaign progressed few edwards supporters i knew gave any indication that clinton was their second choice in my own caucus which i chaired when our edwards group was initially declared non viable there was discussion of moving but to obama not clinton in the end we gained viability by bringing over bill richardson and joe biden forces and by negotiating with the obama group
3519306 redlawsk noted that by the time iowas county conventions rolled around march 15 edwards had dropped out many edwards delegations remained a separate viable group but where they did not the move to obama was massive in the end obama picked up nearly half of edwards supporters while clinton picked up almost none of the four iowans elected as edwards national convention delegates including redlawsk all publicly moved to obama on june 3 none went to clinton

3519327 people think im really confident but i do get self conscious like many women about stripping off in public
3519328 i havent been willingly photographed in a bikini for seven years and i dont think ill do it again at the moment im a bit curvier having done the tour so it was a big mental step forward for me to show my natural self rather than my worked out honed self
3519329 i did strive to have my most perfect body and in moments when i lack confidence that voice is always there waiting to tell me you are not good enough do better but im more conscious of it
3519330 i think all supermodels now are losing out to celebrities its celebrities who are getting the cosmetics contracts
3519331 they love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
3519332 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive
3519333 i want to clear nikkis name all her father did was step into the fight to try and break it up

3519336 it isnt true that we have loaned vagner love to everton there are no negotiations about that
3519337 oh those poor middle easterners that would never happen here
3519338 so youre claiming that your long term exposure to cedar chips in your plastic cage has caused you serious health problems isnt that correct mr chinchilla
3519339 but isnt it really correct that you were never housed in a plastic cage for more than a couple years
3519340 no way jose after i escaped from the plastic cage i continued to use cedar chips as my preferred bedding because i was totally addicted to them by that time
3519341 i see mr chinchilla much like youre addicted to hamburgers isnt that true
3519342 mr chinchilla let me show you your answer to interrogatory number 56 part a section three paragraph five
3519343 would you please read your answer to interrogatory number 56 part a section three paragraph five to me
3519344 let the record reflect that the chinchilla refuses to answer the question
3519345 isnt it true that your answer to interrogatory number fifty seven part a section 3 reads and i quote i really love eating hamburgers i eat them as often as i can i think i might even love eating hamburgers more than i love sex thats why the chinchilla eats hamburgers whenever wherever he can do you think i can have a hamburger after i finish these interrogatories
3519346 how many hamburgers have you had over the course of your life mr chinchilla
3519347 and these burgers that you eat are they regular size hamburgers
3519348 by regular size i mean are they the same size as the ones people eat
3519349 well duh whoever heard of anyone serving a chinchilla size burger thats just ridiculous
3519350 so basically youre telling me that you eat over 300 people size burgers a year right
3519351 and each burger that you eat is about one third the size of your entire chinchilla body right
3519352 mr chinchilla isnt it really true that your hamburger eating habit has caused your health problems
3519353 yes yes yes it was the hamburgers the chinchilla cannot live this lie anymore hamburgers hamburgers it was all those toxic hamburgers i ate the hamburgers made me sick i tried to blame it on those cedar chips but i cant hide the truth ahahahahahahahahah

3519356 so your saying i got bad service but yet want to sue me for back service fee that you just said was wrong
3519357 oh ok so between january 2008 and may 2008 before cheryl challenger was my case manager you were my acting case manager and you did not inspect my room
3519358 oh so you are the program manager and you dont know who my case manager was for 6 months and you are saying i owe you a service fee when you cant even tell me who that service was being provided by
3519359 sus didnt provide you with the service but we are going to charge you for the bad service anyways

3519367 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3519368 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3519369 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3519370 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation

3519373 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
3519374 whatever mistakes tblisi has made they cannot justify russias actions
3519375 moscow has invaded a neighbor an illegal act of aggression that violates the u n charter and fundamental principles of cooperation and security in europe
3519376 beginning a well planned war as the olympics were opening violates the ancient tradition of a truce to conflict during the games
3519377 they kind of freak me out a little bit but ill be o k
3519378 we do worry about those children who are not immunized with the potential of different kinds of outbreaks or disease processes and weve seen that

3519406 these past months have been historic times for our party and for our country millions of americans young and old from every walk of life every race and creed have come forward and done what so many have claimed they would never do take an active and real role in their nations future i feel truly humbled that so many of those people chose to support my bid for the democratic party nomination for president to them no words can possibly express my thanks for your time energy enthusiasm and support this experience has further cemented my belief in our system our party and our process and i want all of you to know that this is by no means the end of my own journey i look forward to serving the people of new york as their senator for 8 more years during the administration of president obama at which point i can tell you all that i intend to help our party and our nation make history yet again the question that our party faces at this time is how best to reflect the stated preference of those millions of americans who preferred that i be the decmocratic party nominee for president there has been much debate in the media and on the internet about whether i should formally be nominated at our upcoming convention to those supporters i say this your votes were cast to send a message and that message has been received loud and clear it has been received by myself it has been received by our party leadership it has been received by the next president of the united states barack obama and it has been received by the world at large you said that we want to be heard and i am here today to tell you that with barack obama as our next commander in chief we will be heard with that mission accomplished then i wish to make it perfectly clear that i in no way intend to stand for or accept nomination at our upcoming convention the people have spoken and made their choice and as committed democrats it is our duty obligation and honour to stand behind that choice barack obama our party must unite behind senator obama and ensure the future prosperity and international reputation of our nation by putting all of our energies behind winning the white house this november and giving the common people back their voice in the halls of power
3519407 its really interesting to see how american ideas about crime fighting apply to a different culture
3519408 we have found that some strategies work and others dont translate as well taking the skills ive learned in the masters degree program and applying them in another country is an opportunity not many students get the chance to experience
3519409 while youth drug and alcohol use is lower there than in the u s violence in the schools is a serious problem
3519410 the report was well received and resulted in several new innovations in how police and government officials respond to crime
3519411 andrew gained first hand knowledge of the challenges researchers often face when attempting to collect data in a foreign country
3519412 we often encountered suspicion and reluctance to participate in the survey on the part of the people we were attempting to interview i think andrew gained a healthy appreciation of the realities of the research enterprise
3519413 i was working in the besson street police station which is in the most violent part of trinidad
3519414 this station houses a special police unit whose mission is to capture the most wanted criminals
3519415 we went through trial transcripts to gather information about defendants victims the trial proceedings and outcomes
3519416 we had meetings with court officials and spent time reading records from their magistrates court once again these records were not computerized
3519417 it was an eye opening experience for both of us and especially for kristine who had never worked with court data before
3519418 the case files were stored in a vault at the court and we spent hours just trying to figure out how to find the files we needed reading the case transcripts illustrated the enormous differences in criminal law and procedure in the united states compared to trinidad and tobago
3519419 i have enjoyed learning about the culture of trinidad and tobago and eating local cuisine
3519420 from a professional perspective i have learned a great deal from dr katz and dr spohn that i will be able to carry with me when i do research
3519421 through this data driven police transformation project we are working to reduce violent crime on the islands particularly homicides and assaults with firearms
3519422 saving the npt and the nonproliferation regime in an era of nuclear renaissance
3519423 at a tipping point with its viability in the balance
3519424 the rapid advance of irans nuclear program in clear violation of international law is by far and away the no 1 threat to the vitality of the nuclear nonproliferation regime
3519425 an iranian nuclear arsenal should it be achieved seems likely to unleash a cascade of proliferation across the middle east
3519426 likely lead to the worldwide collapse of the already tottering nuclear non proliferation regime
3519427 help convince irans leadership that the price for its nuclear program has become too high
3519428 take care of ourselves and each other spend time with loved ones take breaks when necessary and enjoy each moment on this lovely green and blue planet
3519429 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
3519430 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
3519431 by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
3519432 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
3519433 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
3519434 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
3519435 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
3519436 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
3519437 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
3519438 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
3519439 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
3519440 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
3519441 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
3519442 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
3519443 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
3519444 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
3519445 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
3519446 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

3519506 dvd 4 is an attempt to focus now on nm and a little bit of what my part was in all of this as i mentioned in dvd 1 avadhut nityananda appeared to me in the early 70s actually it was the consciousness the same consciousness thats in all of us appeared and that consciousness is what brought me to india and eventually to sri nm the same consc just appearing in two different bodies or forms or the appearance of two different bodies or forms in dvd1 we wanted to cover the overview of maharaj and in dvd 2 certainly the conceptual framework and deconstructing it as not this not this through dvd3 we looked at nargajuna and nagarjunas relationship and buddhist relationship to sri nm and his teachings and finally in dvd4 this particular one we go back to india ketwadi maharajs home back to his gurus mahasamadhi shrine siddhamaheshwar and now back to ganeshpuri where it all started for me and where it all ends in this dvd we get into the final teachings of sri nm which come in four steps four stages he would say stage one im not my thoughts memory emotions associations perceptions body sensations im the nonverbal i am not dependent upon that step two the i am which i am begins to dissolve as it dissolves and the consciousness arises all of a sudden im just pure impersonal consciousness the same consciousness thats in everyone no different and finally the last stage of sri nm prior to consciousness the stage where ive never heard anywhere or seen anywhere where he actually says the consciousness itself is temporary its not you who are you i am that or sometimes hed even say beyond that the nothingness the absolute prior to consciousness and thats where were going
3519507 nm taught forget the teachings just stay in the consciousness and thatll be the portal to the absolute
3519508 im going to give you objective knowledge to objectively show you that its all an illusion
3519509 actions occur the i arises later and takes the blame or praise for the action
3519510 nm was trying to give objective knowledge that whatever occurs pleasurable or painful is part of the illusion
3519511 one what basis is one confident about his existence what does it depend on the knowledge of i am no question or a problem lasts forever consider this point of view and you will find reason why this beingness disappears this is your confidence that you are your knowledge that you are on what does it depend and because of what this confidence that this beingness goes away
3519512 even the experience of i am is a concept its temporary it comes one day and it will go
3519513 when you realize consciousness is not the truth then you are beyond consciousness
3519514 meditation means to be the meditator rather than the object of meditation
3519515 are you experiencing and doing meditation or does the concept of an i meditating appear on the you prior to words
3519516 the reason realization is always missed is because its always there we go after thoughts memories associations perceptions feelings as though they are real and that if we change them we change who we are always missing who we are
3519517 the you that is always there is the you that always goes unnoticed
3519518 when they asked nisargadatta how long it would take he replied
3519519 forget me forget my teachings stay in the consciousness and your own unique path will emerge
3519520 i ask you to abide in that state thats the highest eternal state what is the profound knowledge that he defines he says to realize that state prior to conception whatever that state is the eternal state to abide in that state that is the highest let me give that state a name i will label it parabraham state now for our sake he says i will attach a label to that he calls it the parabrahma state absolute state
3519521 there is no distinction between outside space and inside space its all space only so where is the question of coming in and going out
3519522 maharaj said to me there is no person its all a concept its all an illusion and with one flick of the hand light pierced through me and there was just the absolute nothingness
3519523 if you can forget it or remember it its not you therefore discard it
3519524 do not give up the action or the fruit of the action just give up the desire for the action or the fruit of the action
3519525 the state 8 days before conception or maybe thousands of years prior to that whatever that state is other than birth as the body is the ever prevailing state or the eternal state
3519526 i am the bhakta i worship the consc i worship the self

3519555 when i first saw the middlesex country register of deeds stealing taxpayer money i was shocked and dismayed i immediately wanted to run to restore professionalism and ethics to that office
3519556 it is highly troubling that a public official would engage in the kind of brazen theft of public monies that we allege here
3519557 we believe that mr buonomo violated the publics trust by regularly accessing these cash machines without authority and stealing taxpayer money
3519558 its expelled going to appeal to the religious the paranoid the conspiracy theorists and the ignorant which means theyre going to draw in about 90 of the market

3519566 for the residents and neighbourhoods that comprise the manurewa community this prospect is doubly concerning
3519567 as a community we simply do not need the bad profile associated with this kind of incident because it diminishes the reputation of a place that is home to over 80 000 people the vast majority of whom are good law abiding folk
3519568 by any measure the residents of weymouth constantly make every effort to ensure that their neighbourhood is safe
3519569 notwithstanding the worrying prospect of the outcome of last nights incident weymouth will remain a great place to live both now and in the future

3519627 you are directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why you should remain a national delegate

3519644 in 1986 our existing rules made sense at that time very few federal action agencies had any in depth expertise with section 7 and listed species but that is not the case today we are not being good stewards of our resources when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3519645 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3519646 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3519675 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3519676 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3519677 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3519678 just so you all know we did set a record
3519679 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3519680 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3519681 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3519682 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
3519683 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
3519684 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3519685 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3519686 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3519687 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3519688 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3519689 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3519690 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3519691 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3519692 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3519693 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3519694 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3519695 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3519696 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3519697 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3519698 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3519699 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3519700 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3519701 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3519702 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3519703 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3519704 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3519705 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3519706 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3519707 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3519708 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3519709 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3519710 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3519711 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3519712 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3519713 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3519714 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3519715 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3519716 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3519717 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3519718 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3519719 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3519720 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3519721 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3519722 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3519723 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3519724 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3519725 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3519726 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3519727 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3519728 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3519729 thin film is really the leading edge for satisfying demand from the utility market
3519730 utilities are sophisticated buyers all they care about is the lowest cost
3519731 the whole market can see a lot of really impressive growth in the long run but thats not to say thin film will displace everything else
3519732 there are high hopes of them launching a business model with electric utilities
3519733 the utility market is a market that could be the gold mine for the solar industry but we dont know how the subsidies are going to play out
3519734 there are a number of key questions that nobody has an answer for
3519735 if the subsidy is given to utilities then all they need is first solar to come in and sell modules or systems
3519736 in that process utilities could potentially put more pressure on first solar to lower prices
3519737 renewable forms of energy including solar wind and tidal must be mainstreamed in order that they can substantially displace oil gas and coal many renewable forms are already being used in niche applications such as street signalling remote area power supply and village homes
3519738 a great deal of r amp d is required to bring solar energy costs down a strong government commitment to r amp d matched by an increasing scale of technology will help kickstart this change
3519739 when one energy source decreases then an alternate power takes over the grid when there is no wind power we switch over to gas or thermal when different streams feed into the grid we cannot distinguish between power coal oil or hydro
3519740 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
3519741 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3519742 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3519743 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3519744 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3519745 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3519746 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3519747 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3519748 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3519749 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3519750 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3519751 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3519752 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
3519753 are you better off now than you were four years ago
3519754 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3519755 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3519756 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3519757 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3519758 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3519759 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3519760 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3519761 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3519762 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3519763 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3519764 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3519765 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3519766 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3519767 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3519768 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3519769 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3519770 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3519771 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3519772 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3519773 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3519774 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3519775 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3519776 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3519777 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3519778 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3519779 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3519780 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3519781 sometimes the most obvious move isnt so obvious for us
3519782 and taking money and contracts out of the equation for instance getting a veteran who may slip through the waiver process it may look good on paper and create a buzz with the fans
3519783 youre better off bringing someone in who has been trained in a minor league system a major league spring training has experience in the ballpark and understands the value of two seam sink on a pitch throwing a changeup behind on the count all the things it takes in order to translate to success out here at this park
3519784 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3519785 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3519786 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3519787 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3519788 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3519789 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3519790 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3519791 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3519792 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3519793 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3519794 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3519795 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3519796 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3519797 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3519798 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3519799 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3519800 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3519801 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3519802 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3519803 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3519804 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3519805 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3519806 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3519807 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3519808 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3519809 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3519810 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3519811 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3519812 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3519813 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3519814 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3519815 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3519816 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3519817 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3519818 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3519819 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3519820 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3519821 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3519822 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3519823 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3519824 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3519825 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3519826 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3519827 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3519828 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3519829 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3519830 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3519831 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3519832 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3519833 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3519834 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3519835 permanent destruction of hundreds of thousands of acres of pristine public lands designated for multi purpose use that belong to the people
3519836 wilderness killing unacceptable groundwater depletion and the erosion of hard fought protections of public lands and private rights
3519837 our take has been from day one here we go again
3519838 here is where we can do everything out in the desert that we dont want to do in our own backyards in the city
3519839 the idea that were going to sacrifice critical pieces of our environment to protect other pieces of our environment seems a little ironic
3519840 thats an irony i cannot accept we have to find a way to do both
3519841 its not just businesses that have slowed things down its not just republicans that have slowed things down its also democrats and also environmental activists sometimes that slow things down
3519842 they say that we want renewable energy but we dont want you to put it anywhere we dont want you to use it
3519843 i dont know whether this is ironic or absurd but i mean if we cannot put solar power plants in the mojave desert i dont know where the hell we can put it
3519844 its better that the us do the drilling than china or cuba it will be a lot safer
3519845 he has a voting record to the left of vermont sen bernie sanders and sanders is a socialist
3519846 for me the issue is israel with obama you get louis farrakhan and rev jeremiah wright coming in the back door to the white house
3519847 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3519848 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3519849 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3519850 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3519851 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3519852 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3519853 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3519854 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3519855 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3519856 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3519857 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3519858 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3519859 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3519860 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3519861 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3519862 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3519863 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3519864 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3519865 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3519866 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3519867 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3519868 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3519869 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3519870 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3519871 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3519872 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3519873 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3519874 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3519875 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3519876 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3519877 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3519878 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3519879 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3519880 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3519881 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3519882 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3519883 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3519884 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3519885 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3519886 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3519887 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3519888 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3519889 cutting extreme poverty around the world in half by 2015
3519890 so the key to the upcoming election is whether white voters will be more less or equally likely to vote for obama as for kerry i believe the answer is less likely
3519891 just as the american revolution inspired mahatma gandhi to free a great people
3519892 even if you dont like both candidates you should vote for someone because if you dont then you have no business complaining for the next 4 years you did not allow your voice to be heard
3519893 does a governorship have more credibility than congressman or senator
3519894 the average age of elected presidents since 1952 the era of televised politics is 56
3519895 mccain is scare mongering and creating fear in americans just as weve seen republicans do in the last 8 years fear seems to work which is why they are doing it again get scared of the black guy etc etc very old politics of mcbush mcsame

3519915 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3519916 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3519917 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes

3519919 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3519920 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states

3519988 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3519989 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
