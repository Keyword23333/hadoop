4000002 it has been our policy to provide the media with convenient and sufficient access to the internet
4000003 i believe our policy will not affect reporters coverage of the olympic games
4000004 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
4000005 obviously if reporters cant access all the sites they want to see they cant do their jobs
4000006 unfortunately such restrictions are normal for reporters in china but the olympics were supposed to be different
4000007 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible

4000011 doctors used to feel that the blood pressure readings they got in their offices were the only ones they could rely on but that has changed
4000012 home testing is now an important part of monitoring when a patient brings in twice daily readings for a month i have a much more accurate record of their blood pressure control than i would get with office readings taken three or four times a year

4000020 his colorful flowers and unique compositions are reminiscent of a spring day
4000021 his unique perspective becomes clear in this series of archival inkjet prints that fit serial images into a single photographic frame
4000022 shes a master of dark room photography which is a lost art really
4000023 its a hard thing to achieve theres a method and a lot of technique behind it
4000024 in digital a lot of the things youd labor on for hours and hours are done for you
4000025 interior frontiers is a suite of gelatin images that concerns itself with the single photograph
4000026 each image presents internal relationships that are subjective and conceptual rather than objective and formal
4000027 personally i like the fact that shes within a frame she can set up a composition within a frame that speaks in both abstract ways and metaphysical ways
4000028 she is a large part of the reason why we acquired this space
4000029 she was among the original group that started up the original millsaps art district in the late 80s
4000030 i think she had one of her first shows ever in the exact same space years ago
4000031 it was a good way to get in contact with all her friends in jackson her motives and ours are kind of similar
4000032 we want people to see this spot as an artistic center and not just a bad area of town

4000046 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4000047 the one thing he did that was the right move when he first disappeared he went to live rough in cumbria for the first few weeks well away from cctv cameras using cash not using cards
4000048 go to a town youve never been to before find a homeless person and get them to buy a pay as you go phone so youre not caught on cctv
4000049 the other thing is not to have anything to do with places where records are kept so pay by cash or barter and if you have a laptop use it outside places with wi fi access that dont have passwords
4000050 the internet can make a person virtual you can open an ibc international business corporation and operate out of that
4000051 you can use black credit cards that list no transactions have a cell phone billed to anywhere in the world own a virtual fax number that goes to an e mail address and own property under a corporation
4000052 theyre not going to abandon iraq theyre not going to write it off none of that
4000053 but what they certainly may do is start to provide some of those resources that would have come to iraq to pakistan possibly afghanistan
4000054 he offered a mostly upbeat assessment of conditions in iraq just weeks before he is to make a recommendation on whether to further reduce u
4000055 i think the reality of this study is accurate as temperatures do play a great role in stone diseases
4000056 this means that things may not get as bad as we predict
4000057 or it could be that there will be even more cases of kidney stones than our models tell us
4000058 i never came upon any of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking
4000059 falcon hill is not only hills future it represents northern utahs future
4000060 when you look at the long term viability of the air force base this is critical
4000061 were asking these state agencies to monitor the situation within their enforcement powers to make sure utahns are not being taken advantage of
4000062 right now theres a laser like focus on this topic
4000063 if there are any suspicious activities or nefarious intent the information will be forwarded to the attorney generals office
4000064 it makes me mad to see were paying so much above the national average im not saying we have to be the lowest but i expect us to be near the national average not near the top
4000065 his own energy director was on the television the other day explaining that were seeing prices follow the typical pattern for this time of year
4000066 the auditors job is to give an opinion about companies financial statements
4000067 said allen who has taught in the david eccles school of business since 1991
4000068 the ground breaking leader in establishing a model of cooperation between academic researchers and standards setters
4000069 i have high hopes for this cooperation in the future
4000070 we dont believe there is any merit to this lawsuit
4000071 has no merit and we will defend against it vigorously
4000072 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4000073 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4000074 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4000075 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4000076 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4000077 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4000078 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4000079 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4000080 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4000081 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4000082 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4000083 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4000084 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4000085 who are open to doing something on the production side
4000086 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4000087 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4000088 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4000089 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4000090 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4000091 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4000092 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4000093 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4000094 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4000095 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4000096 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4000097 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4000098 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4000099 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4000100 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4000101 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4000102 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4000103 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4000104 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4000105 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4000106 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4000107 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4000108 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4000109 for those who are simply coming because they have an interest and i can understand their interest they wont be eligible for taxpayer funds
4000110 they will be assisted on a very personal basis by a dedicated court support officer who has been designated to work with all of the former patients who have an interest in this case
4000111 we will be working with former patients and making sure that they understand all of the parts of the court process
4000112 the benefits for that end of the cbd is it gets a small park and will calm traffic along eagle st once its finished
4000113 but in the meantime theres absolute urgency to deal with a major pedestrian hot spot at the intersection of queen wharf and eagle streets which has claimed at least one life and critically injured almost 20 people
4000114 people can ignore automated messages on traffic signals but its much harder to ignore a traffic controller particularly if they have the powers of the police
4000115 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4000116 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4000117 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4000118 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4000119 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4000120 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4000121 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4000122 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4000123 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4000124 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4000125 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4000126 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4000127 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4000128 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4000129 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4000130 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4000131 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4000132 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4000133 senator obama had hoped to and had every intention of visiting our troops to express his appreciation and gratitude for their service to our country
4000134 we learned from the pentagon wednesday night that the visit would be viewed instead as a campaign event senator obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a event and decided instead not to go
4000135 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4000136 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4000137 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4000138 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4000139 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4000140 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4000141 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4000142 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4000143 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4000144 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4000145 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4000146 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4000147 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4000148 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4000149 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4000150 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4000151 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4000152 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4000153 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4000154 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4000155 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4000156 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4000157 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4000158 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4000159 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4000160 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4000161 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4000162 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4000163 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4000164 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4000165 you can sense the stimulating effects of caffeine when it binds to receptors in the nervous system
4000166 you cannot feel how quickly your liver is breaking down caffeine in your body and there are no other signs or symptoms that tell you whether or not caffeine can trigger a heart attack in you
4000167 the matter with mayor kilpatrick is dragging down the business and the hopes of the city
4000168 we strongly urge the mayor to step aside and address his problems
4000169 his issues are holding the city hostage detroits future is bigger than the mayor
4000170 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4000171 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4000172 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4000173 we think it is because current drugs cannot reach all of the tuberculosis bacterium in an effective manner
4000174 we know that it kills about 90 percent of the bacteria within the first few weeks of treatment but the remaining 10 percent persists and is very hard to kill as yet we know extremely little about these persistent bacteria but we think we may have now discovered how it might be hiding from the drugs
4000175 infectious disease research is absolutely essential to creating a better understanding of how diseases such as tuberculosis attack the human body
4000176 healthy populations are essential to a healthy sustainable planet through this greater understanding of such diseases we will be able to advance treatments that can someday be the salvation of millions of people worldwide who suffer from devastating illnesses that have enormous personal and societal costs
4000177 colorado state universitys tuberculosis research and dr ormes research program are international leaders in working to find fast and effective cures and preventative measures to help millions of people suffering from tuberculosis
4000178 this grant will help advance important work toward advancing promising discoveries that may help scientists more quickly treat people with this disease
4000179 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4000180 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4000181 its everything its excellent and a relief well be recovering our legs tonight
4000182 were going to work on the simple things like defence and not over calculating
4000183 it feels great my game has changed last year i played in greece and was exposed to a different side of basketball
4000184 ya rasulullah sesungguhnya allah tidak malu terhadap yang haq maka apakah perempuan juga wajib mandi bila mimpi
4000185 apabila kamu memuncratkan air mani maka mandi janabatlah namun manakala kamu tidak memuncratkan keluar tanpa syahwat maka janganlah mandi janabat
4000186 hadits ini mengandung peringatan bahwa air mani yang keluar bukan karena dorongan syahwat misalnya karena sakit atau cuaca sangat dingin maka tidak wajib mandi janabat
4000187 seseorang duduk di antara empat anggota badan isterinya lalu bersungguh sungguh memperlakukannya yaitu jima maka ia wajib mandi sekalipun tidak mengeluarkan air mani
4000188 apabila waktu haidh datang maka tinggalkanlah shalat dan apabila waktu haidh berakhir rnaka mandilah dan shalatlah
4000189 adalah rasulullah saw apabila mandi janabat memulai dengan mencuci kedua tangannya kemudian menuangkan air dengan tangan kanannya ke atas tangan kirinya lalu mencuci kemaluannya kemudian berwudhu sebagaimana wudhunya untuk shalat kemudian mengambil air dengan tangannya lalu memasukkan jari jari tangannya ke pangkal rambut hingga apabila ia melihat sudah tersentuh air semua pangkal rambutnya ia menuangkan air ke atas kepalanya tiga kali tuangan air dengan kedua tapak tangannya kemudian menyiram sekujur tubuhnya lalu membasuh kedua kakinya
4000190 ya rasulullah sesungguhnya aku adalah seorang perempuan yang mengikat kuat rambut kepalaku lalu apakah saya harus membukanya untuk mandi janabat
4000191 tidak harus cukup bagimu menuangkan air di atas kepalamu tiga kali tuangan kemudian engkau siramkan air ke atas badanmu dengan demikian kamu menjadi suci
4000192 hendaklah seorang di antara kamu ambil air beserta daun bidara lalu hendaklah ia bersuci dengan sempurna kemudian tuangkanlah air ke atas kepalanya lalu gosoklah kepalanya dengan sungguh sungguh hingga rata kemudiam tuangkanlah lagi air ke atas kepalanya kemudian ambillah sepotong kain atau kapas maka dengan demikian ia menjadi suci
4000193 wahai rasulullah bagaimana ia dianggap telah suci dengan cara itu
4000194 hendaklah perempuan itu mengambil air lalu bersuci dengan baik atau dengan sempurna kemudian tuangkanlah air ke atas kepalanya lalu gosoklah kepalanya sampai kemudian tuangkanlah air ke atasnya
4000195 dahulu aku sendiri dan rasulullah sering mandi bersama dari satu bak sedangkan kami berdua dalam keadaan junub
4000196 sesungguhnya ummu habibah pernah beristihadhah pada masa rasulullah lalu beliau menyuruhnya mandi setiap kali akan shalat
4000197 telah beristihadhah seorang perempuan pada masa rasulullah lalu ia diperintah oleh beliau menyegerakan ashar dan mengakhirkan zhuhur dengan sekali mandi untuk keduanya mengakhirkan maghrib dan menyegerakan isya dengan sekali mandi untuk keduanya
4000198 rasulullah dalam kondisi kritis beliau bertanya apakah para sahabat telah shalat isya maka kami jawab belum mereka sedang menunggumu ya rasulullah kemudian beliau bersabda sediakanlah satu bak air untukku setelah kami sediakan lalu beliau mandi beberapa saat kemudian dengan susah payah beliau berusaha bangkit lalu pingsan tak lama kemudian beliau siuman sadar dari pingsan lalu bertanya apakah para sahabat sudah shalat isya kami jawab belum mereka menunggumu ya rasulullah kemudian beliau bersabda sediakanlah satu bak air untukku setelah kami sediakan lalu beliau mandi beberapa saat kemudian dengan susah payah beliau berusaha bangkit lalu pingsan tak lama kemudian beliau siuman sadar dan pingsan lalu bertanya apakah para sahabat sudah shalat isya kami jawab belum mereka sedang menunggu ya rasulullah kemudian aisyah bercerita bahwa nabi mengutus kurir memanggil abu bakar untuk ditunjuk sebagai imam shalat isya
4000199 ada seorang laki laki bertanya kepada ali r a tentang mandi

4000208 seseorang yang berperang demi mendapatkan harta rampasan perang dan seseorang yang berperang demi mengejar popularitas dan seseorang yang berperang guna menunjukkan kehebatannya lalu siapakah di antara mereka itu yang di jalan allah
4000209 barangsiapa yang berperang untuk menjadikan kalimat agama allah yang tertinggi maka itulah jihad di jalan allah
4000210 barangsiapa beriman kepada allah dan rasul nya dan menegakkan sholat serta berpuasa ramadhan maka hak allah atasnya untuk memasukkannya ke dalam surga ia berjihad di jalan allah atau duduk di daerah kelahirannya
4000211 sesungguhnya di dalam surga ada seratus derajat yang allah persiapkan untuk orang orang yang berjihad di jalan allah yang jarak antara dua derajat seperti antara langit dengan bumi karena itu bila kalian hendak memohon kepada allah maka mohonlah surga firdaus karena ia adalah surga percontohan dan surga yang paling tinggi derajatnya yang di atasnya terdapat arsy allah yang maha pengasih dan darinya memancarkan mata air sungai sungai di surga
4000212 perumpamaan mujahid di jalan allah seperti perumpamaan orang yang berpuasa lagi menegakkan shalat dengan membaca ayat ayat allah yang panjang ia tidak pernah putus dari puasanya dan tidak pula dari shalatnya hingga sang mujahid di jalan allah itu kembali ke rumahnya
4000213 allah segera memberi pahala kepada orang yang pergi berjihad di jalan nya yang tidak ada yang mendorongnya pergi kecuali karena iman kepada ku dan membenarkan rasul rasul ku dia akan kembalikan ia dengan membawa pahala dan rampasan perang atau akan dia masukkan ia ke dalam surga
4000214 arwah mereka itu berada dalam rongga rongga burung yang hijau ia memiliki banyak lampu gantung yang banyak tangannya yang bergantung pada arsy ia bisa terbang lepas dari surga kapan saja ia mau kemudian ia kembali lagi ke lampu lampu gantung itu kemudian rabb mereka memperhatikan mereka sekali lalu berfirman kepada mereka para arwah itu apakah kalian menginginkan sesuatu jawab mereka apa lagi yang kami inginkan sedangkan kami bisa terbang lepas dari surga sesuka kami dia allah berbuat demikian tiga kali kepada mereka tatkala mereka melihat dari mereka tidak dibiarkan terus ditanya maka mereka berujar ya rabbi kami ingin agar engkau mengembalikan lagi arwah kami kepada jassad kami sehingga kami bisa gugur di jalan mu sekali lagi tatkala dia melihat bahwa mereka tidak mempunyai kebutuhan maka mereka dibiarkan
4000215 ya rasulullah tidaklah engkau menceriterakan kepadaku tentang haritsah dimana ia gugur pada waktu perang badar terkena anak panah yang tidak diketahui siapa pemanahnya jika ia di surga maka saya bersabar namun manakala ia tidak demikian maka saya akan bersungguh sungguh menangisnya
4000216 orang yang gugur sebagai syahid mendapatkan enam keistimewaan pertama ia akan diampuni dosa dosa sejak awal berangkat kedua ia akan melihat tempat duduknya di surga ketiga ia akan diselamatkan dari siksa kubur keempat ia akan terselamatkan dari kepanikan yang luar biasa kelima di atas kepalanya akan dipasang mahkota ketenangan yang terbuat dari yaqut yang lebih baik dari dunia dan seisinya keenam dikawinkan dengan tujuh puluh dua isteri dari bidadari yang bermata jelita dan diberi hak memberi syafaat kepada tujuh puluh dari kerabatnya
4000217 orang yang gugur sebagai syahid tidak akan merasakan pedihnya terbunuh melainkan seperti seorang di antara kamu merasa sakit karena dicubit
4000218 hai orang orang yang beriman apakah sebabnya bila dikatakan kepadamu
4000219 dan belajakanlah harta bendamu di jalan allah dan jangan kamu menjatuhkan dirimu ke dalam kebinasaan dan berbuat baiklah karena sesungguhnya allah menyukai orang orang yang berbuat baik
4000220 ada seorang prajurit dari batalyon mujahirin maju ke daerah pertahanan musuh di qasthanthiniyah konstantinopel hingga badannya tertembus anak panah bersama kami ada abu ayyub al anshari lalu orang orang pada berkomentar ia mencampakkan dirinya ke jurang kebinasaan
4000221 sungguh allah telah memuliakan kami dengan bersahabat dengan nabi nya saw dan dengan menolongnya hingga islam menyebar dan pemeluknya berjumlah besar
4000222 dan belanjakanlah harta bendamu di jalan allah dan janganlah kamu menjatuhkan dirimu ke dalam kebinasaan dan berbuat baiklah karena sesungguhnya allah menyukai orang orang yang berbuat baik
4000223 para perawi sanad riwayat ini dipakai oleh bukhari dan muslim namun keduanya tidak meriwayatkannya
4000224 jika kamu melakukan jual beli secara kredit dengan tambahan harga mengambil ekor ekor sapi sebuah perumpamaan dari rasulullah yang berarti riba atau tambahan dan kamu merasa puas dengan tanamanmu serta kamu meninggalkan jihad niscaya allah akan menimpakkan kehinaan kepadamu yang tidak akan dicabut hingga kamu kembali tunduk patuh kepada agamamu
4000225 telah diwajibkan atas kamu berperang padahal berperang itu adalah sesuatu yang kamu benci boleh jadi kamu membenci sesuatu padahal dia amat baik bagimu dan boleh jadi pula kamu menyukai sesuatu padahal amat buruk bagimu allah mengetahui sedang kamu tidak mengetahui
4000226 tidaklah sama antara mukmin yang duduk yang tidak turut berperang yang tidak mempunyai udzur dengan orang orang yang berjihad di jalan allah dengan harta dan jiwa mereka allah melebihkan orang orang yang berjihad dengan harta dan jiwa mereka atas orang orang yang duduk satu derajat kepada masing masing mereka allah menjanjikan pahala yang baik surga
4000227 allah yang maha tinggi snnjungan nya menjelaskan bahwa para mujahid akan mendapatkan keutamaan dan bahwasanya mereka serta orang orang yang duduk akan mendapat imbalan yang baik kalaulah sekiranya orang orang yang duduk yang tidak ikut berperang itu telah menyia nyiakan kewajiban niscaya mereka akan mendapatkan imbalan yang buruk bukan imbalan yang baik
4000228 akan tetapi satu hal yang seyogyanya kita semua memahami bahwa qital perang dalam islam tidak boleh dimulai sebelum terlebih dahulu ada pengumuman dan takhyir pemberian alternatif yaitu menerima islam atau membayar jizyah upeti atau perang perang didahului dengan pembatalan perjanjian bila mereka pernah mengikat perjanjian dalam kondisi mengkhawatirkan pihak lawan berkhianat ahkam niha iyah hukum hukum yang final menetapkan perjanjian hanya untuk ahludz dzimmah yaitu orang orang yang menerima tawaran damai dari islam dan mau membayar jizyah dan tidak ada perjanjian pada selain kondisi seperti ini kecuali kaum muslimin dalam keadaan lemah yang menjadikan hukum tertentu dalam keadaan lemah ini sebagai hukum marhali hukum periodik yang biasanya diberlakukan dalam keadaan yang menyerupai keadaan di mana sekarang mereka hidup
4000229 berperanglah dengan menyebut nama allah di jalan nya hendaklah kalian menumpas orang orang yang kufur kepada allah berperanglah namun jangan kalian mencuri harta rampasan sebelum dibagi oleh panglima dan jangan pula khianat janganlah kalian mencincang menyayat nyayat bangkai musuh dan jangan pula kalian menebas batang leher anak anak kecil oleh sebab itu manakala kalian berhadapan dengan kubu musuhmu dari kaum musyrikin serulah mereka kepada tiga hal apa saja yang mereka terima dari tiga hal tersebut maka terimalah dan jangan memerangi mereka serulah kepada islam jika mereka menerima ajakanmu terimalah kemauan baik dari mereka itu dan tahanlah dirimu dari mereka kemudian ajaklah mereka berhijrah dari negeri mereka sendiri ke negeri muhajirin dan informasikan kepada mereka bahwa manakala mereka melaksanakan ajakan itu maka mereka akan mendapatkan hak yang diperoleh kaum muhajirin itu dan mereka harus melaksanakan kewajiban sebagaimana yang mesti dilaksanakan oleh kaum muhajirin itu jika mereka tetap enggan berhijrah dari negeri mereka sendiri maka jelaskan kepada mereka bahwa mereka akan diperlakukan seperti orang orang arab muslim yang lain hukum allah swt tetap berlaku atas mereka sebagaimana yang berlaku atas kaum mukmunin namun mereka tidak berhak memperoleh ghanimah yaitu harta rampasan perang yang diperoleh melalui peperangan dan fai yaitu harta rampasan perang yang diperoleh tanpa terjadinya peperangan tanpa ada perlawanan sedikit pun kecuali mereka turut serta berjihad bersama kaum muslimin jika mereka masih menolak tawaran tersebut tuntutlah mereka agar membayar jizyah jika mereka memenuhi tuntutanmu maka terimalah jizyah dari mereka itu dan tahanlah dirimu terhadap mereka jika mereka tetap menolak maka mohonlah pertolongan kepada allah untuk mengalahkan mereka
4000230 didapati seorang perempuan terbunuh di sebagian medan peperangan bersama rasulullah saw lalu beliau melarang membunuh kaum wanita dan anak anak
4000231 sesungguhnya engkau muadz akan datang kepada suatu kaum ahli kitab karena itu ajaklah mereka agar bersaksi bahwa tiada ilah yang paut diibadahi kecuali allah dan bahwasanya aku adalah rasul nya jika mereka dalam hal ini taat kepadamu maka beritahukanlah kepada mereka bahwa allah taala telah memfardhukan atas mereka shalat lima kali sehari semalam jika mereka dalam ini patuh kepadamu maka sampaikan kepada mereka bahwa allah telah memfardhukan atas mereka zakat yang dipungut dari orang orang kaya di antara mereka lalu disalurkan kepada orang orang faqir mereka jika dalam hal ini mereka tunduk kepadamu maka janganlah kamu mengambil harta benda mereka yang berharga dan waspadalah terhadap doa orang yang teraniaya karena sesungguhnya antara doa tersebut dengan allah tidak ada hijab penghalang

4000361 how can all people be expected to believe in allah given their varying backgrounds societies and cultures
4000362 that was in case you mankind should say on the day of resurrection
4000363 certainly it was our ancestors who made partners with allah and we are only their descendants will you then destroy us for what those liars did
4000364 i created my servants in the right religion but devils made them go astray

4000407 wenn man sich diese zahlen vor augen h lt wird klar dass sterreich gefahr l uft sich zu einem berwachungsstaat zu entwickeln
4000408 die initiative platterwatch hat jetzt eine logische nachfolge gefunden denn auch nach dem r cktritt platters geht der ausbau des berwachungsstaats in sterreich ungehemmt weiter
4000409 wir hatten innerhalb von vier monaten ber eine mio zugriffe auf platterwatch at verzeichnet an die 53 000 menschen haben sich die dort eingestellten youtube videos angesehen
4000410 wir konnten aber nicht nur das thema berwachung st rker im ffentlichen bewusstsein verankern sondern auch 25 000 unterschriften f r unsere petition sammeln
4000411 das protokoll dieser sitzung liegt auf unserer webplattform auf daraus geht eindeutig hervor dass der einsatz von sogenannten spitzelboxen bereits diskutiert wird
4000412 es ist zwar zur zeit noch nicht gesagt dass die spitzelboxen f r ungerechtfertigte berwachungszwecke missbraucht werden aber die chancen daf r sind gro

4000422 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4000423 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4000424 i think mccain has to have a running mate that clearly connects with social conservatives in the party
4000425 that is where he is lacking so if he picks a pro choice running mate i dont see how he can win this race
4000426 im not going to say people will stay home but there is a core of voters whose level of enthusiasm influences people further from the core
4000427 so if mccain picks a pro choice running mate the strength of turnout on election day is not going to be there for him
4000428 he walked around an employee walked in and did meet gwatney
4000429 they introduced themselves at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times he then turned and left the business

4000449 the president should emphasize that a normative prohibition on targeting non combatants and increased cooperation with other states in the international system are the goals of us counterterrorism strategy
4000450 though this should not be mentioned in the speech the next president must also recognize that 9 11 was a long shot and that it should not be cause for further restriction of freedoms or invasions

4000474 it has been a good year and tonight is the culmination of a long period of preparations it was possible by the hard wok and desire to win by the boys and no doubt the support by the aiff the boys deserve to win
4000475 it was a good team effort there were also some good individual efforts it was one of those performances in which a determined group of players almost finished the game in the first 25 minutes against a strong opponent
4000476 i said there were good individual performances and chhetri was one of them he is a remarkable player and future star for india he scored indias lone goal against myanmar in the semi final and another three today in the last 100 minutes he has scored four goals that is fantastic

4000487 the members of the security council emphasised the importance of the unity of all lebanese people they also reiterated their full support for all ongoing efforts in lebanon to combat terrorism
4000488 they are facing charges of incitement to racial hatred or complicity in incitement they will answer these charges in court

4000491 we were keen to support the event because of what the co op and others are doing in relation to seafood policy because its bringing about a change in fishing policy
4000492 they are investing money in trying to promote fisheries which might want to apply for certification from the marine stewardship council but perhaps didnt have enough funds to do it themselves
4000493 ive been working in this area for about 17 years and in the last three years ive seen an incredibly positive change in the behaviour of fisheries in the uk
4000494 ultimately what it depends upon is fishermen changing the bad practices from the past such as throwing fish back over the side and retailers paying a premium for quality products
4000495 its the first bright news for traders in the oil market in a while
4000496 the dramatic drop off in commodities and specifically oil has been well overdone in my view
4000497 they still think the u s is the epicenter of the world economy
4000498 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india

4000506 it is what chelsea and peter kenyon want but there is no way that will pay what madrid want
4000507 the money madrid are asking for is exaggerated in todays market
4000508 it is fair to say that is what is holding it up
4000509 it is continuing hopefully not for as long as the speculation about frank lampard linked with inter milan before agreeing a new five year contract
4000510 weve still got a few days left of the window so hopefully well get a result
4000511 hes definitely commanding the ball better repeating his delivery and hes throwing harder
4000512 he had a lot of action on the baseball he was on top of his game tonight
4000513 thats the first time i havent seen him in the same uniform as me its the same jeremy ive seen my whole life we had some chances he just made tough pitches
4000514 im still trying to be consistent in the strike zone and get ahead of hitters
4000515 we were one pitch away from keeping it a one run game
4000516 you always feel like if you can keep it to one run you have a chance
4000517 its something we talked about when we were going through it with cc its the business of baseball
4000518 there are going to be years when you have a lot adversity i think our guys have learned a great deal about how to handle that
4000519 theres always going to be people going up and down people that you have personal relationships with people get traded or people are released or get injured and weve had a little bit of all of it i think they learned a great deal about what they have to do to make sure this game doesnt beat you down
4000520 in two of the three years ive been here theres been a lot of people leaving and obviously weve already lost a lot of guys this year
4000521 each one is extremely important to this team paul in particular i probably had the most defined relationship with he helped me out a whole lot
4000522 its always tough to lose someone you look up to and respect to a very high degree
4000523 we wanted to get a look at zach we traded for him and we like him aaron we thought it would be good for him to stay down there and keep doing what hes doing

4000526 weve learnt to be careful in our public utterances as a celebrity one has to be careful one cant sit around being offended by the public attention
4000527 the policy is unique not only in india but also in the world it will cover hospitalisation expenses as a result of opportunistic diseases acquired by the hiv person
4000528 the policy does not cover any treatment for hiv like anti retro viral therapy art but would only cover illness acquired by such person because their immune system becomes weak
4000529 we wanted the policy to remain as cost effective as possible for those persons had these two also been included the premium would have gone up
4000530 the message from investors to corporates is that if we are headed for a recession they should clean up their balance sheets and prepare a financial buffer
4000531 as banks de lever nonfinancial corporates will have to wake up to far less flexible world of credit
4000532 the market appears to have overreacted to a fall in the oil price and investors have turned a blind eye to second round effects of inflation such as rising wages
4000533 it will take several months of slowing global growth to be sure that the inflationary dragon has been slain
4000534 while we have started to see some demand for oil curtailed in oecd economies the economic fundamentals in china and other emerging markets support oil at more than u s 100 a barrel into 2009
4000535 banks are highly unlikely to see a v shaped recovery in their share price given the uncertainties in the market
4000536 apart from the economic outlook a key question is how stringent regulators will be in setting new rules to govern banks capital ratios no one yet knows what the appropriate capital structure of the future is

4000548 apparently the little girl whose voice was used yang peiyi wasnt cute enough it was deemed bad for chinas image to show a little girl with crooked teeth
4000549 china wants the olympics as a stage to present a picture perfect image to the outside world and perfection was clearly the goal for the dazzling opening ceremonies
4000550 eager to put on a perfect olympics beijing has swept its streets of fake designer handbags pirated dvds and phony corporate logos that dedication to authenticity apparently does not extend to olympics ceremonies

4000561 if they pay they get reimbursed so at the end they dont pay a dime
4000562 theres a lot more on their mind than to have to worry or try to remember to get a hundred dollars reimbursed to them when they get into a war zone
4000563 if your stuff is over the weight limit you will be charged but all that money is put on a government travel card which is a credit card and you get money from the government to pay for it my bags cost me an extra 150 to take to afghanistan because it was over the weight limit when i filed my travel voucher i was given 200 to cover that cost because i added an extra 50 that i said i tipped a person to help with the bags we file claims over here bruh the news better get it right

4000577 albany n y in certain precincts of a world encouraged to embrace differences christ is out
4000578 the terms b c and a d have clear catholic roots dionysius exiguus an abbot in rome devised them as a way to determine the date for easter for pope st john i the terms were continued under the gregorian calendar created in 1582 under pope gregory xiii
4000579 when jews or muslims have to put christ in the middle of our calendar thats difficult for us
4000580 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
4000581 the sole purpose of any play should be to change the entire world thats it because if everyone in the world sees your play and understands it then everything in the world should change you shouldnt shoot for anything less than that
4000582 we still have a lot of hurdles to go over but im encouraged
4000583 i know this has been a hardship on them for that i apologize
4000584 but this project will put sugar house back on the map
4000585 our goal is to keep the roads functioning and then do what we can
4000586 were not 100 percent sure but we do believe this is ms nichi edwards
4000587 hes trying to deal with this the best he can
4000588 she was feeling a lot of pain at the time
4000589 when he arrived he tried to go back into the house and found the bedroom engulfed in smoke
4000590 she would play in the yard with her nephews and they went to church most sundays
4000591 its not difficult to see from the data and i know the east side transition team will disagree on these numbers that the remaining school district for west jordan will absolutely be in a diminished financial position
4000592 not only are they held harmless theyre held harmless at a level higher than comparable districts serving two thirds of the students
4000593 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
4000594 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
4000595 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
4000596 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
4000597 he is a dreamboat if i were that age and single id be in so much trouble
4000598 i said youd be exactly my type he liked it he was like that would be great i was of course teasing but of course not teasing
4000599 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
4000600 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
4000601 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
4000602 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
4000603 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
4000604 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
4000605 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
4000606 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
4000607 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
4000608 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
4000609 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
4000610 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
4000611 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
4000612 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
4000613 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
4000614 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
4000615 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
4000616 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
4000617 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
4000618 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
4000619 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
4000620 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
4000621 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
4000622 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
4000623 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
4000624 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist
4000625 when i was growing up i had a pretty difficult time
4000626 i just found when i was introducing myself to people it was a little awkward
4000627 you get all those wee wee jokes and that sort of thing
4000628 he e mailed me right away and said holy sh the nintendo is named after you
4000629 the reason my parents chose that is because they didnt really have a name picked out when my mom was pregnant
4000630 i thought it was weird nintendo would go with that
4000631 now when i meet people i say my name is wii
4000632 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
4000633 its actually been really fun weve been listening to our ipods and i slept for a lot of the time weve been just keeping each other busy
4000634 it seems like time goes by so slow because im so excited
4000635 i really like spending time with my kids theyre really good girls and the jonas brothers are just awesome theyre darlings
4000636 its kind of cool to be a part of it its good to see people so excited about a band
4000637 i want you to sing this with me as loud as you can
4000638 aggressive driving and speed related issues are a bigger problem in utah even though duis seem to receive more media attention
4000639 we always need to combat drunken driving for our state it would be good to see more work to solve the aggressive driving and speed related issues as well as drowsy and distracted driving
4000640 were growing by a city the size of spanish fork population 28 000 every year in utah county
4000641 ik schat het werkelijke aantal nieuwe kerken ergens tussen de 300 en 500 dat vind ik verrassend veel zeker als je kijkt naar het dalende kerkbezoek
4000642 meestal geven gemeentestichters aan dat ze een nieuwe kerk starten om niet christenen duidelijk te maken dat het geloof de moeite waard is hartstikke mooi wat mij betreft maar ik denk wel dat het belangrijk is dat nieuwe kerken naar hun omgeving gaan luisteren voor ze aan de slag gaan alleen als je goed luistert en daar wat goeds mee doet kan je echt bij het hart van mensen komen
4000643 well apparently within the framework of well prepared plan several hundred pieces of russian equipment russian airborne troops commanded by head of airborne troops of russia certain with the rank of general landed there and expelled and certainly killed part of the population the whole population from that place is gone this is classical case of ethnic cleansing
4000644 what i least want is for somebody to take advantage of the image of manfred to bring about a confrontation between members of cochabamba residents thats why today i am letting the secretary general of the prefecture to continue this work while i conduct the pertinent legal affairs and while i show that the decree of the electoral court was harmful to justice in bolivia
4000645 told me that he will kill me and chop my body into pieces
4000646 its so awesome it gets three smileys in a row how awesome is that lol hehe
4000647 troubled by the claims in the book and that his staff would
4000648 i have no knowledge not that i want to have knowledge not that i dug to find knowledge i have no knowledge
4000649 non ce nest pas bien une pingouine sans son commentaire

4000652 je vais me faire une petite r trospective de sa filmo
4000653 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
4000654 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
4000655 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
4000656 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
4000657 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
4000658 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
4000659 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
4000660 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers
4000661 pemerintah pun tidak boleh intervensi di indosat apalagi pemerintah luar
4000662 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing
4000663 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to
4000664 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4000665 id love to if i can find the right movie
4000666 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
4000667 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4000668 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
4000669 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4000670 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
4000671 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
4000672 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
4000673 who are you how many hit records do you have
4000674 back in college when me and my roommates would get hammered and rap along to victory id yell to no one in particular that this was one of the 10 greatest hip hop songs of all time while clutching a quart of mickeys ice in one hand and a half eaten totinos party pizza in the other well just so you know heres a partial list of other things i thought were pretty great back then drunk driving self immolation ramen noodles the wwf phishs billy breathes and the career prospects of florida gators qb jesse palmer a k a the guy who ended up on the bachelor
4000675 when you go to eat at a stuckeys family restaurant and one of the girls from dream is your server do you tip her 20 percent or just the standard 15
4000676 carlitos way rise to power is perhaps the finest direct to dvd prequel to a substandard brian de palma al pacino gangster flick that also stars mario van peebles and that guy who played maurice tt rodriguez in boogie nights to be released this decade or at least in the past five years
4000677 how many lives were lost during your tragic vote or die campaign in 2004 when will your savage thirst for blood be slaked
4000678 what have i ever done what have you ever done aside from you know launching a multimillion dollar media empire lording over a hugely successful clothing line shaping the career of perhaps the greatest mc of all time scoring a series of hits as both a producer and a solo artist and running in the new york city marathon on a whim actually wait never mind
4000679 your skin is way smoother than i wouldve imagined given the amount of times i have seen your proactiv commercial
4000680 in tons how many magick talismans ancient tomes aleister crowley artifacts did it take to convince jimmy page to appear in the video for that god awful song you did on the godzilla soundtrack
4000681 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag
4000682 thank you for not beating me with a champagne bottle or a telephone receiver
4000683 a couple of months ago we werent sure that if kerri got into a jam shed be able to bang her way out of it
4000684 but today she really swung away and hit a couple of balls really hard
4000685 its such a big weapon for her she likes to just bang her way out of a pickle and she did that today
4000686 the shoulder takes a little time to wake up sometimes
4000687 but it seems like the more it hurts the better i play
4000688 now we she and charpantidis are getting picky working on this little thing here or there but i have the feeling now that if i feel something in the shoulder im just able to push my way through it
4000689 i was so bummed out in april may june misty and troy kept saying look its not about june and july its about august
4000690 now that im here im where i want to be thank goodness
4000691 i dont understand young people nowadays anyway so ill leave it to ayaya and nino you can change the lines too just play the roles the way you want and teach me how kids nowadays think
4000692 well the women would come up and say something about how nice my wife looked or how pretty her dress was so id nod my head in agreement
4000693 they all wanted to know if the mule was for sale
4000694 when the only fraud alleged is that the defendant was not sincere when it promised to perform under the contract
4000695 a t the time d efendants made the alleged representations regarding the short and long term compensation plans d efendants did not intend to compensate plaintiff in conformity with their promises
4000696 d efendants did not intend to compensate plaintiff in conformity with the promises and assurances concerning the short and long term compensation plans
4000697 g eneral allegations that defendant s entered into a contract while lacking the intent to perform it the allegations are insufficient to support the fraud based claim s
4000698 to place the nonbreaching party in as good a position as it would have been had the contract been performed
4000699 s ince the actual defamatory words were never pleaded with particularity but were only paraphrased in a manner such that the actual words were not evident from the face of the complaint the long standing rule is that dismissal is required
4000700 the deceleration in export growth was the main reason for the slowdown in industrial output
4000701 a rise in enterprise production costs have also impacted industrial output
4000702 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates
4000703 we set out to bring inflation back within a target range and are confident we are on that path
4000704 you have the perfect storm of conditions at os west the trees are older and people are right among them
4000705 we generally only remove weak trees that are both in peril of falling and will likely hit a person or property when they go a dead or damaged standing tree still plays an important role in the forest as a place for birds to nest for example this is also why we try to leave trees on the ground when they fall in a natural area
4000706 it is good dna theyve survived the test of time they are open pollinated which i think is very important i guess im old fashioned girl and an old fashioned gardener
4000707 i think there is an increased demand for growing organic and it is something we are hoping we can do
4000708 once the farm gets going i think this is a viable way of producing vegetables also we are just getting the fields and the soil established and that is the key

4000779 as for the reaction here its always pretty much the same in these cases
4000780 people get defensive and dont understand what the big fuss is all about which i can understand in this case because there was no ill will intended
4000781 that wasnt the case with the incidents at the bernabeu game and the f1 circuit which were flat out embarrassing
4000782 people here dont appreciate being singled out as especially racist i dont have any numbers to support it but i would bet the farm that proportionally there are more interracial marriages and couples with men and women from different countries here than in most nations around spain yes we do have a problem with racism but just like everybody else
4000783 our studies also show that the eye contact between two persons and an averted gaze affect the functions of the neural mechanisms that regulate approach and avoidance behaviour another persons direct gaze prepares for an approach an averted gaze for avoidance
4000784 the deviations related to eye contact in people with autism are one of the earliest and most typical problems and our studies make it possible to find out why people with autistic behaviour avoid eye contact
4000785 our findings have long term implications for how we teach negotiation
4000786 men who try to make a positive impression by being conciliatory risk forfeiting their own economic outcomes and women who try to make positive impressions by being assertive can risk damaging their relationships thus men and women may benefit from different strategies when it comes to balancing the tension in negotiation between empathy and assertiveness

4000790 weve also got a young crop of riders waiting in the wings
4000791 weve identified track as an important area of cycling for us to develop in
4000792 its being said that its a little hot here so the final decision will be made after the 10 000
4000793 you never know they might mess around and never make the final
4000794 last year everybody had me paste for a bronze medal
4000795 and i came in there and i did what i had to do and i got the silver
4000796 i feel like this year i have not run up to par how i did last year
4000797 it has been up and down im just trying to get back to where i was
4000798 its all going to boil down to who can handle the pressure and who is tough enough
4000799 my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
4000800 at the 80 metres mark i was hurting but i told myself hang on hang on i did what my coach told me dont panic
4000801 even in the last five metres i knew it was very tight and that i wouldnt win until i had my hand on the wall i already had a race where someone got there just before me i didnt want it to happen again
4000802 my first thought was thats it ive won the final it is so hard to believe
4000803 i took it to heart i was the last guy and it was on my shoulder
4000804 he deserves a lot of the credit this win is a credit to his professionalism and hard work
4000805 i never felt lost i wanted first place i didnt know if i would break the record i just wanted to win the race it was won in the last five metres
4000806 a trenchant critique of the brutal economic and racial repression of his society
4000807 makes reference to violence police repression guantanamo bay defecation and marijuana
4000808 i couldnt tell if it was cool or creepy for obama to have
4000809 its easy to knock mccain for being old but i love meeting old people who know about music
4000810 listening to dancing queen alone too many times though would be suspicious
4000811 mccain has a really likeable list then again hitler liked some good music you know
4000812 i never would equate any living human being with hitler
4000813 relative differences the myth of 1 june 29 2007 but even these figures are only measuring about 2 of our total genetic makeup that is those genes that code for proteins the building blocks of our physical bodies and functions
4000814 i dont think there is any way to calculate a number percentage of similarity in the end its a political and social and cultural thing about how we see our differences
4000815 you will be astonished to know about the activities of dr afia
4000816 we know that you are connected to higher ups but do not make an issue out of your daughters disappearance
4000817 i call her the grey lady because she is almost a ghost a spectre whose cries and screams continues to haunt those who heard her
4000818 she rented a post office box to help a former resident of baltimore named majid khan alleged al qaeda suspect to help establish his us identity
4000819 we know that you are connected to higher ups but do not make an issue out of her daughters disappearance
4000820 i think everyone was shocked to hear that the americans were holding this woman at bagram in afghanistan from the information coming through i am told she is being held in exactly the same conditions as the men and has absolutely no privacy when it comes to toilet and shower facilities
4000821 this would never happen to a western woman and it shows just how women are viewed by the us military there is even a suggestion she has been mo lested and se x ually abused by her captors we need to demand the truth
4000822 i was released on humanitarian grounds mercifully my treatment was good respectful and decent although still terrifying
4000823 i remembered moazzam telling me about the womans screams and how he first imagined they could be from his wife in truth i thought maybe he had just been listening to a tape recorder as part of a form of mental torture
4000824 however we now know the screams came from a woman who has been held in bagram for some years and without compromising anyone we can also reveal from impeccable sources that her prison number is 650
4000825 this information has been enough to scramble the pakistan media into action by demanding the return of this woman to her homeland immediately
4000826 prisoner 650 is just the tip of a very nasty iceberg of human rights abuses illegal detentions and rendition flights it is a shameful episode in pakistans history which must be put right
4000827 i wonder how can we hand over our sister to the non muslims for their illegal trial by men whose history is full of rape and other abuses to prisoners
4000828 i began to hear the chilling screams of a woman next door why have you got a woman next door they told me there was no woman but i was unconvinced those screams echoed through my worst nightmares for a long time and i later learned in guantanamo from other prisoners that they had heard the screams too
4000829 while on the run one not only confirmed he had heard a womans screams but said he had seen her
4000830 my story made international headlines front page pictures and major stories on tv but there has not been one word not one paragraph about prisoner 650 the grey lady of bagram a murderous detention facility under control of the u s military and intelligence services
4000831 all like the grey lady of bagram have been illegally abducted by secretive intelligence agencies they began disappearing in 2001 during the so called war on terror
4000832 my goal with this book is to give witness to the mighty works of god in my life i want to give glory and honor to him in all that i say and do i also think of the many women i have met throughout my career who have fallen away from the church these women are in my heart as i write this book because i want to take their hand and walk them home to rome and of course i write this book so that all can be reminded of the graces and mercy of god
4000833 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
4000834 two commonly held views on the question of when a pregnancy begins
4000835 49 percent of americans believe that human life begins at conception
4000836 dismissing medical experts and opting instead to accept a definition of pregnancy based on polling data
4000837 at some biologically unknowable moment theres no test to determine if a womans egg has been fertilized under these new standards there would be no way for a woman to prove shes not pregnant thus any woman could be denied contraception under hhs new science
4000838 up to its old tricks again quietly putting ideology before science and womens health we cant let them get away with this underhanded move to undermine womens health and thats why i am sounding the alarm
4000839 concerns for non violence sustainable development justice and peace and care for our environment are of vital importance for humanity
4000840 understood apart from a profound reflection upon the innate dignity of every human life from conception to natural death a dignity conferred by god himself and thus inviolable
4000841 let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beings and especially the young who are so exposed to temptation need incentives to keep the moral law and it is an evil thing to make it easy for them to break that law another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman and disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection
4000842 you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
4000843 it would be very difficult to pull this information together
4000844 brendas last published study using this data set was released in 2000 after she moved to her present facility in 1995
4000845 immediately after that publication one of my colleagues requested a break down of details which had only been superficially summarized in one her tables one of her grad students replied on her behalf with the additional summary statistics we had requested within 48 hours so it clearly wasnt at all difficult for her team to access the data plus with modern electronic data bases and multiple backup procedures in place at universities like hers it is nearly impossible to lose such data
4000846 i know of a number of experts in the field who have requested the data even within the last six months but she simply doesnt respond to their calls emails or letters
4000847 this is very troubling on two counts first the apas own ethics rule 8 14 requires research psychologists to share their data for verification of findings secondly she is the chair of the apa abortion task force which is at least in theory supposed to bring full and clear light to this issue but how can we trust the objectivity of a report prepared by a task force composed exclusively of pro choice psychologists especially when the chair and lead author has a history of withholding data and findings which may undermine her ideological preferences
4000848 there is no doubt that she has selectively reported her findings
4000849 we have seen in the unpublished tables details about specific negative reactions which were obscured in her published report by combining them with three to eight other reactions to create watered down composite scores
4000850 in my view it is irresponsible not to report the significant findings associated with individual symptoms for example she found that a number of women reported that they tried to cope with negative feelings about their abortions by drinking more or taking drugs but she has never not fully shared the details on these reactions in any of her published studies and by refusing to share her data for reanalysis by others she has prevented anyone else from reporting these findings either
4000851 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
4000852 even the modifier that there is no credible evidence of mental health risks in the ideal case of a low risk abortion patient is an admission that there is indeed some evidence that a single abortion can pose a risk to the mental health of a emotionally stable adult woman
4000853 in fact the report itself identifies a whole host of studies providing such evidence but it mutes a clear presentation of the findings of these studies by focusing on the limitations of each studys methodology which all studies have in order to justify ignoring their clear implications
4000854 by failing to call on therapists to be alert and sensitive to the negative emotional experiences women attribute to their abortions the task force has allowed ideology to trump sensitivity
4000855 instead they are ignoring the reality of how and why abortions take place and are instead focused on drawing conclusions regarding the safety of abortion for an emotionally stable pro choice adult woman who is freely choosing a wanted abortion without any moral qualms but that doesnt reflect the reality of most abortion situations
4000856 the fact is that coerced abortions are more common than wanted abortions studies show that over 60 of american women are having abortions often against their moral beliefs because they feel pressured into it by third parties these women need therapist and family members to be open to and responsive to their pain not dismissive of it as an anomaly sadly this is an ideological report that simply ignores the concerns and needs of those women for whom abortion has been a heartache rather than a triumph
4000857 no one is in a jam more than leah daughtry the religious point person for the democrats and ceo of the convention
4000858 to begin with the democratic convention is not starting with a religious service it is being held on august 24 the day before the convention begins it is still not clear whether clergy will be allowed to wear religious garb but the venue has been decided according to the
4000859 the coalition says the meeting excludes nontheistic democrats and is divisive rather than unifying
4000860 eluded arrest so long by shaving his swoopy gray hair and disguising himself as a serbian orthodox priest he reportedly hid out in caves in the mountains of eastern bosnia and in monasteries
4000861 it was not true to say that the serbian church was hiding him it appears that he was living right there in clear view practicing alternative forms of medicine in front of everybody
4000862 was not in a distant monastery or a dark cave when caught at last but living in serbias capital
4000863 its like that old saying that you cant fight city hall
4000864 want to link all of this to the serbian orthodox church and they want to say that all serbs everywhere are guilty of the actions of these violent men and that most of all the serbs are the only people who have ever done these terrible things to their neighbors
4000865 they forget that men like karadzic and slobodan milosevic were enemies of the church and used violence against the orthodox too our bishops were jailed and beaten for opposing the regime behind this violence
4000866 way of non violence and cooperation is the only way blessed by god in agreement with human and divine moral law and experience
4000867 even as evil cannot be overcome by evil so peace and harmony cannot be attained by war
4000868 to be a peacemaker is the greatest duty and most noble obligation of every man that is why we are not afraid to be the first to extend the hand of peace to one another
4000869 we hear accusations against orthodox people but we never seem to hear who what when and where
4000870 if its true we need to know facts but it is wrong for the media to keep making vague accusations against our whole church in this way which only makes things worse for those who have endured so much
4000871 believe that the misunderstood sage of nazareth was a figure so riveting inspiring charismatic and mesmerizing that he galvanized a movement of deeply devoted disciples into the energetic process of ignoring everything he said and did utterly forgetting his unforgettable oratory and replacing it with reams of quotations having the precise historical value of a fever dream
4000872 this is my body an evangelical discovers the real presence
4000873 behold your mother an evangelical discovers the blessed virgin mary
4000874 entered the building shooting at people who were praying killing or injuring many of them
4000875 fled without rushing down barranco azul avenue where there was a group of soldiers and ministerial police who did nothing to detain them the statement said
4000876 andrew is absolutely thrilled with his debut album but it is a huge personal blow to him that prince has declined the use of purple rain
4000877 it is disappointing that the track that got him signed and was loved by the record company could jeopardise the album release so it had to be removed
4000878 i have the utmost respect for prince without purple rain i wouldnt be where i am today
4000879 for those who are simply coming because they have an interest and i can understand their interest they wont be eligible for taxpayer funds
4000880 they will be assisted on a very personal basis by a dedicated court support officer who has been designated to work with all of the former patients who have an interest in this case
4000881 we will be working with former patients and making sure that they understand all of the parts of the court process
4000882 i expect that the police will do their job as well as they have been to date on this matter
4000883 the public can rely on our queensland police to keep a very close eye on mr ferguson
4000884 i think it is really a reward for the trade union leaders whove supported us and members who had to make substantial commitments to the future
4000885 they made big decisions in the 80s and 90s which i think has stood the nation in good stead really
4000886 and its a recognition of their contribution rather than me personally
4000887 you dont strive for recognition when you join something like the police force but the recognition is nice and i think it says a lot for the people ive been able to work with
4000888 he did it all for his electorate and he believed that was his role to represent his constituents and i think he did that in a very honourable and efficient way
4000889 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
4000890 yeah we disenfranchised black voters in florida and ohio but we had to be in the white house for 8 years to achieve our vision for a new america no disrespect intended towards those african n egro american peoples sic of color they must understand we were ordered to do this by god if the coloreds could only have voted republican they would have never had trouble placing their ballads sic
4000891 earlier in the day the president acted very strange what appeared to be at times a strong disconnect from reality and now he had to give a live press conference on national tv in less than 20 minutes laura and chief of staff andy card were frantically searching for him throughout the white house living quarters they walked in the master bathroom and there he was sitting in the tub playing with his rubber duckies and watching the cartoon channel on a portable tv they were running an old heckle and jeckle cartoon the funny thing is he said is that the one bird speaks with an english accent and the other bird speaks with a brooklyn accent kinda like tony blair and mario cuomo the president then laughed loudly and quite hysterically for 5 minutes
4000892 the undeniable fact is that this is the most heinous conspiracy ever committed by americas traitorous enemies on the left
4000893 wir blicken auf ein schwieriges zweites quartal zur ck in dem unsere anstrengungen zur ergebnisverbesserung durch weitere kostensteigerungen in laufenden langfristprojekten integrationsma nahmen in k rzlich erworbenen gruppenfirmen sowie die verz gerung von bedeutenden projektvergaben zunichte gemacht worden sind
4000894 wir haben im ersten halbjahr 2008 mehrere neue kunden akquiriert darunter mit panda security auch einen internationalen gro kunden der innerhalb europas eines der wachstumsst rksten softwareunternehmen ist und ein entsprechend hohes umsatzpotential im online handel bietet
4000895 die solide steigerung unseres umsatzes die wir trotz dollarschw che und gebremster konjunktur erzielt haben stimmt uns f r das zweite halbjahr zuversichtlich in dem wir weitere abschl sse mit internationalen kunden erwarten

4000897 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
4000898 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
4000899 if georgia fails it will send a message to everyone that this path doesnt work
4000900 meet me at the quad in 5 a non sequitur overheard on the subway or flirty banter with that cute guy you met at the party last weekend texting is easy efficient and most importantly it frees the sender of the commitment and formality of a full phone call
4000901 the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of american journalism
4000902 everything on the huffington post is linked and attributed when i read that paragraph i thought rosen was talking apples to oranges
4000903 the fight currently ongoing between major newspapers and the ap over what the businessmen like to call repackaging content and what other people call stealing
4000904 i subscribe to new york observer reporter tom scoccas definition of plagiarism
4000905 and that is in short form what does this guy have that that guy didnt have already see how i didnt plagiarize there by giving tom his due credit
4000906 theres no way i could wake up every morning and find all of that myself that quickly
4000907 well i dont have too much to say on the subject
4000908 you see plagiarism of ideas without credit all the time in internetland on a daily basis
4000909 its an easy thing to commit too particularly when youre writing a blog and youre tasked with producing a certain amount of what they call content
4000910 right now what i see a lot of is people linking less and less prominently to their source material sometimes its just tiredness and distractedness lord knows i know but its bad for the internet and its bad for all of us
4000911 why cant we have an internet where stories and sources are linked and even named prominently
4000912 i link to things in my column that i get from all over
4000913 theres a huge and obvious difference between fair use blockquoting some text and giving a link and a name credit and unethical reprinting
4000914 this is common practice in newspapers from not only a hundred years ago
4000915 what site lead or managing editor of a website has time to send out a memo saying this is how we attribute stories and this is the theory behind it and its a good thing few if any
4000916 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
4000917 it was a little chaotic but they wanted chaos it was about one third drummers and two thirds people who knew how to play drums
4000918 energy is the most important issue moving forward to ensure the future competitiveness of the united states
4000919 boons pickens approach would involve doing more drilling but i think we need a more comprehensive approach
4000920 we need a real underlying change in foreign and domestic policy
4000921 we have the skilled employees we need today but are not sure about the ones we need tomorrow
4000922 we really have an opportunity to own a dialogue that has a lot of people like boone pickens and al gore taking high profile roles
4000923 we are obviously the organization with the best ideas now we just need to communicate them effectively through social and offline media
4000924 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4000925 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4000926 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4000927 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4000928 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4000929 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4000930 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4000931 already at the time the facade devastated by bullets became one of the symbols of the august 21 1968 occupation

4000940 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4000941 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4000942 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4000943 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4000944 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4000945 thats one small step for man one giant leap for mankind eh
4000946 ill never have a chance of winning the presidency unless i sober up eh
4000947 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4000948 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4000949 oil company profits shown to reduce dependence on foreign oil

4000964 for the third time today its reminiscent of those pictures weve all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well placed dynamite to knock it down
4000965 i respect the question i respect it enough to say that to give a short brief answer would be wrong basically that is is not that good for me but i was reporting live at 9 11 and i reported what i saw and tried to describe it as accurately as i know how
4000966 well im always interested in turning up new information but i would be honest with you to say that uh i have my doubts of what that investigation would turn up as different but if theres a new investigation i certainly would follow it
4000967 now it can be said openly and loudly that the reigning malaca ang occupant avidly wants to continue wielding power and might
4000968 never mind the thousands of people displaced and impoverished hurt or killed on condition only that someones tenure of power and might is extended as long as possible
4000969 we have line up a series of activities including a regatta with 200 rowers out to rescue our symbol of integrity
4000970 from the babaylan to our muslim brothers and other faiths
4000971 resource persons have been invited to talk about issues from the environmental degradation at rapu rapu in albay province to the effects of evat and the latest developments at the commission on audit
4000972 there will be a litany of untruths from 12 00 midnight as concerned artists will make an image of judas stuffed with firecrackers to cap the event
4000973 there will be a lugawan where people from all walks of like will be treated to traditional evening snacks
4000974 yes they are welcome to listen to the speakers and take part in the activities because the invitation is for all filipinos
4000975 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
4000976 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
4000977 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
4000978 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
4000979 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
4000980 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
4000981 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
4000982 i cant eat that m amp m i dont eat any milk products i only eat soy and tofu even though it fucks paraguay
4000983 youd better catch that pigeon and get it back to the nurse
4000984 el problema de la gente mayor en este pa s es que no tiene ni idea de lo que es el amor mucho menos de lo que ese concepto significa ahora el valor del sexo fuera de la procreaci n es ciencia ficci n para ellos afortunadamente eso est cambiando

4000987 i understand that you want to cry right now but outward emotion would be both improper and embarrassing for you
4000988 friend it is critical that you complete this fourth and final step of the program
4000989 it is imperative that you cut off all contact with the female for no less than two weeks

4001207 for me coming here was a sense of getting involved with a club that has the same vision as i have i want to be the best i can be and my aim for the team is the same
4001208 i am making no predictions the only promise i make is to do whatever it takes in terms of work in making leicester tigers successful

4001217 if adults or siblings are giving our children access to facebook then it is a concern more widely

4001247 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
4001248 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
4001249 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners
4001250 we will try and play our natural game against him and see

4001253 im so sick of meyer and her psychotic devotees trying to force us to like a book that shouldnt have made it past the publishers whats fueling my anger now is the arrogence sic she has towards it its ok sm if you screwed up on the quality you are only human but admit that we might be on to something dont try to shut us up or make it seem like were the stupid ones thats insulting to our point of view im tired of sm and her fans trying to tell us how were supposed to feel about the book we hate it thats our g dda n right forgive us for understanding the minimum quality that should be expected from a publishable book

4001260 we have been talking to paul since june and have allowed him to speak to other clubs
4001261 obviously i would love to be part of the one dayers right now because i feel it would enhance my development
4001262 just the sheer one day game you have to add a slightly different thinking to your cricket
4001263 but i am going back to northants playing as much cricket as i can and looking forward to developing other areas of my game which excites me
4001264 i am looking forward to playing for northants until the end of the season
4001265 it definitely excites everyone because of the context of the game what its about
4001266 if you drop a catch you could lose everything if you take the catch you get everything its pretty black and white so its quite exciting
4001267 i think twenty20 is exciting it adds another dimension to cricket and more importantly i think it is getting more people involved in the game
4001268 there are spectators out there who might not have been interested in cricket its catching more people and more youngsters are getting involved in the game
4001269 thats probably the more important side more people are getting involved and that has a positive impact
4001270 there were areas in the inner cities where violence has forced individuals within a 30 square feet radius to remain there for years they cannot go up the lane down the lane or anywhere else because of violence the end result is this heart breaking situation

4001276 nimu is clearly becoming an important copper district following our drill success over the past two months central china goldfields has in total interests in seven exploration licences each of which shows evidence of copper porphyry mineralisation the work we are currently doing is focused on a small area within one of the seven licences gangjiang within gangjiang we have now identified four potential centres of mineralisation which appear to sit within a broader body of lower grade copper mineralisation the results of holes gj07 to gj14 have confirmed the southeastern copper rich centre at guqing mineralisation there is near surface and has been detected across an area of approximately 460 metres long up to 150 metres wide and up to 250 metres deep the near surface portion of this has significant amounts of oxide copper present we are now testing the second area east nading 900 metres to the north of guqing last year in this area we identified copper mineralisation in hole gj02 announced 30 august 2007 in light of what we learnt we have re analysed this hole and confirmed that the top 44 7 metres from 11 metres down hole returned circa 0 5 copper equivalent this particular section is hosted within the favourable quartz monzonite where strong mineralisation was identified elsewhere in nimu hole gj15 was drilled with the aim of confirming mineralisation in the east nading area the assays are pending

4001290 dit gebied libanon syri de westelijke jordaanoever jordani bestond zestig jaar geleden voor 15 tot 20 procent uit christenen nu is dat minder dan 5 procent
4001291 christenen hebben vaak familie in het buitenland dat maakt hun vertrek gemakkelijker
4001292 ik schat dat 6 tot 7 zeven procent van de palestijnen in 1948 christen was het percentage christenen in jordani bedroeg in dat jaar 5 procent nu zal dat nog 3 procent zijn er vertrekken overigens ook moslims de emigratie van christenen valt echter meer op want die groep is klein maar christenen vertrekken niet als gevolg van problemen met moslims echt niet
4001293 het vormt echter slechts een reactie op provocaties amerika en isra l zijn de agressors religieuze fanatici zien de oorlog van bush als een soort nieuwe kruistocht hezbollah is door isra lisch geweld ontstaan
4001294 zulke agressie zorgt voor spanningen en emigratie niet de islam
4001295 in 1948 kwamen 800 000 palestijnen ons land binnen de isra lis dwongen hen hun gebied te verlaten
4001296 er leven nu ongeveer 2 miljoen palestijnen in jordani dat heeft een negatief effect op de economie van het land
4001297 palestijnse vluchtelingen uit de jaren 1948 en 1967 veroorzaken problemen in jordani ze willen isra l bevechten doorgaans zijn het arbeiders zonder veel scholing extreem fundamentalistische moslims zijn vaak uit die groep afkomstig zij sympathiseren niet zelden met hamas
4001298 of met het islamic action front de grootste oppositiepartij in jordani
4001299 de islam als godsdienst houdt niet van christenen en een enkele keer komt het voor dat iemand een baan niet krijgt omdat hij christen is
4001300 van wantrouwen tussen moslims en christenen hoeft op het platteland geen sprake te zijn maar als moslims aan de weet komen dat een van hen is gedoopt ontstaan er spanningen
4001301 voor 1948 waren er ettelijke totaal christelijke dorpen en steden door de vluchtelingen veranderde dat
4001302 christenen raken er steeds meer in de minderheid ze leven in vrede samen met moslims zolang ze het niet over godsdienst hebben maar als het over een baan gaat geven sommige werkgevers de voorkeur aan een niet christen
4001303 maar wel als zij de wet overtreden jordani zal nooit mensen uitzetten vanwege de religie maar christenen mogen moslims niet op straat proberen te overtuigen van hun geloof of trachten te bekeren ik ben er zelfs niet gelukkig mee als een christen vertelt dat hij moslim wordt hoewel ik ervan overtuigd ben dat de koran als de laatste openbaring superieur is ook mogen samenkomsten van christenen in woonhuizen niet uitgroeien tot een geheim genootschap elke vergadering moet in overeenstemming zijn met de wet
4001304 de autoriteiten spreken niet de waarheid als zij zeggen dat ze niemand om hun geloof het land uit zetten
4001305 een predikant in akaba is afkomstig uit egypte maar is getrouwd met een jordaanse vrouw hij werkte al dertig jaar in jordani hij moest weg een dominee in zarka die al 23 jaar als predikant werkt hebben ze gevangengezet
4001306 ik weet van meer dan tien mensen dat zij het afgelopen anderhalf jaar het land zijn uitgezet wegens als missionair betitelde acties dat is veel in een land waarin christenen een minderheid vormen ik hoorde van een lijst van tientallen christelijke organisaties en kerken die gesloten zouden moeten worden maar dat moet je eerst checken onze regering heeft spionnen in dienst dat is goed voor de veiligheid maar als christenen binnen de kerk als spion fungeren gaat dat te ver
4001307 vijf jaar geleden zijn wij een afdeling van onze bijbelschool in jordani gestart in juni 2007 begonnen jordaanse autoriteiten ons te ondervragen nu is de bijbelschool gesloten
4001308 binnen de regering groeit de invloed van extreme moslims nog even en zij nemen de macht over
4001309 velen komen met dergelijke bedoelingen in de naam van onze democratie en vrijheid jordani binnen en beginnen met een huisgemeente ze proberen andere christenen te bekeren zij vissen in andermans netten wij hebben met onze oecumenische kerken geen problemen met het krijgen van toestemming voor kerkbouw wij stelen ook geen moslims of christenen dat leidt tot conflicten wij moeten moslims niet leren dat wij als christenen superieur zijn wij mogen ook niet zeggen dat zij naar de hel gaan
4001310 de orthodoxen de rooms katholieken en de andere geregistreerde kerken dus ook de lutherse gr hebben de regering een brief geschreven met het dringende verzoek de andere niet geregistreerde protestanten niet toe te staan de reden is waarschijnlijk dat die vrije kerken waar de bijbel nog echt opengaat mensen wegtrekken bij de offici le kerken vandaan
4001311 christenen vertellen de koning leugens over de protestanten en hij zegt doe wat je wilt
4001312 de regering weet dat evangelisatie leidt tot een krachtiger manifestatie van hamas dat leidt dan weer tot emigratie
4001313 ze gaan niet weg uit politieke of religieuze motieven kijk maar waar ze heen gaan velen trekken naar de arabische golfstaten
4001314 die egyptenaar die akaba uitgezet is ken ik persoonlijk ook wel maar dat is geen religieus conflict hij zal wel geprobeerd hebben anderen tot het christendom te bekeren
4001315 de laatste decennia zijn tal van mensen om het geloof naar het westen ge migreerd zon 65 procent van de jordani rs heeft palestijnse wortels zij beschouwen christenen als mensen die steun betuigen aan isra l mensen gaan het land niet uit vanwege moordpartijen maar om economische redenen en ook vanwege de sociale druk want de verhouding tussen moslims en christenen levert wel spanning op
4001316 maar ook om het systematisch vertrek van christenen te ontmoedigen hun aantal wordt kleiner maar ze zijn wel een deel van onze geschiedenis onze cultuur en beschaving daarom moeten ze blijven
4001317 misschien wat onderhuidse gevoelens maar die zijn er in elk gezin er is geen ongelijkheid tussen moslims en christenen er zitten veel christenen in de organen van de overheid
4001318 ik ben christen maar mijn cultuur is de islam de muziek in de kerk is wel mooi
4001319 de meeste moslims die christen willen worden doen dat in het geheim ik zal hen nooit dopen want dan zorg ik ervoor dat zij zouden kunnen worden gedood ze zijn welkom in de kerk het heilig avondmaal kan ik hun ook niet bedienen in plaats van conflicten wil ik vertrouwen cre ren en bouwen aan de vrede
4001320 ik heb geen idee hoeveel het er zijn ik denk dat het gaat om kleine groepen in woonhuizen mensen in de geregistreerde kerken willen hen meestal niet hebben
4001321 de regering is goed voor christenen maar als een predikant een voormalige moslim wil dopen is dat gevaarlijk voor hem want dat trekt geweld van extreme moslims
4001322 thats okay i will patiently wait i am okay wiuth being lonely for now

4001340 everything we do is whats best for the team if the closer is available why wouldnt you use him if the situation dictates the game needs to be closed out why wouldnt you
4001341 mentally you prepare to come in with a one run lead and the adrenaline is way different
4001342 youre ready for the game then all of a sudden you score some runs and you have to shut it down you get upset because youre so competitive and you want to come in the game its frustrating but its something you cant control as long as were winning im fine with it

4001344 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients here we found a mutation that affects only the eyes suggesting that this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
4001345 the new information that the nphp4 gene can be involved in eye diseases only can shed light on the etiology of some low frequency eye diseases in people where similar mutations may be involved
4001346 our findings show that single neurons from one primary sensory cortex can integrate information from another sensory modality
4001347 our results argue against a strict hierarchical model of sensory integration in the brain and that integration of multiple senses should be added to the list of functions of the primary visual cortex
4001348 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
4001349 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
4001350 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimer s disease pathology and may appear before memory loss

4001352 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
4001353 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf

4001356 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
4001357 this could be what underlies addiction dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
4001358 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
4001359 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
4001360 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake

4001373 any attempt by him to dislodge the government using his authority under article 58 2b of the constitution will plunge the country into yet another election the results of which are unlikely to differ greatly from the february 18 poll he can also reach out to his hand picked supreme court to halt the impeachment process on technical grounds but given the prevailing public opinion the supreme court will be hesitant to oblige him

4001376 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
4001377 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
4001378 he walked around an employee walked in and did meet gwatney
4001379 they introduced themselves at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times he then turned and left the business
4001380 they were often personal outpourings some were written as poetry and some cast him as one of his own poetic characters
4001381 some writers even sent him their own work while others spoke of their own circumstances and how they felt much better for writing to byron many of them were furtive and embarrassed and said can you burn this letter as soon as you have read it
4001382 the fact that he kept them suggests he really did care what people thought and although he struck a pose of aloofness he appears to have treasured these letters
4001383 i suppose in my life i have received at least 200 anonymous letters aye 300 of love literature advice abuse menace or consolation upon all topics and in every shape
4001384 the fact that byron kept the letters is important he was absolutely fascinated by his own reception and the way he was perceived he even mingled his poetry with his own self creation he pretended not to care about his reader while at the same time making huge efforts to keep track of what his readers thought about him
4001385 i congratulate michael on his monumental achievement after spending time with him i found him to be a great guy and great for the olympics i had my time and i will forever cherish not only my accomplishments but the entire olympic experience as a whole however records are made to be broken we are now in a new millennium a new era for the olympic games china has already shown that with their sensational opening ceremony which has set a new standard for the olympics of this era i am pleased that someone like michael phelps is leading the way and i look forward to seeing more great things to come
4001386 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4001387 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4001388 i think mccain has to have a running mate that clearly connects with social conservatives in the party
4001389 that is where he is lacking so if he picks a pro choice running mate i dont see how he can win this race
4001390 im not going to say people will stay home but there is a core of voters whose level of enthusiasm influences people further from the core
4001391 so if mccain picks a pro choice running mate the strength of turnout on election day is not going to be there for him
4001392 ive already won the battle as far as overcoming this disease and basically meeting my goals while knowing that i have cancer
4001393 i was really upset and i got angry when i was diagnosed
4001394 and i had a choice it could either hurt me or help me and i made sure it helped me
4001395 i went up to him and i said you know what
4001396 one of the things ive learned with my mom having it twice my grandmother having it my dad having it the last thing the person wants is for you to treat them like they cant do things for them themselves
4001397 its one of those things where you wake up and you have choices to make every day and i can chose to let it control my life or i can chose to not and im choosing to live the way i want to and do the things that i want to do
4001398 cancer of the testicle is a very curable cancer with cure rate well over 90 percent when its caught in the early stage
4001399 because a tumor in the testicle isnt going to spread quickly to the other organs this is one of those times in your life when you weigh the timing of your surgery with the timing of the major events in your life and its ok to put off the surgery for a little while in favor of a major event like the olympics

4001403 winning the medal would be like icing on the cake for my swimming career
4001404 im up there representing basically the cancer community and hopefully showing people that there is a fight to do this you dont have to be afraid of it you dont have to let this disease control your life

4001409 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
4001410 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future
4001411 his most productive days in the nba were just a few short years ago when he had rashard lewis on the other wing
4001412 here you say you have richard jefferson on another wing youre putting luke ridnour in the best possible position to be successful again as he has been in the past
4001413 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
4001414 we understand that its a unique opportunity here specifically but weve got to do the best thing for our basketball team and we feel like the best thing for our basketball team is to add some toughness and some intangibles defensively for us at that position

4001420 i dont think it would be too much of a leap to say that you have the same sorts of problems with violence in pregnancy in australia
4001421 three quarters of the women who experienced violence during the pregnancy had also experienced violence from the partner prior to the pregnancy as well
4001422 it could be that if you are in a violent situation you are less likely to be sure that you want to have a baby

4001427 canada remains steadfast in our commitment to the people of afghanistan and will continue to work with the afghan government and the international community to improve the lives of afghans

4001461 hes the greatest olympian in the world and hell be able to earn money everywhere as hes an international brand
4001462 hes a billion dollar man he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
4001463 in the heat and intensity of this event it may seem that his earning power is limitless but you have to pull back and look at someone like tiger woods who has performed at a top level for years and years in front of the world
4001464 the olympics is only held once every four years after a year to so americans forget about the olympics and move to stars they see more kids want someone else on their weetabix box
4001465 you need to be out there early and establish your affiliation with the property michael phelps
4001466 his performance here will benefit us as it will add to the visibility we will get through this affiliation and his earning ability will increase theres no question of that
4001467 in the short term he is a gold mine because he represents everything that is pure young strong and visionary about america we havent had anyone of this significance since mark spitz
4001468 guaranteed there will be marketers wanting a piece of him that make no sense and it will interesting to see how his handlers cope with this and if they get greedy because the olympics has a narrow avenue of marketability

4001506 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
4001507 the most important thing is being able to separate the two events and just move on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me in the psychological part
4001508 what a great way to finish with a gold medal and a world record
4001509 for us to break the record by so far is amazing i really look back to sitting back and cheering for the aussies
4001510 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
4001511 it definitely gives me more motivation im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
4001512 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
4001513 its a new generation and its now time to step aside they did a great job im from the previous generation
4001514 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
4001515 so to go out there and accomplish a medal is really exciting it doesnt top the relay medal but its something ive been pushing for for years
4001516 i am canceling my membership today as i have successfully completed all of my clep amp dsst testing activities
4001517 i signed up for your service and started studying on thursday morning of this week for the clep principles of management course that was yesterday i took the exam today at texas tech and scored in the 97th percentile i needed a score of 56 to receive credit at my university and i got a score of 75 not too shabby thanks for the great program
4001518 this website is a great resource its far better and easier than any other methods im looking into books and plain tests with no explanations
4001519 as a senior in college i was going to be 3 credits short of my requirements for graduation so i decided to give instantcert a shot after only a few times logging on to the site and answering the questions i felt fully prepared when i took the actual clep exam the nominal fee to join saved me hundreds in tuition dollars and hours of valuable time
4001520 just thought i would drop you a line to let you know i passed the intro to sociology clep exam and it is due to your great service i have never taken any previous sociology classes and to be honest i felt uneasy relying solely on your site to get me through it not only did i pass it i kicked its i hope the other 27 credits go this easily
4001521 just wanted to let you know that i subscribed to instantcert com and used the site to study for 3 dsst exams that i took within a 30 day timespan i didnt have time to read the books closely but with the help of instantcert com i scored high enough to receive credit for each exam

4001535 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4001536 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4001537 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4001538 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4001539 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4001540 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4001541 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4001542 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4001543 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4001544 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4001545 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4001546 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4001547 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4001548 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4001549 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4001550 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4001551 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4001552 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4001553 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4001554 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4001555 its the first bright news for traders in the oil market in a while
4001556 the dramatic drop off in commodities and specifically oil has been well overdone in my view
4001557 they still think the u s is the epicenter of the world economy
4001558 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india
4001559 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympic games

4001567 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4001568 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4001569 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4001570 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4001571 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4001572 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4001573 i think they knew that history was being made tonight obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
4001574 they did a good job of calling timeouts or substituting when there was a free throw usually on a free throw we get the ball and take off and run they did a good job of offensive rebounding too
4001575 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4001576 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4001577 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4001578 it indicates that early eating patterns have effects that persist over time regardless of later changes in diet
4001579 so it is very important for children to eat a well balanced diet from an early age if they are to get the best out of their education
4001580 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4001581 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4001582 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4001583 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4001584 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4001585 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4001586 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4001587 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4001588 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4001589 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4001590 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4001591 if you dont think it would happen in real life why would you believe it in an email

4001603 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4001604 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4001605 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4001606 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4001607 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4001608 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4001609 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4001610 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4001611 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4001612 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4001613 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4001614 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4001615 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4001616 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4001617 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4001618 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4001619 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4001620 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4001621 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo

4001625 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4001626 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4001627 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4001628 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4001629 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4001630 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4001631 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4001632 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4001633 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4001634 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4001635 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4001636 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4001637 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4001638 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4001639 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4001640 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4001641 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4001643 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4001644 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4001645 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4001646 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4001647 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4001648 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4001649 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4001650 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4001651 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4001652 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4001653 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4001654 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4001655 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4001656 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4001657 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4001658 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4001659 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4001660 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4001661 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4001662 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4001663 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4001664 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4001665 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4001666 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4001667 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

4001689 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4001690 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
4001691 the interest is not here its not showing up in polls
4001692 what do you say to that crowd that will resonate to the people of virginia
4001693 i am excited about this chance to showcase some of the initiatives we launched here in virginia and the results we achieved in our effort to help people compete in a changing economy
4001694 barack obamas natural base is not the business community yet probably there is no democrat more respected by american business leadership than mark warner
4001695 a lot of us including me supported mark because we did not like the direction the state republican party was headed
4001696 that what was done by the tga was out of malice out of vengeance and out of vendetta
4001697 im personally not aware of any other case in this country where the government has accepted a claim against it for abuse of public office and paid such a large amount to a private individual
4001698 what it means is the government has thrown in the towel and accepted responsibility for what happened to pan
4001699 they are a good team and they just made better offensive plays than us we could have beaten them if we had played better

4001708 no one hunting for life would be happy to see it in any sort of abundance
4001709 it is not a molecule of choice for most life
4001710 in my opinion the chances that the supreme court will agree with the appellate division are extremely high
4001711 we conclude that the residency restriction ordinances conflict with the policies and operational effect of the statewide scheme implemented by megans law which was intended both expressly and impliedly to be exclusive in the field
4001712 the subject matter reflects a need for statewide uniformity the ordinances interferewith and frustrate the purposes and operation of the statewide scheme
4001713 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empowers people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs

4002044 i never had breasts like these even before my kids i had 3 pregnancies and the saggy breasts to prove it you cant imagine how sexy it feels to have actual cleavage now my husband says i definately dont look like anybodys mother anymore
4002045 hes won a lot of medals and stuff and i thought that makes me really want to go to the olympics and try my best to get there
4002046 it helps people fulfill their dreams if you want to really swim and when you see him it makes you feel like maybe someday you can break a world record
4002047 hes just a regular person and so it makes other people think they can be just as good as he is if they practice like he does

4002059 mccain has a good record on that issue abortion and he must show that he will continue it as president
4002060 for mccain the aim will be to solidify evangelicals as a key constituency
4002061 for obama it is significant that he will be participating as an equal on the same stage as mccain in an evangelical church this signals the shift in the evangelical political landscape since 2004
4002062 this has a lot less to do with what is going on in california and more to do with what is going on in ohio pennsylvania and florida the big swing states
4002063 in all of these states there is a sizable evangelical population that does not directly identify with the old religious right

4002069 what i saw in 2006 is that we won on the last day
4002070 we had a celebration from winning the wild card a week before that and we had a celebration on sunday the final day of the regular season
4002071 we didnt come down from that high we were still up there and maybe we celebrated too much but in three games we were out of the playoffs we were never in tune
4002072 some guys had days off and they rested we worked on what we needed to work on for the playoffs we had playoff at bats during the season
4002073 you try to train yourself for that week or two weeks and have playoff at bats you might not get a hit but you always try to get 3 2 counts if you can
4002074 i think itll be good to clinch at least a week early and that way you can get a day or two off crack jokes relax your mind or whatever
4002075 get your mind on what you need to focus on you can focus on your ultimate goal which is the ring
4002076 this team right here has a lot of veterans theyre the core guys and then you have some younger guys around but they went through that losing in the playoffs last year theyre not going to let that happen again

4002084 big browns camps recent remarks about curlin inspired me to offer an incentive to get these two great horses to race at the legendary track at the spa
4002085 i dont understand the point of it charity is from the heart not to make a horse race out of it
4002086 our plan has been the breeders cup classic all along
4002087 meet us there and get the charities involved then we laid out our schedule earlier when curlin was still looking at going to france i shouldnt have to chase him we should meet in the race everyone points for and thats the breeders cup classic
4002088 i spoke with trainer saeed bin suroor yesterday and faxed them the form on both races and they are still looking i think they want to make sure they run something entering music note in the alabama and then scratching is a possibility anything can happen after they draw
4002089 they would have two chances to win the alabama which is obviously a classic race while the travers is well the travers i think the concern is the big field if the travers were under six or seven they might be a little more gung ho about it

4002096 health and human services officials are considering a draft regulation that would classify most birth control pills the plan b emergency contraceptive and intrauterine devices as forms of abortion because they prevent the development of fertilized eggs into fetuses the rule which does not require congressional approval would allow health care workers who object to abortion on moral or religious grounds to refuse to counsel women on their birth control options or supply contraceptives it would forbid more than half a million health agencies nationwide that receive federal funds from requiring employees to provide such services pharmacists could use the rule as a justification for refusing to fill birth control prescriptions and insurance companies could cite it as a basis for declining to cover the costs

4002099 domestic violence a societal imperfection with no place in a perfect religion
4002100 domestic violence within the muslim community is difficult to quantify due to under reporting it would not surprise me if non muslim physicians over estimate it and muslim physicians under estimate it neither is doing any good for the victims or the image of islam

4002102 we are conscious of the need to reduce waste and operate a sustainable business as well as manage our costs the installation of these machines has reduced our solder usage this not only reduces our environmental footprint but also helps us manage our production costs in the light of recent increases in the cost of solder especially lead free solder
4002103 lead free solder is about four times more expensive than the leaded equivalent due to the higher silver content so the economics are particularly compelling in our rohs compliant process
4002104 its definitely not on the front page of the sports section

4002127 any attempt by him to dislodge the government using his authority under article 58 2b of the constitution will plunge the country into yet another election the results of which are unlikely to differ greatly from the february 18 poll he can also reach out to his hand picked supreme court to halt the impeachment process on technical grounds but given the prevailing public opinion the supreme court will be hesitant to oblige him

4002129 they were often personal outpourings some were written as poetry and some cast him as one of his own poetic characters
4002130 some writers even sent him their own work while others spoke of their own circumstances and how they felt much better for writing to byron many of them were furtive and embarrassed and said can you burn this letter as soon as you have read it
4002131 the fact that he kept them suggests he really did care what people thought and although he struck a pose of aloofness he appears to have treasured these letters

4002176 this industry operates in cycles and were at a down cycle mr mcinnes said in a teleconference today

4002178 we ensured that each key component of our business was prepared for a soft retail environment
4002179 we have really three different flounders here in n c
4002180 but summer and southern are the ones commonly encountered by anglers the gulf flounder is the third and although they have some different life history aspects its their differences in distribution that affects their management
4002181 geographically summer flounder or fluke as they are also known are found from as far north as nova scotia on down to northeast florida
4002182 summer flounder tend to prefer the higher salinity water and are often found in the eastern sounds particularly the inlets and in the ocean but southern flounder are found in the water salinity range from pure fresh to seawater all throughout the estuaries
4002183 the summer flounder are managed through the atlantic states marine fisheries commission and the mid atlantic fisheries management council who have the federal waters jurisdiction
4002184 we have an annual quota or target for summer flounder and we exceeded that target as a result of some really good fishing in july and august for some reason
4002185 every state except virginia and massachusetts exceeded their quota last year it was a really good fishing year
4002186 for north carolina last year we had a recreational quota of 137 000 fish
4002187 and this year its 115 000 last year we landed around 174 000 fish so were required to take a minimum of 34 percent reduction for 2008
4002188 we look at size limits creel limits and season closures for 2008 we have a 15 1 2 inch minimum size limit an eight fish creel limit and no closed seasons in the ocean and eastern estuaries however western albemarle and pamlico sounds and the estuarine and ocean waters south of browns inlet will be exempt from these regulations mainly because there are only a very few summer flounder caught there and in those areas it will remain a 14 inch minimum size limit and an eight fish creel limit with no closed season
4002189 both sides agreed to redeploy the troops who are stationed in the pagoda near the temple to the lowest possible number in order to avoid confrontation with each other

4002196 what has happened today i believe is a landmark in australian legal history
4002197 the settlement involves a judgment for the claimant mr selim but does not involve the commonwealth conceding any of the specific allegations in the proceedings
4002198 i think that mr selims actions and the events of today have now opened the door for other people to now seek compensation from the government
4002199 i believe there will be a great number of shareholders and significant number of customers of pan and service providers who will now be looking to the government to be compensated
4002200 it has come at a great personal cost which cannot be fully compensated by any agreed amount of damages

4002203 any idea of what your kid is doing right now
4002204 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things mr tanner told abc radio
4002205 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
4002206 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
4002207 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility mr tanner said
4002208 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
4002209 now i see my future going somewhere i just can t wait to be at medical school

4002254 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
4002255 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
4002256 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
4002257 so many people are being hurt by these high gas prices and it just caught america by surprise they just werent ready for these adjustments that need to be made
4002258 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions

4002282 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
4002283 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
4002284 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
4002285 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
4002286 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
4002287 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
4002288 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
4002289 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
4002290 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand

4002296 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet

4002543 mccain has a good record on that issue abortion and he must show that he will continue it as president

4002552 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past

4002565 i will pay you as so far i am concerned your company and the way it is run is appalling and i jsut want to get rid of you
4002566 in all my working i am 63 years old of age inever had to write a formal letter of complaint the gross arrogance and ineptitude demonstrated by your organization leaves me in awe of its ability to trade at all

4002712 there is a problem with the proxy servers security certificate
4002713 it opened our eyes as coaches so im kind of glad that happened
4002714 i would like for people to try and exploit things in the preseason i think that helps us
4002715 its something that were probably going to see a whole lot more of this year
4002716 guys will roll out and try to stay away from the front four
4002717 i think a lot of that rests on the defensive coordinator
4002718 he has to find a way to put us in position to make the plays were supposed to make if teams are doing one thing you have to find a way to counter thats what hes done for us
4002719 obviously with the success we had last year with the pass rush of this football team thats something were going to have to combat
4002720 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media

4002724 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
4002725 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
4002726 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
4002727 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
4002728 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
4002729 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
4002730 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
4002731 they basically have said that there is a lot of concern
4002732 people are very passionate about this issue and they realize that it is a problem for them and theyre going to try to do their best to alleviate those concerns

4002770 you only have to look at the steel deals and see that the indians have been quite acquisitive

4002786 at this time the price of crude oil in the world market has fallen and there is good hope for us to reduce the fuel pump prices how much we will reduce depends on the reduction of the market price i cant say how much will be reduced
4002787 we are weighing all the possibilities we have said previously that we would review the prices on a monthly basis and we will make the appropriate announcement on september 1 it will be based on the average of world oil prices taken for the whole month of august
4002788 the more the price of crude oil in the world market goes down the better we will also maintain the 30 sen subsidy that we had announced earlier

4002792 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4002793 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4002794 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4002795 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4002796 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4002797 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4002798 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4002805 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

4002807 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4002909 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4002910 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4002911 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4002912 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4002913 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4002914 share how obamas policies have been directly shaped by the people he has met as he traveled the country

4002916 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4002917 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4002927 a faulty fuel flow regulator was replaced overnight and the flight to los angeles is due to depart this thursday afternoon
4002928 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
4002929 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself
4002930 and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
4002931 i think planning whats going to happen next year or this autumn is going to happen after this week right now all im thinking about is how am i going to play good this week how am i maybe going to possibly win this
4002932 im not going to think about the future right now
4002933 i kind of feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win

4002935 i never used the r word that gave me an opening but i dont have a timeframe i have a lot on my plate and im excited about the next chapter
4002936 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4002937 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
4002938 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbours that what it thinks about us policy
4002939 i was suspicious when i first heard this story because it came from infowars
4002940 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4002941 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4002942 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
4002943 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
4002944 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
4002945 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
4002946 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
4002947 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
4002948 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
4002949 ive been a student of national media marketing design for almost 20 years now
4002950 and i cant say ive ever been more excited than now our new director ossie whitmer promises to bring things to a much higher level and increase our output i realize this will mean more national media marketing design hours but this also means more money for all of us
4002951 because as interest and corporate demand for national media marketing art grows so will the talent base were going to see some great work from some of the top up and coming names in the business
4002952 we look at the work of others not because we want to copy it
4002953 but because we want to take away the best aspects of each national media marketing design and apply them to our own work
4002954 this means a lot to me personally weve worked so hard in this industry for years and finally it is starting to pay off big
4002955 i know there is no such thing as a quick buck but in 5 years when this national media marketing industry blossoms were going to see a lot of new rich people
4002956 the use of computers in our firm has accounted for a five fold increase in productivity quality and sales volume computers allow our national media marketing design specialists a much a higher degree of efficieny and output furthermore since we can make more with less our overhead decreases dramatically and profits will skyrocket
4002957 the fact that most of todays up and coming designers have never used charcoal and a pad of paper doesnt bother me in the least
4002958 the key to working on good national media marketing design pieces is patience and rote talent
4002959 like many of our employees i started with classical art training and drawing and slowly moved into the post modern area this succession greatly improved my national media marketing art and drawing skills
4002960 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
4002961 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options
4002962 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4002963 there is no doubt in our mind that he knew we were coming to get him
4002964 unfortunately mr fontanez decided not to go peacefully and it turned violent
4002965 my kid was a good kid they didnt have to kill him
4002966 they had him down so whyd they have to shoot him i dont understand
4002967 it makes no sense they could have waited for arraignment to set bail or take him into custody
4002968 all i can say is there was a valid arrest warrant and we made the decision to pick him up
4002969 i cant tell you exactly how that determination was made
4002970 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4002971 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4002972 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4002973 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4002974 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4002975 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4002976 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4002977 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4002978 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it

4002982 empty condom packet amp a photo of the tarts knickers
4002983 the next item that will probably be sold on ebay at a start price of 99c and of course with no reserve
4002984 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
4002985 ebay does connect colourful buyers with colourful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
4002986 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
4002987 i see no reason why the court shouldnt act in accordance with the wishes of the parties
4002988 what has happened today i believe is a landmark in australian legal history
4002989 the settlement involves a judgment for the claimant mr selim but does not involve the commonwealth conceding any of the specific allegations in the proceedings
4002990 i think that mr selims actions and the events of today have now opened the door for other people to now seek compensation from the government
4002991 i believe there will be a great number of shareholders and significant number of customers of pan and service providers who will now be looking to the government to be compensated
4002992 it has come at a great personal cost which cannot be fully compensated by any agreed amount of damages
4002993 pay no attention to those overprivileged banks behind the curtain the ones interest from the economy in exchange for the nothing out of which they create the money they loan look only at those being quietly and systematically fleeced and defrauded by a system set up by and for bankers and pretend that its all their fault that this is being done to them
4002994 buying land is better than renting because when you buy you build equity for yourself when you rent you build equity for someone else
4002995 ok has this stood up in court what cases what was the argument used
4002996 but the reality is that this is the one tax that economists throughout history have generally agreed cannot be passed on
4002997 there just isnt enough to take remedial steps we dont only want to look after victims we want to prevent these kinds of incidents
4002998 it is over these incidents that the board will strictly apply amendments to the film and publications act and take steps against mxit if necessary
4002999 any material that could be damaging or traumatic to children
4003000 there is obviously a serious misconception over how mxit works and where the responsibility lies it is impossible to monitor all traffic on the network
4003001 and i need you everybody needs someone like you if you need me too you will be the only thing i take on my great escape
4003002 i am now recognising in both the one dayers and the tests i am one of the more senior players and that i need to go out and play like that
4003003 its an exciting thing for me to be seen as one of the senior players and to go out there and have a responsibility to deliver its a role im looking forward to having for a while to try to lead by example
4003004 its something i want to do as i have played enough test matches i have made a switch in the batting order from five to three and there is an opportunity to cement my place
4003005 it has been like that in the one dayers for a while and it is something i have enjoyed and i have been able to be very vocal in team meetings
4003006 hopefully it will be the same in the test matches and my performances against south africa the form team in world cricket show i have improved this summer i am desperate for that to continue
4003007 the ability is in the dressing room to win the ashes i dont think anyone would doubt that
4003008 the one thing we need to do as a side which we havent done too well is to be consistent
4003009 we scored almost 600 at lords and then followed that up by scoring 200 twice in the first innings of the next two tests
4003010 unfortunately lukes knee blew up afterwards was worse again this morning and the scan has then revealed the bad news
4003011 we need a government that transfers power to the elected representatives of the people to carry out the peoples mandate for change
4003012 our people continue to face a profound humanitarian crisis this destructive policy of banning humanitarian assistance can be reversed with one letter
4003013 tragically zimbabwe has become one of the worst man made humanitarian disasters of a new and hopeful century
4003014 because of the failed policies of zanu pf five million zimbabweans now face starvation and famine we cannot allow this to happen
4003015 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
4003016 there is no way you can extract a bilateral agreement from a tripartite process
4003017 the leaders of our political parties must rise up to the challenge to provide leadership
4003018 why do we see a difference between the objects hitting the ground and the big objects whizzing by
4003019 we finally had a big enough data set that the statistics demanded an answer it could no longer be just a coincidence
4003020 we think the yarkovsky effect is so efficient for meter size objects that it can operate on all regions of the asteroid belt
4003021 odds are an object we might have to deal with would be like an ll chondrite and thanks to our samples in the laboratory we can measure its properties in detail
4003022 good golly gosh you shouldnt be getting your panties in a twist
4003023 this activity is not related to either our geoeye 1 satellite or to the boosters readiness the geoeye 1 spacecraft has successfully completed all of its pre launch checkouts prior to being mated to the booster which is now expected to happen the third week of august
4003024 they were past their end of life the motors were worn from years of use and regular rebuilds and the inefficient motor generators were failing frequently
4003025 losing mhr for any period of time would impact our ability to track in this region

4003028 we are extremely pleased to host another launch by up aerospace which continues to set the precedent for safe practical commercial spaceflight at spaceport america

4003035 water as we know it does not exist within our bodies
4003036 water in our bodies has different physical properties from ordinary bulk water because of the presence of proteins and other biomolecules proteins change the properties of water to perform particular tasks in different parts of our cells
4003037 while it is well known that water plays an important role in the folding process we usually only look at the motion of the protein
4003038 this is the first time weve been able to look at the motion of water molecules during the folding process
4003039 water can be viewed as a designer fluid in living cells
4003040 our experiments showed that the volume of active water was about the same size as that of the protein
4003041 we previously thought proteins would affect only those water molecules directly stuck to them
4003042 now we know proteins will affect a volume of water comparable to their own thats pretty amazing

4003084 we had always planned that the end of the series would involve noah returning because he was so central as a new character at the very beginning an entering character growing up in the er so we pulled out those old notes and came out with a lot of new things

4003138 e una persona seria per lui parlano i risultati che a mio avviso sono stati strabilianti un allenatore va giudicato alla fine di un campionato e non volta per volta e soprattutto dopo esibizioni non proprio brillanti della propria squadra
4003139 gli acquisti dello scorso anno sono stati centrati tutti in pieno gargano hamsik e lavezzi sono giocatori di grande prospettiva che hanno fatto vedere di essere gi pronti per il campionato pi difficile del mondo cio la nostra serie a gli acquisti di questanno sono estramamente interessanti se si dovessero affermare in maglia azzurra la squadra veramente sarebbe in grado di ambire ad un piazzamento a ridosso delle grandi maggio stato il colpo pi importante a genova ha acquisito una certa maturit ed esperienza a napoli potrebbe trovare lazzurro della nazionale per il resto sono affascinato dalle potenzialit di russotto giocatore che ho avuto modo di vedere allopera con il mio pisa nello scorso campionato tecnicamente mostruoso palla al piede ti punta e ti salta con la naturalezza dei grandi fantasisti spero che a napoli gli venga dato il modo di crescere con tranquillit e non caricato di eccessive responsabilit un diamante grezzo che va tutelato
4003140 il napoli di oggi certamente di gran lunga superiore a quello che dovetti gestire io dopo lo tszunami del fallimento forse questo lunico rammarico della mia carriera giocatori di qualit come hamsik e lavezzi un po tutti gli allenatori li vorrebbero allenare lo slovacco ha una personalit incredibile per la sua et punta sempre la porta caratteristica propria dei grandi campioni invece lavezzi devastante in progressione pochi difensori riescono a fermarlo quando in forma la squadra parte gi con un gol di vantaggio oltre questi due talenti apprezzo moltissimo zalayeta che ha grosse potenzialit e soprattutto grande esperienza a livello internazionale se dovessi scegliere un giocatore nellimmediato per il mio pisa prenderei sicuramente il panterone
4003141 ogni partita va affrontata seriamente ma a mio avviso i valori sono certamente a favore del napoli quindi credo torner in italia con un risultato importante a favore
4003142 innanzitutto un allenatore moderno deve avere una preparazione allavanguardia in campo psicologico la gestione mentale dei giocatori al fine dei risultati risulta essere di fondamentale importanza i grandi gruppi sono vincenti anche quando nello spogliatoio si respira unaria armonica per quanto riguarda il discorso dei trascorsi credo che non sia del tutto necessaria lesperienza sul campo di gioco in italia abbiamo lesempio di sacchi che licona della sagacia tattica e della preparazione psicologica del gruppo
4003143 direi sicuramente fabian oneill nellesperienza a cagliari e pizarro ad udine credo che erano gli unici giocatori ai quali i miei schemi non potevano prescindere calciatori eccezionali dotati di una tecnica sopraffina e di una intelligenza tattica invidiabile e poi con i piedi che avevano potevano risolvere le partite in qualsiasi momento
4003144 la roma si mossa pochissimo a parte il colpo riise e per essere tra le prime deve comprare ancora il milan non ha mi ha convinto molto con lacquisto ronaldinho non per il calciatore che un fuoriclasse bensi perch lorganico che necessitava rinforzi in altri reparti la juve invece ha fatto una scelt di qualit prendendo amauri e di prospettiva puntando sui giovani del vivaio a mio avviso la favorita per lo scudetto insieme allinter
4003145 messi pi lo vedo giocare pi mi incanta palla al piede credo sia lunico al mondo inarrestabile tecnica velocit dribbling lo fanno il giocatore pi straordinario del nuovo millennio lo vedrei benissimo a napoli potrebbe essere per voi lerede perfetto di maradona magari potrebbe ripetere le gesta del suo pi noto connazionale
4003146 russotto ha grandissimi numeri messi sarebbe per napoli il nuovo maradona

4003148 marino ha fatto benissimo finora inler farebbe grandi cose nella vostra

4003171 frankie bello anthrax s longtime bassist wasnt able to make the montreal gig due to a family obligation
4003172 our old friend joey is stepping in last minute and helping us out
4003173 ive compared him to john bush on steroids because he definitely comes from more of that tone but also because hes only 31 or 32 years old he listens to the more extreme side of heavy metal he was in a lot of bands that were certainly more extreme than anthrax so hes able to take what he has a lot further thats not to say youre going to hear an anthrax record with death metal or hardcore vocals or anything like that the guys a singer and a great singer at that im just saying that hes already got this really powerful singing voice and hes able to take it to a level weve never explored before we have a bunch of spots on this record where it really works
4003174 before dan we had ideas for maybe two songs and not even any lyrics yet once dan got involved thats when the light bulb went off over my head i wasnt writing anything because i had no focus as far as who was actually going to be singing this stuff once i had dan s voice in my brain it totally opened the door for me writing wise its been really collaborative since then we all get together listen to the music and work on the melody lines until everybody is happy we have two songs done theres a song called revolution screams which is a straight up thrash tune theres another called fight em til you cant which sounds like anthrax from 1987 but in 2008 its total old school thrash im totally stoked on them

4003238 the state government has been involved with the lake kepwari project since 2005 and have spent in excess of 3 million in revegetation
4003239 premier coal has been working on developing the site and improving the water quality
4003240 the idea of making a former mine site into a lake was first presented seven years ago
4003241 without the support of the community this project would not have been possible
4003242 we wanted to create something strategic and sustainable for the future
4003243 with extensive planning and strong community support future developments could be made at the lake
4003244 weve been rehabilitating the area to turn in it into something suitable to the community
4003245 were still assisting in finishing the final rehabilitation around access roads
4003246 the creation of the two training positions to the community has been well received

4003248 we hear complaints about hoons and inappropriate behaviour on the streets
4003249 we need to provide a safe and controlled environment where car enthusiasts can enjoy their sport off the streets in our suburbs
4003250 this is a way to get it off the streets and into a safe controlled environment
4003251 people who use a proper strip under safe instruction dont need to hoon on our roads
4003252 a lot of the hoons i have spoken to have said they only do it because there is nowhere else to go
4003253 my mate steven reese who is originally from victoria always beat me
4003254 so i was always happy when i did win so i could rub it in his face
4003255 bill marlow and graham oliver had been involved in log chopping and had tried to get me to get into it as well
4003256 one day we drove down to boyup brook and unbeknown to me they entered me into a competition
4003257 i came third in that competition and have been involved in log chopping ever since
4003258 a rule my wife has come up with is if we have an argument during the day we have to make up before we go to bed that night
4003259 we went to school together at amaroo primary and have been best friends our whole lives

4003264 i won the tree pegger of the year this year and my young bloke came in second
4003265 i only beat him though because of the handicap but this is good because i probably wont win another one
4003266 we hope that one day one of the boys will be a log chopper as well
4003267 we have been building carparks and roundabouts as well as rehabilitating old open cut mines
4003268 i planned to retire last year but my boss talked me into doing the rehab work

4003270 weve been to karratha katherine weve been to nearly every town in the south west
4003271 my highlights have been chopping against david foster from tasmania and bruce winkle from brisbane
4003272 also from western australia chopping alongside fred woodbridge and brendan williams has been a great pleasure because they are of such a high calibre not that ive done any good against them it just feels good to chop alongside them
4003273 jimmy carmichael is someone ive been chopping with pretty much since the beginning
4003274 radiotherapy treatment requires patients to be in perth for a number of weeks which means travel finding accommodation and being away from their loved ones at what is a very difficult time

4003276 there is no doubt that bunbury needs a radiation oncology service
4003277 this new facility will mean cancer patients in bunbury and its surrounding regions can get more timely radiation therapy without having to travel great distances as they have had to until now
4003278 the new facility will include room for equipment and staff to provide treatment for both public and private patients

4003281 i think it is really a reward for the trade union leaders whove supported us and members who had to make substantial commitments to the future
4003282 they made big decisions in the 80s and 90s which i think has stood the nation in good stead really
4003283 and its a recognition of their contribution rather than me personally
4003284 you dont strive for recognition when you join something like the police force but the recognition is nice and i think it says a lot for the people ive been able to work with

4003288 i believe it was the holy koran which i keep with me in the truck that saved me from the bullets
4003289 in the summer months i would expect to be attacked once or twice a week
4003290 last week we were caught up in an attack on a convoy of fuel trucks on a road we are working on it looked like a war zone with five diesel tanks burst open by rocket propelled grenades and burning diesel flooding out over the road
4003291 the talibans new tactics of blowing bridges between kabul and kandahar forcing convoys to slow down and become softer targets is causing severe problems to companies trying to supply kandahar from kabul
4003292 my family does not know whether i am dead or alive we are not allowed to use phones so i was looking forward to my holiday but now i am too scared to leave because the taliban are waiting just outside and i will get killed
4003293 my boss said the flights are for priority staff only it seems some human life is more valuable than others
4003294 when we started here just over a year ago the situation wasnt as bad but now the taliban are increasing their attacks on us we need the company to give us protection i am speaking on behalf of all of us here in bastion
4003295 when i signed up for the job kbr promised to look after me and provide me security but none of this has happened they just threaten to sack us if we complain

4003298 for a reserve bank that is probably disinclined to raise interest rates this gives them more fodder to keep rates on hold

4003345 i felt isolated from my heritage a college art history professor planted the seeds which many years later would take me on an enlightening journey into the depths of my culture slowly and consistently i have developed a deep understanding of the meaning of my tradition its spiritual beauty has become the expressive power of my art

4003348 vastly less complicated system with two tax rates and a generous standard deduction
4003349 the biggest question is whether or not hell be good on his word on making permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts because of course he opposed these while he was in the senate
4003350 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief
4003351 as a u s senator obamas voting record did not deviate all that much from the standard line of his political party
4003352 the obama plan would redistribute more than 131 billion per year from the top 1 percent of taxpayers to all other taxpayers
4003353 other countries have been lowering their corporate tax rate and broadening the base and similar changes in the united states could be beneficial
4003354 small businesses supply a lot of those companies and it creates jobs for people
4003355 its a roundabout way to try and lower the effective tax rate for businesses by three percent
4003356 when we see tax rates go up and reported income go down we dont know if people have changed their behavior and are earning less money or theyve found different ways to characterize their income
4003357 that said economists generally believe that the behavioral effects of tax increases tend to be small in the short run we see noticeable changes but two or three years down the road behaviors dont look very different

4003365 im slightly offended here beatrice i waited and waited for you to come back to me with your wish and yet here we are months later and no beatrice
4003366 i guess i was wrong about you huh youre just like all the other humans
4003367 oh i see so now im a terribly ungrateful brat because you need to alleviate the burden on your conscience
4003368 clearly you are in no position to be left alone you humans enjoy being dramatic and im not having that on my conscience
4003369 my mind mocks me it sends an elf to keep me from going on maybe my heart will sink so far away from my chest it will deflate and fade and i will die
4003370 i cant believe you still dont believe im real i waited through two seasons for you to come to the woods you ingrate i was so excited to grant you your wish i thought you were the salvation someone who deserved to have a little happiness something i was finally doing right what do you think youre imagining me you think your torment is so awful youre hallucinating
4003371 ive never felt worse in my life what little ive lead so far when you told me i could have a wish all my little heart could focus on was darien i knew exactly what i was going to ask you for
4003372 crushes when i was in elementary school felt exciting ya know an unattainable object like a toy you covet it was fun to giggle and laugh with your girlfriends drawing hearts on your book covers when did it become this
4003373 i never felt this way before boys and crushes were silly things to have all i want is to be seen by him not as this pathetic groupie but the way i feel i guess if he doesnt feel the same way its all wasted
4003374 you were going to tell me about your wish werent you why dont you tell me how you had it all planned out please
4003375 you said you were so powerful you could make it all complete and so believing you instantly and forgetting to use my brain i was all too eager to create the world i wanted with my imagination a small private island in the middle of nowhere one month nevie darien anthony myself all there for one month having to pull together to survive a chance to really be ourselves step up to the plate
4003376 in the daytime the island is fun and beautiful a get away and wed spend it swimming or tanning and picking fresh fruit from bushes and trees at night its this wonderfully quiet and romantic hideout all wed hear is the ocean crashing against the shore as we fell asleep in each others arms gazing at the moon fire dying in our little handmade huts heh

4003394 during the rope line an enthusiastic supporter shook mrs mccains hand and exacerbated an existing condition

4003407 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4003408 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4003409 live up to the obligations it undertook just 24 hours ago
4003410 so that russia can begin to dig out of the hole that its gotten itself into
4003411 engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
4003412 and that is why russia is starting to face international condemnation for what it is doing
4003413 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4003414 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4003415 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4003416 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4003417 will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving

4003467 barry was previously quite religious in islam his birth father barack hussein obama was a muslim economist from kenya before marrying ann dunham hussein obama was married to a woman from kenya who had seven children all the relatives of barrys father were very devout muslims
4003468 we previously often asked him to the prayer room close to the house
4003469 did barak say the arab ritual prayer five times a day
4003470 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them

4003474 nothing it can be proposed in the committee in the plenary
4003475 the house is in agreement to sit down with the senate to discuss charter change we will listen to them they should also listen if house members bring up other matters such as the parliamentary form
4003476 we in the committee have agreed that in the next meeting we will vote on whether to push through or not hopefully we can also come up with a decision on what mode to prefer
4003477 i believe they have bad intentions in supporting senate resolution no 10 but withdrawing my signature does not mean i am not in support of the concept of federalism i am just worried that malaca ang is clearly riding on this to raise the term limits
4003478 i think most of the senators who signed if not all will have to rethink their position if this will open the floodgates to the extension of the presidents term limits a lot of senators will change their positions
4003479 term extension is not in our radar it is only the media and some people who dislike the president who are saying that
4003480 the president will not turn her back on what she said that she will step down in 2010
4003481 lets just wait for the truth to happen we are blinded with bias
4003482 all that she is saying is that there is a resolution therefore lets find out how things will be
4003483 its all part of news management that cha cha has become more important than the moa and to think that cha cha is doomed to fail anyway
4003484 i believe this proposition is right and i will support it even if an evil person endorses it
4003485 as important as the moa could only be drafted and agreed upon if the terms of the same are negotiated under the democratic requirements of absolute transparency and full consultation involving all stakeholders
4003486 no amount of charter change however large the scale of public approval will ever make it right
4003487 heck if all but one filipino were to vote to give away a part of our country so that it becomes a separate country they would all be wrong and a singular voice opposing it would be right
4003488 god damn the bastards who want to give away part of our country just to keep a grip on what remains

4003500 counsels willingness to flout the statutory restriction on the scope of anti slapp fee claims justified the trial court in taking a jaundiced view of the fee request
4003501 blockbilling while not objectionable per se in our view exacerbated the vagueness of counsels fee request a risky choice since the burden of proving entitlement to fees rests on the moving party
4003502 an attorneys chief asset in submitting a fee request is his or her credibility and where vague blockbilled time entries inflated with noncompensable hours destroy an attorneys credibility with the trial court we have no power on appeal to restore it
4003503 indeed the five attorneys defendant deployed on the motion appear to have expended more time telephoning conferencing and e mailing each other than on identifiable legal research for the motion supporting the trial courts conclusion the matter was overstaffed
4003504 counsel may not submit a plethora of noncompensable vague blockbilled attorney time entries and expect particularized individual deletions as the only consequence the trial court could reasonably conclude counsel made no effort to prune the fee request to comply with the law counsel erred grievously by attempting to transfer that responsibility onto the trial court the trial court could reasonably conclude counsels disregard for the law undercut the credibility of their fee request and as officers of the court warranted a severe reaction

4003525 in 2009 we think volumes will continue to soften and will likely remain resonably weak but the biggest risk for asx is if there is an increase in corporate insolvencies leading to a lower number of listings and therefore lower listings revenue
4003526 while the secs intentions may have been good their attempt to protect price with rule making was quite flawed and without intended effect

4003543 it was a surprise and a surprise to our employees who did not see this coming
4003544 we worked closely with our publishers to put it out there to employees before
4003545 it is by far more humane and better and comfortable if you include the employees from the very beginning
4003546 we feel this decision helps us maintain our strong and stable financial performance by further paying down debt
4003547 right now the investment dollars that we have for the company are going into our next generation services like wireless mobility
4003548 we felt that it would be much better for all parties for us to just come out with the news that we are planning to sell the papers before we had lined up the buyer
4003549 cox will make sure that the buyer is appropriate and values the community and what our role has been here for the time theyve owned the paper
4003550 its not a matter of who is ahead or behind in the industry of new media
4003551 part is yes meeting the needs of the industry but the students must know how to gather information for the story all those things have to be balanced and thats what we as faculty strive to do
4003552 the primary focus is to tell latino stories to a national audience that often sees the world in black and white terms
4003553 were really trying to focus on telling deeper stories than what you hear in the media
4003554 in the spirit of the campaign were looking at how we elevate the voices of families
4003555 latino usa covers a segment of families and communities whose voices we want to ensure people hear from
4003556 part of what wed like to do with latino usa in terms of immigrant coverage is to document for all americans that the immigration issue is not just a latino issue
4003557 something ive come to understand more and more is that what were experiencing here in the united states is a worldwide phenomenon in terms of migrants moving across the globe from one place to another
4003558 our job is usually to counter that to bring up really what motivates immigrants to come what are their lives like what are they going through
4003559 i think its a fair sentence i need to pay back
4003560 adaptive reuse which is taking old structures and reutilizing them is our specialty
4003561 were delighted about the redevelopment of the brewery especially in that part of town to take something industrial and turn it into something livable is a great thing
4003562 the lone star brewery has got a lot of charm and weve been waiting for the right company to bring it back to life
4003563 there will be acres of open space pecan trees oaks and 1 100 linear feet of fernage along the riverwalk
4003564 you can make a huge capital investment but you cant control what happens to your neighbors or what happens up and down the road
4003565 bigger sites like this are wonderful because you can do more to control the vision
4003566 i dont want to say they were dehydrated but they were very thirsty
4003567 that can be really valuable even for a college student
4003568 keep your car looking like the day you bought it
4003569 what you want to try to do is make it an unappealing target
4003570 it all started when we rented a 24 track tascan and tried to put down some of matts songs
4003571 we didnt know what we were doing but it was enough fun that we decided to pull some money together and make a go of it we knew there were a lot of bands around so it made sense we eventually ended up buying the tascan
4003572 thats what me and jack still a member of label band little triggers always discussed when we were getting this together we believe in doing what you love with the people you love
4003573 you have to network you have to be seen you have to get the word out any money we make ends up going right back into the company whether its for more equipment or alcohol for parties
4003574 nowadays no one gets to be a rock star with record companies going down the shitter though theres a real chance to make a decent happy living as a working musician
4003575 hopefully anyone who would be in that same position would do the same thing
4003576 people focus too much on trying to pinch every penny out of it sort of taking it in the wrong direction
4003577 we just like playing at a volume that sounds good to us
4003578 its a beautiful contrast i grew up listening to 60s girl groups and the beatles and pink floyd
4003579 i like listening to a song where you can hear these different elements and changes and having something come in layers
4003580 thats the aesthetic that i really love when things arent necessarily perfect or were using frequencies they say shouldnt be broadcast over the radio
4003581 someone wrote this press release where it was like the band is too loud so it destroyed the machine and we all thought that was kind of funny
4003582 what would i do without you the only sensible way to live in this world is without rules

4003586 ha llegado el momento de que el presidente ruso haga honor a su palabra
4003587 si rusia est violando el alto el fuego y tengo informes que no son muy alentadores al respecto entonces esto servir para profundizar el aislamiento internacional en el que rusia se est moviendo

4003593 i think it is really a reward for the trade union leaders whove supported us and members who had to make substantial commitments to the future
4003594 they made big decisions in the 80s and 90s which i think has stood the nation in good stead really
4003595 and its a recognition of their contribution rather than me personally
4003596 you dont strive for recognition when you join something like the police force but the recognition is nice and i think it says a lot for the people ive been able to work with
4003597 he did it all for his electorate and he believed that was his role to represent his constituents and i think he did that in a very honourable and efficient way

4003609 i hate rude behavior in a man i wont tolerate it
4003610 the code preserved a dignity justice and decorum that have since been lost to the great detriment of the professions the public and the government the present generation will think me barbarous but i believe that some lives lost in protecting the tone of the bar and the press on which the republic itself so largely depends are well spent
4003611 its not just music for the united states its world music
4003612 im touching so many different kinds of people on this album as well as keeping my core fan base at the same time
4003613 its totally given me a new energy a new everything
4003614 i want people to say its breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
4003615 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
4003616 but when we see a quarterback we cant do anything about it
4003617 as long as everybodys playing fast were going to do good and thats what we were doing today
4003618 the young guys are really stepping up it was good to see how they would react in certain situations
4003619 i thought malcom williams played well today and overall i was pleased with the receivers
4003620 this is what scrimmages are for to see which players step up and have a good time
4003621 its going to be real efficient and i think its going to be good for us
4003622 you get a little tired but you can really catch defenses off guard
4003623 its good to see how the young guys would react in the stadium to certain situations
4003624 obviously playing the bubble and out on the practice fields is good but theres something about coming into the stadium you can tell who wants it and who doesnt
4003625 i started with a bag and then a cooler now i have a backpack at home its been packed with red bulls and water on the road its been filled with twinkies starbursts snickers and skittles
4003626 its not like im going to go out there and change an approach or anything like that
4003627 im going to go out there with the same approach i normally do against a lefty and i think thats what astros manager would want me to do hes not going to want me to do anything different obviously hes put me there for a reason ill continue doing what im doing
4003628 hes tremendous against lefthanded pitching so this is the perfect opportunity i think for him to lead off he did it once before i think he actually got a base hit and a walk in the game he did it before hes swinging a real good bat right now so we hope were going to ride him a little bit
4003629 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4003630 there is a major change in the singing culture today
4003631 says sathe while adding that the rising popularity of rhythm oriented songs have decreased the importance of lyrics
4003632 i completely agree that there is tremendous talent in the present generation but the tv shows are giving them undue hype and publicity at a very premature level it is easy to win a title but very difficult to maintain that status in the long run
4003633 one needs tremendous practice and time to cultivate and groom their art before entering the arena of open competition
4003634 very few artistes like shreya ghoshal and sunidhi chauhan have managed to live up to expectations but most have simply vanished from the scene
4003635 a multisensory processing of pain an investigation of neural binding mechanisms in electrophysiological and hemodynamic brain responses
4003636 what we are talking about is the elimination of the middle class its a concern but if you look at every single cap system that has happened but thats the system we have and thats no choice
4003637 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there

4003639 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer

4003645 we didnt play as well as we did against annan but maybe that game took a bit out of us we missed a lot of chances in the first 15 minutes
4003646 after 4 1 the game just died we stopped playing altogether we didnt perform at all creetown came back into the game to be fair to them and they hit the post i dont think we were ever in any danger of losing the game but it wasnt a great performance its nice to get the three points and at this time of the season as a manager im more than happy to do that when youre playing saturdays and wednesday
4003647 its their first full game back and i was more than happy for both of them and im sure theres a lot more to come from them as the season goes on
4003648 its hard to get them into it just now because of the quickness of the games coming they were both back on wednesday
4003649 theyre both lacking match sharpness which is understandable but as the weeks go on itll get better
4003650 we started off brightly enough but we had to make a couple of changes because of injuries and we lost our shape
4003651 all credit to mid annandale they fought away and wanted it more before we picked up our injuries the shape was good they were knocking the ball about and they cruised into a 2 0 lead
4003652 i said to my assistant it was a good response from the threave game and we wondered how many it would be then we got the injuries
4003653 theyre young lads and mentality wise weve got to get into them that you dont through away two goal leads
4003654 youve got to defend better and tighten up and keep pushing forward but we just seemed to sit back we gave away a stupid penalty which let them back into it
4003655 ive played there myself about three or four times with annan and ive watched games so i know the area and the park quite well but i dont really know how theyve been doing in their league this year
4003656 its a game to go up to and i still fancy our chances of going up there and getting a result
4003657 we could have got a lot harder teams to play but we know if we can play well we can win were looking forward to it its a wee change playing against a different team on a different park were certainly going up there to get a result and hopefully well get something out of it
4003658 i thought we did ok they were a goal up and we matched them for the first hour but when we lost another goal we started chasing the game i think stranraer will be in the top two or three at the end of the season as i was quite impressed by them
4003659 its just unfortunate that its happened in the opening weekend of the season for the club it would have probably been better if id made this decision a couple of months ago and allowed the manager to prepare his own pre season
4003660 its got to the stage with my family that theyve got to come first and i couldnt let it run any longer i cant put the same input into the football as i would normally do
4003661 ive got a contract with the club and i wont be looking to get involved anywhere else i need to sort a lot of stuff out and i need to spend more time with my kids
4003662 anybody who knows me knows that its all or nothing with football and right now im not willing to be 50 50 with it
4003663 ive no regrets the committee have been a joy to work with and the players have been a dream theyre all players ive brought in i know i will regret making this decision but its got to be done at the moment
4003664 its been the best couple of years in my whole career
4003665 weve taken the club forward from the first season when we won the league and the challenge cup to last season when we moved into the top half of the east premier
4003666 we also had the highest finish for the south team and the youth cup run was also something theyd never achieved before
4003667 i was hoping to be there for five seasons and had a five year plan obviously the first objective was to win the first division and try to establish the south team and the under 19s a bit stronger the next stage was to surpass annan and finish in the top half
4003668 from this season we were looking to compete higher up i still believe that can be achieved this year there are a group of 14 players that im convinced can compete in the top half and take strides forward
4003669 theyre getting a group of players that are second to none they have enthusiasm for the game commitment desire and theyre a disciplined bunch none of them ever missed training
4003670 they are honest lads and if the 14 that are there now i wouldnt swap for anyone in this area if somebody could add one possibly two to that group theres a firm base there to work from
4003671 pauls family has to come first its nothing to do with football and we just have to accept that
4003672 how do you replace him hes taken us to the highest placing in the east premier
4003673 the much hyped sebi meet turned out to be a no show as it decided not to change its policy on p notes
4003674 in the medium to long term the market may not be able to rise sharply as fiis may continue their selling spree
4003675 for those who are simply coming because they have an interest and i can understand their interest they wont be eligible for taxpayer funds
4003676 they will be assisted on a very personal basis by a dedicated court support officer who has been designated to work with all of the former patients who have an interest in this case
4003677 we will be working with former patients and making sure that they understand all of the parts of the court process
4003678 but i think that the general public would understand that there is not taxpayer funds available to assist people who are attending a court case because they are interested in the outcome
4003679 rwe muss r ckgang in den ersten 6 monaten hinnehmen
4003680 i want mine to be 7 up cause 7 days a week hes up

4003682 is it alright if i dont shoot it i need to train
4003683 a major factor in this increase has been the change in
4003684 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue

4003690 this is a milestone in the fight against the discrimination of people living with hiv this health insurance will allow us to get the best possible treatment and change the perception that we are a financial burden on our families along with the kerala government reserving a job for a person living with hiv things are indeed looking up for us
4003691 this is a first step to breaking down financial barriers of hiv people in accessing treatment
4003692 this plan is a pilot to identify the type of insurance schemes that would fit the needs of hiv patients for example to serve lower income plhiv we reduced the premium by 40 per cent and have included coverage of hospitalisation expenses excluding tuberculosis and gastroenteritis before the aids stage
4003693 the idea was to tell people what a heroic task he has done during his tenure you can reach the throne if you know how to overcome obstacles
4003694 its an entertaining game with a clever premise for indians obsessed with politic its named after a hyped just released film itll be forgotten soon but thats the nature of the casual gaming market
4003695 as a tribute to the pm it will be made available for free weve even sent a link to him via his website
4003696 europe does not have autonomous means to send people to space as we have taken a political decision not to do so but india will be sending men into space by 2013 15
4003697 i think it is well within our capability to do that we have enormous potential in space technology and satellite launching chandrayan is going to be launched very soon man in space is not very far behind
4003698 we run out of oxygen in eight and a half hours

4003700 the experience of being totally weightless floating in the cabin is never experienced on earth we went round the earth 16 times a day
4003701 the earth looks beautiful and sometimes its distracting to see the fascinating earth from the window as you have work to do india looks nice especially the himalayas
4003702 the government does not favour a situation where police could be given permission to investigate the judges this would lower judiciarys credibility and undermine its independence a judges committee should be formed at the earlies
4003703 parliament had set an example by expelling 10 mps found guilty of accepting cash for asking questions it is high time now that the judiciary also sets its house in order by setting up an internal mechanism
4003704 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4003705 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4003706 the government and the railways will reply after checking the facts
4003707 suppose i give a gift to you is it wrong
4003708 in yadavs case the person giving the gift and the one taking it are known to each other
4003709 i have been into art and craft ever since my childhood my mother sarla nadkarni is my biggest inspiration who herself has designed various art pieces i started with smaller creations and moved on to murals and fibre pieces once you indulge in this creative art ideas come from nowhere
4003710 teaching is my passion and the way children perceive and participate in this creative exercise gives me immense gratification i wish to teach this art to the poor children so that they are able to make a living out of it
4003711 the other day i was sipping coke and instead of throwing away the straw i thought of making a lamp which turned out to be an incredibly beautiful one i use various materials like wax broomsticks cardboards balloons probably anything which otherwise has its way to the dustbin to make these objects i can make 300 different kinds of flowers and any type of soft toy
4003712 i was doing something i dont normally do changing the theme of the blog but it turned out that it was just after the hacker had got in
4003713 he or she was creating a web page factory within my website that probably within about 24 hours created a few thousand pages every time a search engine came in it would build a new link
4003714 it was amazing i had the site fixed within 48 hours but even a week or two after that if you did a search for some of these things my website came up as number one two three
4003715 we are seeing more and more websites becoming infected we count 16 000 new malicious web pages every day its one every five seconds and 90 of them are on legitimate sites that have been hacked
4003716 a lot of that will be the bad guys setting up blogs with malicious content but some of them will also be sites that have been hacked
4003717 as bloggers have updated to the patched version of wordpress we have seen the number of hacked blogs drop accordingly
4003718 they want to keep it running so they want to avoid being a blip on the radar
4003719 however these types of tools are overkill for most blogs my personal belief is that hosting providers should offer these services
4003720 on saturday morning i do a check of my various blogs and on monday i do it again
4003721 on the internet a lot of traffic comes through google so you want to be sure you have a good record with them
4003722 unii dintre angajatorii romani cred ca statul in scoala e pierdere de vreme ca meseria se invata numai la locul de munca
4003723 this week in zune free three we ignore your musical preferences and send three selections you wouldnt wish on your worst enemy enjoy
4003724 the entry price in some of our retirement villages is quite high
4003725 the arrangements for remaining in supported accommodation within some of the retirement villages is prohibitive there are some older canberrans who dont have the opportunity to seek out supported accommodation in some of our retirement villages and we want to address that
4003726 the model that i saw the village that i visited in richmond in virginia actually certainly sparked for me the possibility of us thinking more laterally about how to provide affordable accommodation for older canberrans in a supported and supportive environment
4003727 these days theres really nothing around thats under around about 350 000
4003728 its an enormous amount of money for people to come up with
4003729 its too early to comment other than to say there is an investigation
4003730 our priority is to make sure that the safety of the travelling public and other members of the public is assured
4003731 its vitally important for this road to be built for the regional traffic which is about 80 per cent of the issue
4003732 well be starting at some point a new terminal over there and we cant do that until weve got this road infrastructure in place but its now moving ahead
4003733 the fact that its ahead of time is going to allow us to move ahead with our terminal

4003735 sekiranya terdapat percubaan pihak tertentu mempertikaikan keutuhan mereka sebagai payung negara ia adalah suatu yang tidak patut berlaku
4003736 prinsip raja berperlembagaan yang menjadi tonggak ketuanan ketuanan melayu dan islam sepatutnya diguanakan sepenuhnya oleh pas demi mempertahankan kedudukan islam yang cuba dicabar oleh musuh islam dengan menggunakan pelbagai topeng dan kesempatan

4003740 de resultaten waren beneden verwachting en de cash flow was zwak
4003741 die fraude hakt er dus per filiaal echt wel in
4003742 controle van gegevens van je nieuwe personeel lijkt toch een heel basale eerste vereiste
4003743 dat uitzenders dit niet allemaal doen is schokkend ook zorgelijk gezien eerdere waarschuwingen niet alleen de controle van de identiteitspapieren ook het checken van de achtergrond van een werknemer is nodig ook de controle of iemand inderdaad al jaren in nederland woont gebeurt vaak niet de uitzendbranche kent het fraudeprobleem best maar het heeft meestal geen prioriteit in het management ze wegen kosten baten en het risico gepakt te worden af
4003744 dat 6 van onze leden paspoorten niet zou controleren ik betwijfel het maar die check moet natuurlijk voor iedereen gelden
4003745 toch kunnen we aantonen dat bij een aantal de basale controles onvoldoende wordt uitgevoerd
4003746 waarom zouden wij willen controleren waar iemand woont zoiets is niet relevant
4003747 bij de helft van de onderzochte abu bedrijven ontbreekt beleid om fraude te voorkomen wie extra controles inbouwt blijkt gewoon effectiever maar het stelsel heeft cru gesproken kennelijk zijn balans gevonden we vinden het wel goed zo met zn allen
4003748 dat er meer gefraudeerd wordt ligt natuurlijk niet alleen aan de uitzenders de fraudeurs zijn steeds inventiever sommige reisdocumenten die aan politiemensen zijn voorgelegd konden zij niet van echt onderscheiden

4003756 russia warned us then that it will set a dangerous precedent for secessionist movements across the former soviet union including chechnya and georgia
4003757 what is the unit of measure for national sovereignty the county the village the city block the individual
4003758 while russia has played coy with the south ossetia issue refraining from recognizing its last declaration of independence in the 1990s and officially supporting georgias territorial integrity it has clearly supported the separatists there
4003759 i cant say if the card was justified or not because i didnt see the play but it is extremely difficult to play a game when you lose a man by the fourth minute

4003762 previous research by kalbach and bosenick 2003 reported no significant differences when users navigated using either right or left navigation panels
4003763 in addition navigation times were faster when users made all selections from the same navigation panel users also preferred this option
4003764 performance and preference measures also showed that the right hand navigation option was a viable design option
4003765 kingsburg and andres research demonstrated that navigational selection limited to either the left or right panels resulted in the best human performance and strongest user preference

4003774 though there are three most beautiful girls in the film ranbir simply rocks in the film be it the music video or the khuda jaane song
4003775 ranbirs dresses and looks change with time and have been worked upon a lot he can be seen trying all sorts of clothes that one can expect a guy from the age of 19 to 30 to wear
4003776 styling was very exciting and challenging as all three actresses are of different types and come at different times in ranbirs life so the styling had to be unique for everyone with no overlapping but one thing i can assure you all the looks would be unique and will have an aki stamp on it

4003795 i am hurt and disappointed that the tourism industry in jammu and kashmir has been hit by the unrest in the state till a few months back the hotels were booked there were no rooms available and the houseboats were packed but the situation is really bad now
4003796 i feel so bad that tourism which is the mainstay of the kashmir valley has been cut off totally this year the valley saw a fabulous season which also meant a lot of employment for the people every citizen should do his or her bit to calm the pent up tension
4003797 it is frustrating that political parties are taking advantage of such situations the agitation is being fanned by vested interests i dont want to name any party
4003798 kashmir had a sense of alienation but the continued peace process was able to remove the obstacle there were elections and everyone participated in it the six year coalition government saw peace in the valley
4003799 the democratic process saw accelerated growth of the three regions of kashmir jammu and ladakh this unrest is a setback to the whole process

4003808 barack obama hails from chicago and lives four blocks from the site of the opening and closing ceremony
4003809 there is no denying that barack living a few blocks from the olympic village will be more closely associated with the bid

4003818 yes we are meeting often we are working on a film together but i cant talk about it however i would like to clarify that its not true that salman and i ever had any problems while working with each other
4003819 the film is not joker its salmans idea and he wants shirish to direct it the talks began when they bumped into each other at an event and connected the film will be a james bond like stylish action thriller with hollywood technicians its being made on a very huge scale and salman might even produce it

4003859 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4003860 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

4003866 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4003867 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4003868 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4003869 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4003870 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right

4003881 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4003882 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4003883 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4003884 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4003885 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it

4003963 darunter sind allein 100 000 dachziegel und bis zu 2 000 t ren
4003964 unser fokus liegt in diesem jahr darauf historische bauteile in ihrem umfeld darzustellen so wird die treppenanlage der in leipzig abgerissenen kleinen funkenburg aufgestellt genauso wie geretteten bauteile aus dem dorf heuersdorf das gerade abgebaggert wird
4003965 gro e fotos sollen zu einem wiedererkennungseffekt f hren zudem werden wir viele interessante fakten liefern
4003966 das beginnt bei sch lern die hier zum beispiel die funktionsweise alter kastenschl sser erkunden und bei designstudenten der burg giebichenstein die sich in komplexe t rklinkensammlungen vertiefen aber auch restauratoren architekten und handwerker die beispielsweise nach alten vorlagen f r verloren gegangene bauteile suchen werden hier f ndig
4003967 vielleicht findet sich ja ein russischer oder amerikanischer interessent der in die restaurierung dieses einmaligen originalschauplatzes investieren will
4003968 zumal es die im gleichen zusammenhang bekannt gewordene torgauer br cke nicht mehr gibt
4003969 zwar gibt es in den niederlanden sehr gute sammlungen historischer bauteile aber sie sind rein kommerziell ausgerichtet
4003970 in frankreich und italien bewahrt man dagegen aus nichtkommerziellen gr nden alte bauteile auf nur nicht in der gro en bandbreite wie bei uns
4003971 frankreich polen tschechien und sterreich signalisierten bereits interesse genau wie die ukraine die auf der denkmal 2006 auf uns aufmerksam geworden ist nach unserem vorbild wollte man dort eine bauteilesammlung und ein bildungszentrum f r handwerkliche denkmalpflege etablieren doch bisher ist das projekt meines wissens nach noch nicht an den start gegangen
4003972 zwar bewahren wir bei uns eine gro e vielfalt an bauteilen auf aber sie stammen berwiegend aus sachsen beziehungsweise mitteldeutschland insofern sind wir jederzeit an internationalen kooperationen interessiert zum beispiel an einem austausch mit dem bauarchiv des bayerischen landesamtes f r denkmalpflege in thierhaupten das einen ganz anderen kulturkreis vertritt
4003973 mittlerweile hat unsere bekanntheit deutlich zugenommen und wir erhalten auch anfragen aus der s chsischen landeshauptstadt und aus den angrenzenden bundesl ndern sollte ein kunde bei uns nicht f ndig werden k nnen wir ber ein netzwerk von deutschlandweiten h ndlern eine l sung anbieten

4003985 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4003986 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4003987 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4003988 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4003989 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4003990 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4003991 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4003992 it was not so much a matter of soundness it was a matter of fitness

4004006 sekolah saya dulu berpindah pindah saya pernah di jakarta lalu di taman siswa yogyakarta kemudian menyelesaikan hbs hoogere burgerschool di semarang tahun 1949 setelah itu saya masuk institut teknologi bandung dan meraih sarjana muda tahun 1955 saya melanjutkan studi di technische universiteit tu delft lulus tahun 1958
4004007 lalu saya ke stuttgart dan bekerja sebagai communication engineer di standard elektrik lorenz yang sekarang dikenal dengan nama alcatel
4004008 saat itu saya benar benar bingung bagaimana ini ingin pulang tetapi tidak bisa sampai rumah malah terdampar di negeri orang saya memutuskan untuk membatalkan kepulangan seluruh koper dan barang bawaan diturunkan lagi padahal saat itu uang sudah habis tetapi dari sinilah seolah seluruh hidup saya berubah saya kembali lagi bekerja di stuttgart sebagai radar system engineer di aeg telefunken perusahaan ini sekarang menjadi european aeronautic defence and space eads
4004009 meski sudah pensiun hingga tahun 2003 saya masih diminta menjadi consulting engineer eads

4004011 saya sendiri sudah tidak ingat lagi berapa rancangan radar antena dan rancangan sinyal radar yang sudah saya patenkan itu bisa dibuka di internet
4004012 itu sebabnya negeri sebesar indonesia yang terdiri dari banyak pulau memerlukan radar yang banyak dan canggih guna mendeteksi apa pun yang berseliweran di udara dan di laut mata telanjang mungkin tidak bisa melihat apalagi dengan teknologi yang semakin canggih pesawat bisa melintas tanpa meninggalkan suara semua itu bisa dideteksi agar indonesia aman
4004013 tiba tiba saja saya teringat teman teman lama seperti soewarso martosuwignyo krisno sutji dan lainnya saya tidak tahu mungkinkah saya bertemu mereka lagi

4004020 i think were acquiring a talented player thats about to hit his prime being only 25 he can be a traditional point guard for us but also bring the added dimension of scoring
4004021 this again shows ownerships commitment to winning a championship here in cleveland and making the investment necessary along the way
4004022 we like him very much and remain hopeful well find a common ground on the contract
4004023 he was the consummate professional while he was here on and off the court
4004024 hes one of those guys whos capable of rising up at important times obviously we want to be playing in those times
4004025 when you have a player like lebron youd be crazy not to play through him hes not a scorer hes a basketball player who makes plays for himself and other people
4004026 she had an incredible commitment to humanitarian issues and was a wonderfully sensitive and dedicated person
4004027 they were travelling in white toyota landcruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles
4004028 their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation
4004029 that her life should come to such a brutal end while working to help others makes this an even greater tragedy this was a cowardly act that deserves widespread condemnation
4004030 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
4004031 in the name of freedom these websites allow the broadcast of slander lies and swearing the use of harsh degrading language and racial slurs without regard for the reader or those concerned
4004032 in the name of freedom these websites allow the broadcast of slander lies and swearing the use of harsh degrading language and racial slurs without regard for the reader or those concerned
4004033 even though the government has been tolerant of anti government positions and criticisms on the internet we are very concerned about statements that insult religion and reek of racism
4004034 the russians have started to withdraw the georgian police and special forces are taking control
4004035 i think a lot depends on what happens over the next few weeks
4004036 if we are able to have continued access in terms of humanitarian supplies to these people if there is safe space for the civilians in that area if both sides respect their responsibility to allow displaced people to move where they want to move they i think a crisis can be avoided
4004037 the ethnic majority sinhala nation is intent on occupying and enslaving the tamil homeland
4004038 our military is only involved in a war of self defence against this war of the sinhala nation
4004039 we will liberate the north sooner than people even think when you need to look at a bigger target a bigger goal you need to make certain sacrifices down the line and these are the sacrifices and for these sacrifices we are not going to let them down
4004040 our recent channel checks show that the industry pendulum has swung into a buyers market where customers are holding back orders
4004041 over shipment of large area lcd panels in the second quarter due to an overly optimistic outlook for 2008 was the main factor contributing to the rapid and significant panel price reductions seen in the panel supply chain beginning in june
4004042 in terms of the merger with dish we really have nothing new to say
4004043 i dont know whether the wall street journal needed to fill a page or what but i have nothing theres really nothing
4004044 it certainly doesnt change the world from black to white
4004045 we will continue to look at things from top to bottom but there is not a whole lot new to say about what we can do or would do with dish wed do things that make sense if we could find them today
4004046 i think over the next few years additional tools not only in how you see the 3 d films but how you capture them will make 3 d pretty much a standard part of the filmmaking process
4004047 weve really seen this overwhelmingly embraced by the filmmaking community some of the best filmmakers in the world from james cameron to peter jackson to steven spielberg not just looking at but also producing in this medium now
4004048 certainly youll see a large majority of the tent pole films studios expect to be their biggest grossers and large films in the next few years go to 3 d
4004049 the problem at the beginning was of course that there were very few theaters in the united states that could actually show a 3 d experience
4004050 i can tell you one thing an awful lot of movie theaters are suddenly counting on this because they are in trouble
4004051 they cant raise concessions any higher than they have because thats the biggest complaint moviegoers have now
4004052 the studios are considering financing some of these theater chains but already to create a 3 d movie is about 15 million extra to outfit a whole chain of say amcs across the country with digital capabilities thats going to get expensive
4004053 this actually parallels similar technology advances like color and sound
4004054 this signals that the medium is now getting to a maturity level where we can really produce just about anything in 3 d
4004055 theres definitely some question of whether these 3 d movies are going to sell people more and more are buying hd screens and plasma screens and audio systems
4004056 it is almost like watching a movie in your house
4004057 a large percentage of those polled would not go more often to the movies in fact a large percentage would stop going to the movies if they had to pay a lot more for the 3 d movies
4004058 we already have 13 films scheduled to be released in 2009
4004059 were going to see some extraordinary new types of 3 d experiences

4004067 what is now seen as a predominantly younger pastime will spread to encompass a wider group of people in part due to the aging of current online video viewers but also as a result of word of mouth spread of services growth of in home networks and new network connected consumer electronic devices

4004073 most single cabinet surround systems typically require reflective walls to optimize a sonic image but with slimstage weve effectively removed this barrier by incorporating patented surround and speaker technologies that dont rely on walls or subwoofers to produce a pinpoint surround sound image and our patented technologies have allowed us to develop a super slim cabinet which unlike others has bass and nearly disappears on furniture or under a flat panel tv
4004074 the direct to dvd movie is as old as the dvd business itself
4004075 but what has happened in the last three years is that you cant make any old movie and throw it together and expect the consumer to buy and rent it
4004076 there are only so many theatrical spots and we need to make things that debut on other platforms
4004077 everybody has to remain competitive and one of the ways to do this is to elevate our productions
4004078 with joy ride i think we were really able to get a great up and coming cast with nicki aycox and nick zano and really let them find their characters it didnt used to be that way with direct to video where people would punch the clock and bail we are really bringing the a game

4004082 and its harder and harder to get space and have success at retail with something non branded
4004083 we want to keep a close eye on whether the market can bear this many titles
4004084 we are firmly committed to becoming a vendor of choice in the cable industry leveraging decades of systems and manufacturing excellence and todays announcement asserts our commitment
4004085 cable broadcast and telco tv are all highly competitive markets for video servers
4004086 cable and broadcast are the more traditional modes of entertainment for consumers but cable providers and telcos have been quicker to adapt to market trends and to offer innovative consumer services but to remain competitive even the broadcast segment has tried its hand at hybrid deployments and similar initiatives
4004087 even the smaller more specialized video server vendors are doing well in this buoyant market
4004088 all the existing tools were written in the day of 16 bit processors

4004155 western countries should not support them israel so much the life of this regime has come to an end
4004156 our position is clear on this issue a referendum should take place in palestine if they withdraw from invaded lands it would be a good step
4004157 the life of the regime israel has come to an end
4004158 i think a lot depends on what happens over the next few weeks
4004159 if we are able to have continued access in terms of humanitarian supplies to these people if there is safe space for the civilians in that area if both sides respect their responsibility to allow displaced people to move where they want to move they i think a crisis can be avoided
4004160 the ethnic majority sinhala nation is intent on occupying and enslaving the tamil homeland
4004161 our military is only involved in a war of self defence against this war of the sinhala nation

4004164 i heard that he was doing well and hes healthy were just interested in what the charges are
4004165 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4004166 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4004167 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4004168 only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
4004169 the very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
4004170 the georgian leadership is a special project for the united states
4004171 at some time it will be necessary to choose between supporting this virtual project and real partnership on questions which actually require collective action
4004172 very clear eyed about his relationship with the russian leaders
4004173 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4004174 it is simply not a requirement of this mission and it is not something we are seeking to do
4004175 i feel amazing i finished such a great meet as part of the relay its amazing
4004176 there wasnt a lot of nerves just a lot of excitement im so impressed with everything that happened

4004181 the most important thing for me is playing hockey and because i am playing hockey i got the opportunity to go on playboy otherwise i wouldnt i have no plans on a career in modelling
4004182 for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it not everybody can go on the cover of playboy

4004189 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4004190 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4004191 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4004192 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4004193 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4004194 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4004195 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4004196 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4004197 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4004198 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4004199 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4004200 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4004201 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4004202 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4004246 bawalah khamishahku ini kepada abu jahm dan datangkan untukku anbijaniyyahnya abu jahm karena khamisah ini hampir menyibukkanku dari shalatku tadi
4004247 hadits ini menunjukkan bersegeranya rasulullah untuk memperbaiki shalat melakukan hal hal yang memberi kemashalahatan bagi ibadah shalat serta menyingkirkan apa yang mungkin menodai pelaksanaannya di mana beliau melepas khamishah yang dikenakannya menyuruh sahabatnya untuk mengembalikannya dan meminta penggantinya berupa pakaian lain yang tidak menyibukkan
4004248 hadits ini menunjukkan keharusan meyingkirkan apa saja yang dapat menyibukkan orang yang shalat dari ibadah shalatnya dan melalaikannya hadits ini juga mengandung hasungan untuk menghadap sepenuhnya pada amalan shalat dan khusyuk di dalamnya sebagaimana pula hadits ini menunjukan bahwa pikiran sedikit sejenak tersibukkan dengan perkara selain shalat tidaklah mencacati keabsahan shalat
4004249 singkirkan dari kami qirammu ini karena gambar gambarnya terus menerus terbayang bayang dalam shalatku
4004250 jangan engkau membiarkan satu gambar makhluk hidup kecuali engkau haus dan jangan pula membiarkan ada satu kuburan yang ditinggalkan kecuali engkau ratakan
4004251 ia pernah masuk menemui rasulullah ternyata ia dapatkan beliau sedang shalat di atas tikar beliau sujud di atas tikar tersebut
4004252 tidak ada perbedaan pendapat di kalangan fuqaha di berbagai negeri tentang bolehnya shalat di atas beralas khumrah keculai perbuatan yang diriwayatkan dari umar bin abdil aziz bahwa ia pernah meminta tanah lalu diletakkannya di atas khumrahnya untuk kemudian sujud di atas tanah tersebut mungkin apa yang dilakukan oleh umar bin abdil aziz ini karena berlebih lebihannya beliau dalam sikap tawadhu dan khusyuk dengan begitu dalam perbuatan beliau ini tidak ada penyelisihan dengan pendapat jamaah yang menyatakan bolehnya sujud di atas khumrah ibnu abi syaibah meriwaytkan dari urwah ibnuz zubair bahwa ia membenci memakruhkan shalat di atas sesuatu selain bumi tanah membenci shalat dengan memakai alas demikian pula riwayat dari selain urwah namun dimungkinkan makruhnya di sini adalah karahah tanzih bukan haram
4004253 tidak apa apa shalat di atas hamparan tikar dan permadani dari wol kulit dan bulu sebagaimana dibolehkan shalat di ats kain dari katun linen dan seluruh bahan yang suci
4004254 sebelum aku menjawab pertanyaan ini aku hendak mengatakan bahwa syariat islam ini alhamdulillah telah sempurna dari seluruh sisi
4004255 jangan ia berpaling membatalkan shalatnya sampai ia mendegar suara angin atau ia mendapati baunya
4004256 apabila salah seorang dari kalian shalat maka hendaknya ia memakai kedua sandalnya atau ia lepaskan di antara kedua kakinya dan jangan ia mengganggu orang ain dengan kedua sandalnya
4004257 selisihilah yahudi karena mereka tidak shalat dengan mengenakan sandal dan tidak pula khuf mereka
4004258 hadits ini memberi faedah disenanginya shalat dengan memakai sandal karena rasulullah memerintahkannay dengan alasan untuk menyelisihi yahudi
4004259 apabila salah seorang dari kalian shalat maka hendaknya ia memakai kedua sandalnya atau ia lepaskan keduanya

4004266 we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
4004267 the democratic party strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions

4004286 the decision to authorise the shot was reasonable given the circumstances of the incident
4004287 this result severely restricts the freedom of the media in covering the conflict when journalists are fired at by the soldiers to kill people virtually without ascertaining whether or not they are opening fire on journalists

4004311 in my eyes the male is meant to be on the receiving end of anal sex the positioning of the prostate gland makes this obviously true and a mans interest in anal sex with women comes primarily from his own subconscious desire to be the one penetrated femdom strapon

4004323 we would just like to appeal for sensitivity because at times even if the nature of our jobs dictate we have to temper it in order to guard some sensitivities or some feelings that may be hurt
4004324 i think the position of the afp here is for the members of the media to police their own ranks maybe to guard each others coverage maybe to caution each other if one is going out of bounds
4004325 i think that is not up for me to say maybe the members of the media can talk among themselves

4004389 a state department official called obamas senate office to inform him in almost a routine bureaucratic way that a breach had occurred
4004390 as far as we can tell in each of the three cases it was imprudent curiosity
4004391 none at this point in time that we have determined
4004392 this is an outrageous breach of security and privacy even from an administration that has shown little regard for either over the last eight years
4004393 if you try to please everyone you will please no one and lose yourself in the process
4004394 today iowa democrats again turned out in large numbers to reject the failed bush mccain campaign and its policies
4004395 every single one counts and thats why weve been here organizing
4004396 barack obama stands for a lot of the same things that john edwards stood for

4004398 let us pledge that we will unite behind our nominee be it he or she
4004399 i am going to be talking about not just reverend wright but the larger issue of race in this campaign

4004403 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4004404 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4004405 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4004406 girls want to make sure they stay looking young from an early age
4004407 its just tragic thats all i can say about it

4004411 the extradition procedure is difficult complicated and time consuming and we cannot predict the timetable extradition is a very sensitive international legal issue so it will require close consultation with britain
4004412 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose
4004413 russian incursions into georgia from south ossetia or from abkhazia are contrary to international law the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly

4004416 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4004417 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4004418 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4004419 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4004420 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4004421 whats fascinating here is that we see that nature is able to produce events that can manifest themselves at several locations
4004422 in a sense these instantaneous events seem to happen from outside space time in that its not a story you can tell within space time

4004424 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4004425 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4004426 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

4004452 they will be assisted on a very personal basis by a dedicated court support officer who has been designated to work with all of the former patients who have an interest in this case
4004453 we will be working with former patients and making sure that they understand all of the parts of the court process
4004454 but i think that the general public would understand that there is not taxpayer funds available to assist people who are attending a court case because they are interested in the outcome

4004463 i am obligated to follow the law but i also have the obligation to defend and protect the country as commander in chief with that in mind it is possible that these two responsibilities will come into conflict and anything hindering me from that role can be considered unconstitutional

4004482 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
4004483 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
4004484 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
4004485 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the so the pill puts a womans body into a post mating state even though she might be still in the game
4004486 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time

4004591 wir sind in der annahme nicht ins spiel gekommen und dann wird es schwer
4004592 we came to an idea to do something special that will be only ours
4004593 and we agreed because we are a team we fight for each other and we die for each other and we wanted to do something not so usual among other teams
4004594 the croats have won each of their three preliminary games by at least three goals they opened with an 11 7 victory against italy and then beat rival serbia 11 8
4004595 croatia is at the moment the favorite for the final
4004596 after missing the first couple it seemed like i kept forcing it it was totally in my head not taking the time to relax and put it where i needed to put it
4004597 the americans will try to rebound saturday against the mustached croats the match will pit current croatia coach ratko rudic against his former team
4004598 they are enjoying it and joking with this its a good dose of atmosphere for the team
4004599 a matter of great pleasure for me to convey my warm felicitations to you and the people of india
4004600 let me take this opportunity to reiterate my governments commitment to improve relations with india by resolving all outstanding disputes between the two countries in a just and peaceful manner
4004601 way too fast its a new generation and its now time to step aside
4004602 they did a great job im from the previous generation with alex popov
4004603 ive raced many times against alain but i didnt know he was in my league we met before the races and hes a great guy and we have a good relationship im very happy with an ambassador like alain hes a great sportsman
4004604 its been a very long time my fourth olympics my fourth final in the 100 freestyle
4004605 the olympics is very special to me when i was 10 years old watching seoul watching matt biondi i got really inspired
4004606 i thought maybe it was possible to make history and win three times in a row but in 2005 i got really set back and started from zero
4004607 after eight long years and swimming three times in a row 47 seconds this is under my best i did in sydney its a big achievement for me personally im realizing it now because a few minutes ago i was very very disappointed because i was close to the bronze its weird but i was only thinking about ways to win the race and that was impossible with guys like eamon and bernard
4004608 the chinese have improved a lot in the last few months they are a much stronger side now a physical and strong team it was a difficult match for us and i am glad we came out of it well
4004609 they are the top team in the world and showed it on the field
4004610 they have outstanding technique and are able to adjust to different situations we study each opponent and try and take the good points
4004611 we have to beat both korea and australia to remain in contention
4004612 its not going to be easy but we have our plans for the korean team there are no special feelings about playing against a team from my country i am the chinese coach and want china to win

4004616 what do i want to change or achieve right now
4004617 saya salahkan kerajaan kerana sikap angkuh majlis peguam dan membelakangkan persefahaman yang dibuat dahulu
4004618 sepatutnya kerajaan melarang majlis berkenaan pengislaman anjuran majlis peguam diadakan tetapi sebaliknya kerajaan biarkan rakyat protes
4004619 protes boleh dihalang tetapi hati dan perasaan mereka yang memprotes dan lebih ramai lagi yang bersependapat dengan mereka terus meluap dan marah kemungkinan ialah perasaan marah ini akan meningkat kerana keangkuhan majlis peguam malaysia yang masih ingin mengadakan majlis yang serupa pada masa terdekat
4004620 setelah diberi muka oleh zaid ibrahim de facto menteri undang undang dan beranggapan yang kerajaan sekarang takut pada mereka majlis peguam bukan main lagi sanggup juarai semua isu yang sensitif
4004621 apabila hakim ian chin tuduh saya kononnya ugut hakim hakim presiden majlis peguam ambiga sreenivasan desak supaya kerajaan siasat saya
4004622 sejak barisan nasional di bawah pimpinan datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi dan sejak datuk zaid ibrahim sebagai de facto menteri undang undang cuba menawan hati majlis peguam dengan memberi kuasa kepada ahli majlis memilih hakim dan memberi sagu hati kepada bekas bekas hakim yang disingkir majlis peguam begitu garang sekali
4004623 erstens geht das saisonbereinigungsverfahren von einer deutlichen fr hjahrsbelebung im bausektor aus die aber nicht eintreten wird da aufgrund der milden witterung bereits im winter kr ftig gebaut wurde
4004624 zweitens konnten viele bauauftr ge bereits im winterquartal erf llt werden die im zweiten quartal nun fehlten
4004625 das ist nicht 1968 und die invasion in der tschechoslowakei wo russland einen nachbarn bedrohen die hauptstadt besetzen eine regierung st rzen und damit durchkommen kann
4004626 i think it would do a disservice to the city to try to undo all of that in fact i think that talented people like yourselves who are so interested i would ask to please help us in moving forward
4004627 it is the pivotal question in the survey and the one that was most eye opening
4004628 it was almost a reversal of the result that the committee received for its survey
4004629 we took all the information and came up with the recommendations that we did so its not like were ramming anything down anyones throat theres no ramming going on here
4004630 its one thing to dismiss me or any one individual but when they out of hand dismiss this whole survey theyre dismissing hundreds of residents of voting age i think its not wise and reckless
4004631 were saying take your foot off the pedal a little bit step back and see if there really is buy in in the community
4004632 i just want to let the residents out there know we are listening yes
4004633 and we are watching out for your money and we are making sure its spent wisely and its not always going to be in total agreement with everyone in the city
4004634 i said maam please come over and talk to us
4004635 she was despondent i dont know if she understood english
4004636 i saved a lot of lives in nam this one was out of reach
4004637 if residents in coastal zones want to ban drilling thats something we want to encourage
4004638 in all fairness we think that they should be able to get some compensation for what happened to them
4004639 its still horribly ill conceived and this one more unconstitutional on its face than its former version
4004640 i just think it would have no chance of holding up in court
4004641 i think theres quite a bit of opposition to the bill
4004642 it was intended to be limiting but i think its just the opposite
4004643 durante seis a os the clash ilumin un camino que los llev muy lejos de sus inicios como combatientes punk rockers a la escena mundial donde su mejor m sica fue el ltimo basti n de resistencia contra el sue o totalitario de la era reagan tatcher
4004644 does my british passport have to be valid for six months beyond my date of departure from the united states
4004645 i think it is really a reward for the trade union leaders whove supported us and members who had to make substantial commitments to the future
4004646 they made big decisions in the 80s and 90s which i think has stood the nation in good stead really
4004647 and its a recognition of their contribution rather than me personally
4004648 you dont strive for recognition when you join something like the police force but the recognition is nice and i think it says a lot for the people ive been able to work with
4004649 he did it all for his electorate and he believed that was his role to represent his constituents and i think he did that in a very honourable and efficient way
4004650 people have a chance to see how far weve come it was a simpler time
4004651 what were doing is opening the doors and windows to aspects of the real world that are hard to learn about secondhand its firsthand
4004652 for those who are simply coming because they have an interest and i can understand their interest they wont be eligible for taxpayer funds
4004653 they will be assisted on a very personal basis by a dedicated court support officer who has been designated to work with all of the former patients who have an interest in this case
4004654 we will be working with former patients and making sure that they understand all of the parts of the court process
4004655 just think back to the last time you fell in love with a stranger
4004656 its terribly sad but another example of how communication or a lack of communication can get in the way
4004657 when i heard about it i was really unhappy and distressed now i understand how it happened anger is counter productive
4004658 i dont want to off side the ranger and the council i dont want to make enemies of these people there is no point shit happens sometimes weve all been there
4004659 it was taken down by graffiti removal people its not their brief to make sure they are careful they were just doing their job
4004660 those designers who have the stomach to go again will do theirs again i assume they may not go back because its very labour intensive
4004661 i was annoyed and frustrated because it was a joy to see this work in the street at it was terrible the way these designers were treated

4004670 its quite an extraordinary thing its the first time a preacher has convened the two presumptive candidates they are both fighting for that vote
4004671 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4004672 it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
4004673 they injected an anesthetic but didnt wait long enough for it to take effect
4004674 the next week their boss came to me and said your family still doesnt want to pay ransom so we have to send them another one
4004675 i cant describe the anguish i felt imagining pedros suffering
4004676 violence will keep increasing to the extent that mexican law enforcement doesnt take away the attraction of committing a crime
4004677 the media and society as a whole has finally recognized that there is a problem
4004678 we cant tolerate any more of this level of impunity and criminal activities
4004679 its criminals who should be afraid its the bad politicians who should be afraid its the judges who set these murderers free the ones who should be afraid its the corrupt police officers who should be afraid not us
4004680 we want a specific political accord between the president and all 32 governors of mexico to commit to reducing the rates of kidnapping in mexico
4004681 the state is not dismantling organized crime groups through the confiscation of assets freezing of assets of the financial intelligence unit and is not cooperating with police and prosecutors effectively
4004682 because nothing much has been done every day there are more and more kidnappings and everybody is affected
4004683 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
4004684 systemic antibiotics pills or injections as opposed to creams were implicated in 19 3 percent of all emergency department visits for drug related adverse events
4004685 persons aged 15 44 years accounted for an estimated 41 2 percent of ed visits infants accounted for only an estimated 6 3 percent of ed visits
4004686 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events
4004687 antibiotics are among the most frequently used medications in the united states annually antibiotics are prescribed to an estimated 16 percent of patients during ambulatory care visits and pharmaceutical manufacturers spend 1 billion promoting antibiotics
4004688 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4004689 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4004690 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4004691 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4004692 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4004693 far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
4004694 i just tried to black out the whole thing it was bad
4004695 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4004696 the weakening korean won continues to trigger additional air cargo demand from korean exporters
4004697 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4004698 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4004699 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before

4004737 tak tahulah ayahku orang sepertinya baru sekali ini aku melihatnya
4004738 ketahuilah dialah yang menghapuskan kenikmatan sementara dialah yang memisahkan pertemuan di dunia dialah malaikatul maut
4004739 pintu pintu langit telah terbuka para malaikat telah menanti ruhmu semua syurga terbuka lebar menanti kedatanganmu
4004740 jangan khawatir wahai rasul allah aku pernah mendengar allah berfirman kepadaku kuharamkan syurga bagi siapa saja kecuali umat muhammad telah berada di dalamnya
4004741 uushiikum bis shalati wa maa malakat aimanuku peliharalah shalat dan peliharalah orang orang lemah di antaramu
4004742 kini buka tangan sudah lumrah maka perlu ada peningkatan model pakaian yang lebih maju lagi yakni terbuka bagian atas dada kamu
4004743 pakaian kok hanya gitu gitu saja cari model atau bahan lain yang lebih bagus
4004744 banyak model dan kain yang agak tipis lalu bentuknya dibuat yang agak ketat biar lebih enak dipandang
4004745 pakaian seperti ini membuat susah berjalan atau duduk soalnya sempit apa nggak sebaiknya di belah hingga lutut atau mendekati paha
4004746 yah tersingkap sedikit nggak apa apa lah yang penting enjoy
4004747 baju panjang benar benar membuat repot kalau hanya dengan membelah sedikit bagiannya masih kurang leluasa lebih enak kalau di potong saja hingga atas mata kaki
4004748 oh ada yang kelupaan kalau kamu bakai baju demikian maka jilbab yang besar tidak cocok lagi sekarang kamu cari jilbab yang kecil agar lebih serasi dan gaul toh orang tetap menamakannya dengan jilbab
4004749 ternyata kebanyakan manusia menyukai apa yang kamu lakukan buktinya mereka tidak bereaksi apa apa kecuali hanya beberapa orang kalau langkah kakimu masih kurang leluasa maka cobalah kamu cari model lain yang lebih enak bukankah kini banyak rok setengah betis dijual di pasaran tidak usah terlalu mencolok hanya terlihat kira kira sepuluh senti saja
4004750 ah jelas enggak kan sekarang zaman sudah berubah kalau zaman dulu para lelaki mengangkat pakaiannya hingga setengah betis maka wanitanya harus menyelisihi dengan menjulurkannya hingga menutup telapak kaki tapi kini lain sekarang banyak laki laki yang menurunkan pakaiannya hingga bawah mata kaki maka wanitanya harus menyelisihi mereka yaitu dengan mengangkatnya hingga setengah betis atau kalau perlu lebih ke atas lagi sehingga nampak seluruh betisnya
4004751 fitnah ah itu kan zaman dulu di masa itu kaum laki laki tidak suka kalau wanita menampakkan auratnya sehingga wanita wanita mereka lebih banyak di rumah dan pakaian mereka sangat tertutup tapi sekarang sudah berbeda kini kaum laki laki kalau melihat bagian tubuh wanita yang terbuka malah senang dan mengatakan ooh atau wow bukankah ini berarti sudah tidak ada lagi fitnah karena sama sama suka lihat saja model pakaian di sana sini dari yang di emperan hingga yang yang bermerek kenamaan seperti kristian dior semuanya menawarkan model yang dirancang khusus untuk wanita maju di zaman ini kalau kamu tidak mengikuti model itu akan menjadi wanita yang ketinggalan zaman
4004752 pakaian membutuhkan variasi jangan itu itu saja sekarang ini modelnya rok mini dan agar serasi rambut kepala harus terbuka sehingga benar benar kelihatan indah
4004753 prevenir la violencia entre los escolares y resolver de una manera pac fica los conflictos que a diario surgen en las aulas
4004754 queremos dotar a los j venes de las herramientas necesarias para que aprendan a resolver conflictos y usen la palabra como instrumento para ello
4004755 que el acoso escolar es un proceso relacionado con el grupo de iguales no s lo se refiere a la persona intimidada sino tambi n a una serie de espectadores lo que se rompe con este programa es el pacto de silencio sellado entre v ctimas acosadores y testigos
4004756 as es mucho m s sencillo y efectivo que si tienen que hablar o escribir sobre el tema responden con mucha m s libertad y sin sentirse coaccionados
4004757 ha sido fant stico y efectivo primero lo aplicamos con alumnos de 13 y 14 a os los del primer ciclo de la eso porque est constatado que la mayor a de los casos de acoso se produce a estas edades luego lo extendimos a los de segundo ciclo
4004758 los centros tienen diferentes protocolos de actuaci n con la informaci n recogida sin embargo desde el programa les facilitamos una serie de medidas de prevenci n que utilizan los centros piloto como el de fuenlabrada y que funcionan con cierto grado de xito todas se basan en la intervenci n mediante compa eros y compa eras en el grupo es donde se genera el maltrato y a trav s de l tratamos de solucionar el problema
4004759 fortalecer la red social del alumno que ha sufrido el abuso a trav s de entrevistas con compa eros a los que se les pide que nos informen sobre la situaci n y se les pregunta si pueden hacer un hueco en su pandilla al compa ero agredido as como apoyarle en diversas situaciones en el centro tambi n se realiza una colocaci n de la clase que favorezca al estudiante marginado o se organizan los grupos del centro del a o siguiente atendiendo tambi n a las variables socioafectivas de la clase
4004760 si hace siete a os tramit bamos 70 expedientes que implican expulsiones definitivas o por temporadas una semana o un mes o varios este curso no hemos tenido que abrir ninguno
4004761 pa ses como finlandia y suecia han llamado interesados en l as como se han preocupado por otro sistema que nos permite enviar un sms a los m viles de todos los padres si sus hijos a las nueve de la ma ana no han venido a clase
4004762 hoy la mujer trabaja y no acude a dejar ni a recoger a sus hijos como antes tenemos un programa que permite a cualquier padre acceder al historial de su hijo a trav s de internet y encontrar toda la informaci n referente a l sus notas su comportamiento sus faltas etc tera
4004763 este a o se est aplicando en 150 escuelas de seis comunidades aut nomas diferentes castilla le n que es en donde m s implantado est andaluc a la rioja madrid comunidad valenciana y galicia tenemos peticiones que han llegado a trav s una agrupaci n de colegios privados y estamos hablando con alguna administraci n auton mica para instalarlo en m s centros el curso que viene
4004764 no s lo protegemos a los alumnos dentro del aula sino que tambi n fuera todos los centros forman parte del programa llamado ulises que ha puesto en marcha el ayuntamiento de la localidad y que permite conocer si hay maltrato escolar fuera de los centros y actuar en caso necesario mediante la intervenci n r pida de un asistente social que se pone en contacto con los chicos y con las familias implicadas
4004765 ahora la violencia verbal directa insultos burlas se da en todas las edades pero a medida que van creciendo se transforma en m s indirecta murmuraci n
4004766 se incrementa el esconder o romperse los tiles u otras pertenencias
4004767 las v ctimas hoy son atacadas cara a cara dentro de la escuela y tambi n fuera de ella a trav s de las nuevas tecnolog as que hoy est n a disposici n de los chicos
4004768 el maltrato y formas de violencia indirecta mediante sms correos electr nicos an nimos p ginas web difamatorias o que alojan videos youtube son cada vez m s habituales y se han convertido en una de las armas preferidas por los abusadores o acosadores a la hora de burlarse atemorizar o en definitiva buscar la forma de da ar a sus compa eros
4004769 el efecto en las v ctimas var a en algunas es m nimo el ataque les resulta indiferente en otras es traum tico dejan de ir al colegio y si los ataques aumentan intentan cambiar de escuela sufren depresiones y lamentablemente tambi n conocemos casos de suicidio
4004770 saya memang belum membaca surat larangan tersebut karena hal itu merupakan kewenangan kepala lp batu
4004771 larangan ini tidak hanya berlaku selama bulan agustus tetapi untuk seterusnya
4004772 selain itu jika masyarakat mengetahui ada sesuatu yang mencurigakan mereka pasti akan melapor
4004773 he said the problem was he was running to catch a ball and he was either going to run into it or jump over it
4004774 so he decided that to jump over it was probably less stressful for him
4004775 were at the stage now where we cant play with 24 players for very long
4004776 sometimes guys dont let me run theyre slide stepping and throwing a lot more fastballs but the guys behind me are getting better pitches to hit which helps
4004777 thats what i really thrive on stealing bases when they know youre going
4004778 i want to run and you can see me jumping so bad because i want to go
4004779 we dont feel like were going to start losing because theyre gone
4004780 were going to miss them for sure but well be fine
4004781 my major concern is not necessarily the loss of longo and carl right now its the continuation of pitching well and catching the ball on defense and just purely playing the game hard
4004782 we set our price where we think it was fair given all considerations of the various issues
4004783 we do what we think is appropriate in order to have 47 000 affordable seats we had to have 4 500 expensive seats
4004784 they flashed his photo on the jumbotron announced it was his first major league at bat
4004785 when i came in and got my glove i was running on the field and jermaine dye was with me and i told him that i hope i can throw the ball and i happened to get it
4004786 when he got the hit it was the same feeling i had when he struck out the grand ledge kid to win the state championship 2001 we were just going nuts
4004787 what i get irritated about is they have tournaments on mothers day or fathers day
4004788 i may sound crazy saying im doing this so my son can play high school ball and then college ball and maybe move on from there but were devoted to our kids
4004789 not only are kids getting into it earlier but theres a huge market with pitching hitting speed and agility lessons
4004790 in the last 10 years or so we have seen a noticeable difference in the number of younger kids 8 and 9 years old playing travel ball
4004791 i guarantee you i spent 15 000 hotels gas food all kinds of things ive got 1 000 in bats but i love it
4004792 to a certain extent its been going on quite some time but it is getting younger and younger and im not so sure thats good
4004793 there is no way you can protect those kids arms
4004794 the first thing that you will notice is that i am a team player
4004795 i am an emotional guy that will do whatever it takes to win i bring intensity and will give you 150 percent every night plus i made the transition from a post to a guard so you know i am guaranteed to work on my game i can shoot the lights out from the mid range fifteen feet and in is cash money you might as well go ahead and get back on defense
4004796 the first thing that sticks out about roger franklin is his consistency
4004797 night in and night out you know he is going to hit the glass knock down mid range jumpers and play defense hes the ultimate glue guy hes expanded his game to the point where he can play on the wing full time he brings a lot of attributes to the table but his biggest goal every time out is to get the victory every college program needs a tough hard nosed guy like him that will do whatever it takes to win
4004798 if you go back to seventh grade i think his record is 130 something wins and only eight losses
4004799 he went undefeated two years in middle school the kid is just a winner
4004800 i have been talking to michigan state assistant mark montgomery a lot
4004801 i have also talked to coach izzo a couple of times and roger has talked to them too michigan state has pretty much come up i am going to round it to a top three and say that michigan state will be in that top three
4004802 they came on kind of late but theyre a basketball powerhouse i know who coach izzo is he is a very intense coach that wants what is best for his players he has a great coaching staff and one thing that coach izzo does is he develops players he helps players get to that next level he has great connections i just know that coach izzo is going to be one of the those coaches that if you play for him you are guaranteed to not only leave as a better player but also as a better man
4004803 it is kind of like a neutral deal because we have family in michigan but were in texas
4004804 were only three hours from oklahoma hes got family here and family there wherever he goes everything is all good
4004805 i am going to try to take all five of my officials
4004806 indiana just got tom crean a great coach from marquette he is a guy that is going to push his kids arizona is also a good school they have been there in his recruitment from the get go i have been to their elite camp and i have a great relationship with all the coaches oklahoma is very close to home and that is just a little bit of an edge for them and oklahoma state is rebuilding but i know they are a producer of great players and i know that players get treated very well there they have been on me since the beginning of this year even when they switched coaching staffs i still had my offer
4004807 its going to come down to the coach the graduation rate and the living arrangement
4004808 roger isnt one of these guys getting into the hype of i am one and done he is a guy that wants to get a college degree because he knows that in a blink of an eye his career could be over
4004809 this is really a special time for everyone in the michigan family
4004810 and to see our swimmers perform at that level is amazing
4004811 watching michael phelps and peter vanderkaay set an unbelievable benchmark and win the gold medal gave me a feeling of pride not only for our athletic department and the university of michigan but for our nation
4004812 thats what the olympics is all about and thats why this is such a special time for our sports
4004813 we are a very competitive football team and we are not going to get into any specifics but that is the way competitors are it has been a long training camp and today is really the last day we are just ready to start seeing other people on a weekly basis
4004814 the extracurricular i dont want that but i understand guys standing up for each other well be a good team
4004815 weve learned to work hard and work smart you usually dont go seven days without a game this is our seventh day and we still have four or three more days until we play guys are just ready to hit somebody else
4004816 this is what i like the most about it three weeks into training camp and guys are still competitive and guys are still enthused about coming here
4004817 every year you got different players on the team this year what you see is what it is
4004818 it is violent emotions are going to run high at times it is going to happen that is part of it now you are not going to see altercations and things like that all the time but it is supposed to be spirited it is supposed to be intense that is the nature of the business
4004819 we have to play better i know we played some pretty good teams but were going to have to beat the good teams if were going to be able to get to the playoffs
4004820 it seemed like he had an easy time with us and nobody should have an easy time with us
4004821 there are just so many hitters that can go up there and hit the ball out of the ballpark
4004822 i was trying to be a hero i could have ended my career
4004823 no problem with the rotator cuff or elbow or shoulder
4004824 it could be next year im not gonna even pick up a ball for 12 days
4004825 subconsciously we all pretty much know that if the offense isnt getting it going we have to be the rock
4004826 as far as the guys we have here they are competing
4004827 weve got a lot of guys who are really doing a good job and are trying to improve every day
4004828 i really believe in my heart and you are starting to see some of this that we are in a better situation than we were a year ago and we are going to continue to grow
4004829 you get out there and you get used to banging
4004830 do you guys really have cotton in your ear or what it was just a little music before the practice to loosen them up
4004831 its dangerous because were playing just good enough to get beat and thats not good at all
4004832 i want to emphasize effort is not a problem but sometimes its easy to have a little letdown when it looks like things are slipping away a bit
4004833 a little bunt a bad hop kind of a freak inning
4004834 it was a weird outing for kenny because he pitched well
4004835 theres been a little problem there lately i dont understand it i dont know if it gets hard there or what but it looked like a double play ball and turned into a bad hop single
4004836 i was able to see over the fence and she was running away at that point
4004837 it was a prolonged attack with about 20 knife wounds one pierced the right lung one penetrated the left lung one went into her throat and just missed the artery there
4004838 he wrapped a towel around her hes a big man and just the pressure of him holding her kept her from bleeding out
4004839 just remind her were all with her and sad and hoping she gets better
4004840 she was just hanging there just trying to hold on
4004841 im really surprised that he was able to do that
4004842 esto representa el primer s ntoma del declive de los estados unidos como potencia hegem nica sitio que merecen ocupar los chinos
4004843 unvergebenheit ist wie gift trinken und erwarten dass der andere stirbt
4004844 modern images of native americans the art of fritz scholder
4004845 art of africa objects from the collection of warren robbins
4004846 stitches of devotion the quilts and coverlets of elkhart county
4004847 its not age per se that when you get to 80 its all over with
4004848 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
4004849 if sexual health goes to hell it may be a canary in the mine shaft it may be a sign of health problems
4004850 anxiety is very clearly a big factor in sexual dysfunction for women and depression in men
4004851 and men can become very depressed because of sexual dysfunction
4004852 i can only control what i do on the mound
4004853 we had a couple of games earlier when they scored 14 15 runs for me thats the way baseball goes sometimes
4004854 it feels good to get the first hit out of the way and contribute
4004855 were going to have to get runners over tonight we had a runner on second and didnt advance him a first and third situation and didnt advance him we dont have a lot of home runs on the team so our situational hitting has to improve
4004856 the paris declaration has helped shape international aid and development over the past three years it has proved extremely important in bringing together the needs of developing countries to have greater ownership with the needs of donors for better accountability on the ground
4004857 but the pace of progress remains too slow now it is time for developing countries and donors to take responsibility for accelerating action
4004858 told the police investigator that krial had hired him to sell porn and run his staunton store
4004859 hes now told the jury an alleged statement by embrey not subject to cross examination
4004860 but i dont know whats going to happen if you dont have the evidence you say youre going to have
4004861 what is the relationship between what the store looked like on the 29th to what it was on the 15th
4004862 are you going to introduce evidence that the store looked different two weeks later
4004863 if its an accurate portrayal of what the store looked like on the 15th ill allow it
4004864 deep throat the devil and miss jones or debbie does dallas
4004865 dont tell me that these movies arent the same type of movie
4004866 i said to myself i own these call numbers in perpetuity and i paid a lot of money for them
4004867 im fond of the idea of young people submitting videos
4004868 the average is now 50 years there is no defined demographic for the internet it runs the gamut
4004869 hes always been ahead of the curve with charlottesville tomorrow
4004870 i would hope we could stream them because they cover every doggone meeting in the county
4004871 theres so little video right now i presume theres not much demand maybe denny king can create a market
4004872 i can already make videos that no one will see buried in the bowels of youtube
4004873 a lot of people are going to sit down and watch a three hour board of supervisors meeting
4004874 if you hack out three minutes of debate that would be great
4004875 i think his idea to launch a local only content web station is a great idea
4004876 the police department of zhejiang province investigated and verified that tang yongmings armed attack in gulou beijing dongcheng district was an individual act of extreme behaviour caused by his being depressed
4004877 may attempt to stage an incident perhaps even one involving violence and then label the actors as falun gong practitioners
4004878 over the past nine years the ccp has used a variety of inaccurate labels on falun gong
4004879 in each case the aim has been to vilify people who practice falun gong and therefore justify the horrors these people are subject to under ccp rule
4004880 providing e mail updates of his activities before and after the big night media interviews visits with the virginia delegates and backstage moments at the big event you name it
4004881 so i knew he was going to give me a run or two the guys came through and scored the runs to help me relax
4004882 it was amazing that our teams went out there and finished in the top half and top third against the biggest and best programs in the country
4004883 they went out there and won three competitive games we had a wonderful group of young guys with good speed and a great enthusiasm for the game
4004884 they really did a great job showing that they could play with these teams
4004885 you look at their speed and athleticism and its really impressive

4004888 comment se porte mon bon monsieur cette gracieuse m lancolie
4004889 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4004890 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4004891 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4004892 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4004893 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4004894 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4004895 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4004896 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4004897 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4004898 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4004899 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4004900 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4004901 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4004902 we are putting the people and the systems in place that would allow us to run a public company
4004903 or to continue to thrive as a standalone entity as we are today
4004904 were going to do whatever we can to keep a job base in canada
4004905 we make a big product and that will cost an increasing amount of money to move it from an asian source
4004906 no one can afford to miss the musings of the chatty jancis
4004907 we discovered that it was ok to have a little high brow as long you have a lot of low brow thats entertainment value the one thing you want to avoid is the middle brow because the whole world is frigging middle brow at the moment
4004908 gotta get these motherfucking snakes out of this motherfucking caldron
4004909 you have a half hour to eat as much of this as possible
4004910 for ten minutes i liked it but when i read the lyrics i thought it was sad i would like to invite her here i feel sympathetic to people like her
4004911 she could stay a week or two and discuss the big questions of life faith might be an answer for her
4004912 filosofia din scoli a unei generatii va deveni filosofia unui guvern in generatia urmatoare
4004913 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favourites again to win the premier league but regarding arsenal they also have a great team but im not sure if the group have enough experience and quality to win
4004914 i see nobody else to win the premier league but tottenham surely have the quality to fight for a top four finish
4004915 i cannot really say who the surprise team will be but year after year we always wait for a better newcastle
4004916 they are a top club they have huge support and they have good players so we wait for more from them
4004917 phil scolari has not made a lot of changes since he arrived at the club
4004918 he has kept the same structure the same system and the same football he is a good leader and he can do very well
4004919 the only insight or advice i would give him ahead of his first season is that he is in a club that is ready to win
4004920 a varmint will never quit ever theyre like the viet cong

4004927 avneet needs experience and think she was not prepared enough of course none expected her to win a medal but she was not in the best shape of her shooting career and it was a very okay sort of performance
4004928 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences
4004929 the ministry of finance has passed an order for acquiring of state bank of saurashtra sbs by state bank of india
4004930 date as may be notified by the govt of india in the official gazette
4004931 its been a fairytale journey for me this medal represents the heart and soul of the team no one thought we could win a medal
4004932 but deep down we knew we could do and we never doubted ourself
4004933 there is no temptation except that which is common to man
4004934 god has given you this ministry because you cant handle anything more than this youre just a food courier to a few people god gives the important successful people ministries which reach thousands you have a ministry that reaches hundreds at best maybe dozens you are a small man with small faith and few gifts
4004935 i am here because i care and i can hack the heat and the bumps and other people want easy ministry assignments and they would never make it here and they want the spotlight and i am humble and and and
4004936 does he not leave the ninety nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying
4004937 the assessment of his evidence is the matter for the jury
4004938 it would be extremely dangerous for you to reach a conviction on his evidence unless you are convinced his evidence is supported by other evidence
4004939 the next targets were the nab cup and the crown casino on the grand prix weekend 2006
4004940 its a conversation relied to you by a liar where there is no other support
4004941 they informed me that there is reason to suspect that a crime may have been committed involving the disclosure of official secrets
4004942 following this meeting i spoke with the police commissioner and he has voluntarily stepped aside from his position while the investigation is undertaken
4004943 i am not making any judgment about the veracity of the allegations against him but his decision is clearly the most proper response to these circumstances
4004944 obviously thats a little harder to police when people are in private apartments but people shouldnt take any comfort from that
4004945 if police can identify you they can make a charge
4004946 you can have a lot of fun without turning off international visitors and spectators
4004947 theres plenty of room for fun and i think we can do that without crossing the line into a place where maybe mums and dads dont feel good about bringing their children here
4004948 the safety issue especially with overcrowded balconies is a real concern for us
4004949 and we want to ensure the behaviour in general is appropriate for the event
4004950 in the past there have been parts of the crowd which probably get a little too carried away
4004951 ultimately what happens in a building is the responsibility of the building manager or owner
4004952 at the end of the day weve just got to make sure the event is suitable for all ages and groups
4004953 the arkaroola sanctuary should be off limits for exploration and mining
4004954 the rann government should simply ban all exploration and mining at arkaroola so future generations can be assured of the opportunity to enjoy this magnificent area of our state
4004955 the completion of the rectification plan will enable us to take the next steps towards seeking the necessary approvals to recommence our drilling program
4004956 clearly it was inappropriate we understand the team has apologised and absolutely meant no offence whatsoever
4004957 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4004958 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4004959 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
4004960 one thing about greg inglis is hes a loyal kid hes very important to what we do
4004961 ive played with greg for a long time hes very respectable hes very loyal and hes very much loved among this bunch of blokes at the storm
4004962 im sure hell make the right choice for him and hopefully thats with rugby league and particularly with the storm because hes valuable to what we do and hes a good bloke too
4004963 a matter of great pleasure for me to convey my warm felicitations to you and the people of india
4004964 let me take this opportunity to reiterate my governments commitment to improve relations with india by resolving all outstanding disputes between the two countries in a just and peaceful manner
4004965 the curfew will continue we will review the security situation later today and take necessary measure accordingly
4004966 situation is tense but under control no untoward incident was reported during the last 24 hours in the district
4004967 senior citizens are likely to take out a peace procession to bring down the tempers among both the communities
4004968 however there were no violent clashes with police or army at any place there were no violent protests
4004969 last years contract negotiations were messy because of perhaps the people who were involved because of what was or what wasnt written in the contract and needed to be done at a certain date and was allowed to roll on
4004970 ive spoken to eugene arocca and ive spoken to james brayshaw this week and im sure that things will or wont get sorted out but my main concern is winning games of footy right now
4004971 i just think it is important for everyone at the footy club to focus on what were doing now
4004972 if we can complete out task against carlton this weekend we play in a finals series
4004973 im sure if you asked 15 other clubs they would have an interest in jess smith
4004974 what i was staggered about was the article said he was uncontracted which is completely untrue
4004975 he is contracted until the next year hes not going anywhere
4004976 theyre a completely different side to anything that weve come up against in the previous carlton sides
4004977 theyve got a different coach different coaching panel they play a hell of a lot differently so i wouldnt have thought past history will have much to do with sunday afternoon
4004978 it is a pretty big trip i know when i was at the bulldogs just going to the airport and having to go through customs and sort of a three and a half hour flight is very different to what you are normally used to
4004979 particularly if you are a sydney team you only probably have two or three trips in the whole year where you go away if it is auckland it is a long way to go
4004980 the weather conditions dont always seem to be what the away teams enjoy it is very different it is cold it is windy it is wet
4004981 the crowd is quite intimidating it is a very parochial crowd and it is very close
4004982 at home the team feels they are accepted and supported on the one hand and on the other hand they want to prove themselves to their home crowd
4004983 i guess they put up their best effort because they are in front of people who know and love them
4004984 it is always better to play at home like you feel familiar and the crowd are with you and you sleep in your own bed and that sort of stuff
4004985 i have never imagined that i could win the gold in the olympic games
4004986 my first thought after i touched the wall was wow ive won an olympic final
4004987 its a new generation and now its time to step aside
4004988 the best moment is when i turned back and i saw the number one next to my name
4004989 its huge unbelievable at any moment i felt that i could be beaten
4004990 i think medals mean more than times so thats what im going to be focusing on over the next three days
4004991 no doubt thats a combination with the players also they perform well at the end of the year and they go into pre season feeling better
4004992 so if our supporters see a great game friday and then the following week against melbourne it gives them a bit of hope to where were going next year
4004993 our effort needs to be a lot greater than it was last week probably more like the way it was against st kilda were looking for that kind of effort and that kind of contested football
4004994 collingwood pride themselves on that and if we can do that a lot better and match them our skill level and talent should be able to get us a win
4004995 effort is the biggest thing its what every individual controls our leaders control and the coaches do what we can control so thats what were looking at and were hoping a little bit of michael wilson rubs off on everyone on a friday night
4004996 very high threat of terrorist attack sectarian violence and the unpredictable security situation
4004997 recent credible information indicates terrorists are planning attacks against targets in karachi
4004998 des igf sind jeweils auf freiwilliger basis alle drei gruppen von betroffenen neudeutsch stakeholdergruppen genannt vertreten regierungen privatwirtschaft und zivilgesellschaft
4004999 i felt tired before the competition but after it i feel relaxed
4005000 i thought a month ago if i would get this medal i would be every emotional
4005001 but im really not because we won the team gold medal
4005002 but he handled it like a champion and i respect him very much
4005003 obviously thats a little harder to police when people are in private apartments but people shouldnt take any comfort from that
4005004 if police can identify you they can make a charge
4005005 you can have a lot of fun without turning off international visitors and spectators
4005006 theres plenty of room for fun and i think we can do that without crossing the line into a place where maybe mums and dads dont feel good about bringing their children here
4005007 the safety issue especially with overcrowded balconies is a real concern for us
4005008 and we want to ensure the behaviour in general is appropriate for the event
4005009 in the past there have been parts of the crowd which probably get a little too carried away
4005010 ultimately what happens in a building is the responsibility of the building manager or owner

4005016 hungary takes stand in uproar over russian invasion of georgia
4005017 my only issue is that there are only two aides for the school and its a pretty big school im wondering if theyll be able to handle the load
4005018 my claim is still pending with the va in honolulu the regional office with this resolution its about time it is in the right direction to bring or to establish an office right here on guam so that veterans like myself can go in there and talk to them on a one on one basis and be heard
4005019 our veterans feel that we need someone we can talk to thats really handling our claims and to be three thousand miles away is not cutting it
4005020 hungary takes stand in uproar over russian invasion of georgia

4005026 yes perl is ugly and yes i wouldve dumped it if i only could and yes i feel like gorging my eyes out every time i use it but those damn perl hackers just filled cpan with so much stuff that i cant
4005027 perl is bad but cpan makes it worth your while
4005028 fell below the standard of care expected of an er physician
4005029 fill the moat with the corpses of your comrades trample on their broken carcasses to reach the ramparts bring down the walls with the weight of the dead
4005030 its a bit like the slice of ham in a vertical ham sandwich
4005031 we leave the white bread and take out the ham from the middle its sort of a thin sliver running through the rock here in a tonne of rock you will probably produce enough gold to make a normal style wedding band
4005032 weve a number of occurrences that we know about at the moment and our exploration effort will be devoted to developing those and see whether those could be economic
4005033 this isnt a wilderness type of park its a managed landscape
4005034 gold isnt something you find every day we recognise the uniqueness of this so were certainly looking at it in as positive a way as we can
4005035 its definitely not on the front page of the sports section
4005036 it was great i was rooting for people that i knew
4005037 he realized that with the smaller field softball is actually much faster than baseball
4005038 everybody practices hard and wants to do their best but sometimes somebody else is a little bit better
4005039 so you go back and practice harder and make yourself better the next time around
4005040 the contenders will be sparring at a level theyre not used to seeing

4005249 fords panther line of cars which consists of the crown victoria lincoln town car and grand marquis is designed with the fuel tank located outside the protection of the rear axle and within the cars
4005250 to start it place the transmission shift lever in the
4005251 yeah i know it sounds crazy but i think we can make it work
4005252 drive ahead of my actual position because only the brakes worked immediately
4005253 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4005254 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4005255 i heard that he was doing well and hes healthy were just interested in what the charges are
4005256 but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4005257 kevin is all for everything he wants her to have 50 50 custody he wants them to raise these kids together kevins heart is right
4005258 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4005259 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit
4005260 but it was really cool and she was happy when she got to the hospital we all thought it was going to be an all day thing and instead the baby just sort of popped out ok were happy now
4005261 its wonderful the relationship is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
4005262 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir
4005263 has turned his life around becoming a model of rehabilitation and service to others
4005264 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4005265 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4005266 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4005267 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4005268 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4005269 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4005270 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4005271 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4005272 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4005273 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4005274 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4005275 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4005276 when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you for example ryan howard is from st louis st louis it seems like they support their team theyre encouraging
4005277 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4005278 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4005279 its a great country and its a unique country its a rugby destination and its a place where you test yourself because they are the original rugby nation for a rugby player and coach theres nothing better than that
4005280 this summer the most beloved swamp dwelling ogre of all time will make his theatrical debut in the world premiere of shrek the musical at the 5th avenue theatre this all new production is based on shreks adventures in the classic william steig book and oscar winning film joining shrek on his journey from the swamp to the stage will be his wisecracking sidekick donkey princess fiona lord farquaad and a chorus of everybodys favorite fairytale creatures
4005281 the mayors office of arts amp cultural affairs hosts free lunchtime concerts at city hall good acoustics family friendly and audience members are encouraged to bring along a lunch
4005282 leave her alone we are not allowed to kill her
4005283 i look different but i know you know its me
4005284 because you made my boyfriend go insane he was never himself after you and your friends put charlie away i loved him but he was so interested in getting back it was never the same and of course you should pay for the time i lost with him
4005285 its charlies if it wasnt for him being the way he was he would have never gone to jail he hit her and beat her if it wasnt for me that night he would have raped her
4005286 maybe she deserved it she never did what was told
4005287 stormi how could you we love you like our own sister why are you doing this
4005288 because you played a part in it and should also be punished
4005289 they informed me that there is reason to suspect that a crime may have been committed involving the disclosure of official secrets
4005290 following this meeting i spoke with the police commissioner and he has voluntarily stepped aside from his position while the investigation is undertaken
4005291 i am not making any judgment about the veracity of the allegations against him but his decision is clearly the most proper response to these circumstances
4005292 the arkaroola sanctuary should be off limits for exploration and mining
4005293 the rann government should simply ban all exploration and mining at arkaroola so future generations can be assured of the opportunity to enjoy this magnificent area of our state
4005294 it is a pretty big trip i know when i was at the bulldogs just going to the airport and having to go through customs and sort of a three and a half hour flight is very different to what you are normally used to
4005295 particularly if you are a sydney team you only probably have two or three trips in the whole year where you go away if it is auckland it is a long way to go
4005296 the weather conditions dont always seem to be what the away teams enjoy it is very different it is cold it is windy it is wet
4005297 the crowd is quite intimidating it is a very parochial crowd and it is very close
4005298 at home the team feels they are accepted and supported on the one hand and on the other hand they want to prove themselves to their home crowd
4005299 i guess they put up their best effort because they are in front of people who know and love them
4005300 it is always better to play at home like you feel familiar and the crowd are with you and you sleep in your own bed and that sort of stuff
4005301 obviously thats a little harder to police when people are in private apartments but people shouldnt take any comfort from that
4005302 if police can identify you they can make a charge
4005303 you can have a lot of fun without turning off international visitors and spectators
4005304 theres plenty of room for fun and i think we can do that without crossing the line into a place where maybe mums and dads dont feel good about bringing their children here
4005305 the safety issue especially with overcrowded balconies is a real concern for us
4005306 and we want to ensure the behaviour in general is appropriate for the event
4005307 in the past there have been parts of the crowd which probably get a little too carried away
4005308 ultimately what happens in a building is the responsibility of the building manager or owner
4005309 clearly it was inappropriate we understand the team has apologised and absolutely meant no offence whatsoever
4005310 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4005311 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4005312 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
4005313 one thing about greg inglis is hes a loyal kid hes very important to what we do
4005314 ive played with greg for a long time hes very respectable hes very loyal and hes very much loved among this bunch of blokes at the storm
4005315 im sure hell make the right choice for him and hopefully thats with rugby league and particularly with the storm because hes valuable to what we do and hes a good bloke too
4005316 i have never imagined that i could win the gold in the olympic games
4005317 my first thought after i touched the wall was wow ive won an olympic final
4005318 its a new generation and now its time to step aside
4005319 the best moment is when i turned back and i saw the number one next to my name
4005320 its huge unbelievable at any moment i felt that i could be beaten
4005321 i think medals mean more than times so thats what im going to be focusing on over the next three days
4005322 very high threat of terrorist attack sectarian violence and the unpredictable security situation
4005323 recent credible information indicates terrorists are planning attacks against targets in karachi
4005324 no doubt thats a combination with the players also they perform well at the end of the year and they go into pre season feeling better
4005325 so if our supporters see a great game friday and then the following week against melbourne it gives them a bit of hope to where were going next year
4005326 our effort needs to be a lot greater than it was last week probably more like the way it was against st kilda were looking for that kind of effort and that kind of contested football
4005327 collingwood pride themselves on that and if we can do that a lot better and match them our skill level and talent should be able to get us a win
4005328 last years contract negotiations were messy because of perhaps the people who were involved because of what was or what wasnt written in the contract and needed to be done at a certain date and was allowed to roll on
4005329 ive spoken to eugene arocca and ive spoken to james brayshaw this week and im sure that things will or wont get sorted out but my main concern is winning games of footy right now
4005330 i just think it is important for everyone at the footy club to focus on what were doing now
4005331 if we can complete out task against carlton this weekend we play in a finals series
4005332 im sure if you asked 15 other clubs they would have an interest in jess smith
4005333 what i was staggered about was the article said he was uncontracted which is completely untrue
4005334 he is contracted until the next year hes not going anywhere
4005335 theyre a completely different side to anything that weve come up against in the previous carlton sides
4005336 we will channelise trickles of resources from individual donors and make a meaningful difference to the not so fortunate sections of society through social service organizations we will strive to satisfy existing and emerging needs of both donors and customers
4005337 have patience just because its slow doesnt santha devi selvaraj mean its not happening
4005338 visits to anbu karangal ak has always been one of my favourites not because it sivakumar thulasiram is near my house but because of the energy levels of this ngos inmates right sivanandam from 3 year old to 70 year old the inmates always welcome us with a pleasant balakrishnan smile somasundaram soosairaj p when we entered ak all the inmates were busy watching a movie we didnt want srinivasaraghavan sd to disturb them so we silently sat behind but slowly one by one they started to sriram m sriram sk gather around us the feeling when the kids hold our hands wrap their hands subashree raghavan around our legs peep into our mobile phones lean against our chairs well it sudhakar n sudhir is an experience that cant be explained in words but can only be felt sudhir pidugu sujatha mahalakshmi sujatha for that moment vishnu venkatesh amp sadiq were the heroes for the kids rajasekar reddy though divya doesnt know tamil she was able to understand them to an extent sukumar sultan the kids were so surprised to know that her name was divya immediately they sumana sundaresan went searching for the divya in ak to show her to us sumitha sumithra robertson sundar g so far was the talking and laughing part then the kids wanted to play vishnu suparna ks surender venkatesh amp sadiq tried their level best to match the energy of the kids im sure b surendra babu divya wouldve had leg pain the next day the kids took turns climbing over her suresh masa toes and asking her to lift them thillairajan thyagarajan g vagish we left with a satisfaction of having brought smiles in the faces of the unfortunate a vasanth venkat few the kind of satisfaction you dont recieve drinking coffee at cafe coffee day or venkatesan ks eating at marry brown as a bridger im proud that im able to provide the venkatesh vidya g personal touch in addition to the monetary touch r u
4005339 the visit was really a very nice experience spending time with the kids was umapathy viji gandhi really great though i wish i could speak tamil and interact more and thanks for viji prabhu vinaya briefing me about bridge and how it works i would like to join and contribute more vinayak as my job permits
4005340 reached aruwe at 15 hrs amp inmates were relaxing their afternoon initial response from inmates was quite poor towards us then we took initiative to break the ice we introduced ourselves to all inmates and asked them to introduce themselves with their name and their place of origin everybody responded well and some people were shy in speaking still they continued we asked them to sing few songs initially there was only few participation we made a point that we will appreciate each one who sings a song and in next 45 mins there was a tremendous change we can able to see 99 participation now the turn has come to us all of them were asking us to sing it was quite surprising and joyful to us we started singing songs individually amp together they applauded us sreevalsan with his song made everybody happy there was a continuous celebration amp happiness moments meanwhile sangeeta amp sindhu joined us all paatis were now asking them to sing they also participated in a well manner made their and our memories a memorable one yes we thought it could be around 4 30pm no it was around 6 clock runs fast when we are enjoying amp celebrating yes time amp tide waits for none its time to say bye to them everybody waved their hands and asked us when we will come back again to see them we came back with the satisfaction of bringing joy amp celebration in wrinkled faces yes happiness amp joy doubles when you share with others
4005341 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4005342 its because of his personal problems his personal disease he was not involved in any accident he suddenly collapsed
4005343 but somehow they knew about it the sbma came to hanjin on tuesday
4005344 they could not find anything wrong about hanjin or its subcontractor and the way he de la cruz was working
4005345 there is no road too long for the person who treads lightly and without haste there is no dathan i always enjoy reading your blog best of luck in the marathon i will be cheering for you mr monti im flattered to see that you used my translation of noguchis comments in your

4005347 there is no road too long for the person who treads lightly and without haste there is no dathan i always enjoy reading your blog best of luck in the marathon i will be cheering for you mr monti im flattered to see that you used my translation of noguchis comments in your
4005348 the international olympic committee failed to press china to allow fully unfettered access to the internet for the thousands of journalists arriving here to cover the olympics despite
4005349 unfolding humanitarian crisis as a result of fighting in central mindanao
4005350 the secretary general appeals for restraint protection of all civilians as well as access for the provision of speedy humanitarian assistance to the affected population
4005351 wfp fully understands that the situation remains fluid and we will continue to work closely with all concerned to further assess the total number of affected persons and adjust our response accordingly
4005352 we hope for peace so that these families can return to their communities
4005353 we have infused the humanitarian assistance and disaster response mode side by side with clearing operations
4005354 we have progressed we are down to eight barangays from 15 if that rate continues it wont be very long before we conclude the operations
4005355 there are other barangays aside from the original list of 22 that our commanders saw fit and necessary to clear because they were in the vicinity of the area of the operations some of them were the routes of withdrawal of katos renegade group
4005356 we are now conducting mopping up operations to remove the mines and explosives laid by the rebels
4005357 me my wife and four young children stay there waiting for food assistance but we cannot be in this situation for long
4005358 it was so cold at night and so hot at daytime this is how miserable our life has become because of the fighting
4005359 there is no way we can give up on the peace process
4005360 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4005361 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4005362 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4005363 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4005364 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4005365 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4005366 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4005367 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4005368 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4005369 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4005370 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4005371 well what right do you have to speak about them then
4005372 many of us are motivated by a deep disgust with and distrust of the dnc leadership
4005373 there will be no unity in the democratic party until the voices of the 18 million voters who support hillary clinton are heard and heeded until the voices of pumas are once again listened to by the leadership of the democratic party we will be guided by that defiance we will not be bullied brainwashed or bossed into falling in line
4005374 i woke up that morning and said holy smoke theyre not even gonna let her run and compete the obama campaign is gonna sit back and take the benefits of that crap from msnbcs mike barnicle and chris matthews and tucker carlson and maureen dowd and howard dean thats what did it for me
4005375 our goal is to get the dnc to follow the process and let the delegates vote for her nomination
4005376 theres a big difference between a hope and a goal
4005377 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4005378 this is a truly great leader a truly great man a truly inspiring man
4005379 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4005380 once the kids came i kind of semi retired carvey says by phone from a hotel room in los angeles where he is working on the early stages of an upcoming movie comedy for paramount
4005381 i really didnt want to be one of those guys
4005382 squatting monkeys tell no lies which was shot in santa rosa straddles the manic and reflective
4005383 i think when dana was working on his special he kind of fell in love with standup again says cobbs comedy club booker tom sawyer who regularly hired carvey at the club in the 80s
4005384 before he was kind of walking through it and now hes really passionate about it
4005385 i saw a movie and i had him for a day and i lost him it just hits you or it doesnt
4005386 i did snl i did some movies my kids have grown up ive saved a lot of money that will go over good and im having fun
4005387 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4005388 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4005389 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4005390 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4005391 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4005392 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4005393 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4005394 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4005395 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4005396 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how biden is looking more and more possible he is my first choice
4005397 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4005398 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4005399 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4005400 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4005401 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would

4005404 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4005405 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4005406 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4005407 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4005408 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4005409 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4005410 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4005411 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4005412 im not a part of groupthink not part of a trifecta ticket with candidates in the other two districts
4005413 they can call me a spoiler but im in the race to win
4005414 its unconscionable to change your form of government without having actually read the foundation document
4005415 representative democracy made indian river county charter government made miami dade
4005416 i dont want to live in a community where its only open to the wealthiest 1 percent of americans
4005417 i want to live in a community thats open to all americans
4005418 hes ready to take his fight down into the mud
4005419 asks a valid question of whether the relatively inexperienced obama is ready to lead
4005420 oh ya i almost forgot to explain to carolyn and the others out there about
4005421 carolyn al is correct but it goes one step further mr weaver never intended to try and use the vi money for flood releif he wants to put a halt to anything to do with vision iowa and use the 5 8 million dollars that would have been the citys responsability and use it for flood releif
4005422 jb i forgot to mention that the speed limit on all trucks should be reduced to 45m
4005423 carolyn where to you get the idea that max wanted to use vi funds to aid flood victims
4005424 could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not between one candidate thats a talker and one candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president
4005425 clever negative advertising works that is reality the tactic meets with media and pundit disapproval and spawns accusations of negativity but the reality is that a clever negative ad can be devastatingly effective
4005426 youre always more popular before youre actually in charge of things
4005427 in europe the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common
4005428 in america there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europes role in our security and our future both views miss the truth that europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world and that just as american bases built in the last century still help to defend the security of this continent so does our country still sacrifice greatly for freedom around the globe
4005429 we will never again make the mistake of not going to the south and proudly delivering our message
4005430 the democratic partys message will no longer be delivered by rush limbaugh and bill oreilly
4005431 it doesnt mean were going to win all those states
4005432 but at least were making it a contest and giving voters something to choose from
4005433 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
4005434 russias ambassador to nato declared that georgian president mr saakashvili
4005435 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
4005436 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
4005437 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
4005438 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention i understand that
4005439 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the course of his campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention and i wish them all well
4005440 yeah bomb the mess out of them take em over
4005441 going after your opponent for being of the world seemed a bit jarring a bit odd
4005442 their campaign really seems pretty out of touch with what the american people want to see and hear during the olympics
4005443 theyre using a gigantic stage to make their national case against obama
4005444 it doesnt seem to be causing any uproar they may have guessed right
4005445 focused on ensuring that voters have the best information possible to make an informed decision on election day
4005446 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4005447 unlike barack obama harley owners appreciate open roads and open markets
4005448 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4005449 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4005450 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4005451 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4005452 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4005453 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4005454 who will be the next president of the united states
4005455 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4005456 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4005457 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4005458 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4005459 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
4005460 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
4005461 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
4005462 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
4005463 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
4005464 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
4005465 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
4005466 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
4005467 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
4005468 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
4005469 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
4005470 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4005471 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4005472 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4005473 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4005474 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4005475 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4005476 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4005477 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4005478 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4005479 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4005480 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4005481 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4005482 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4005483 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4005484 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4005485 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4005486 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4005487 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4005488 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4005489 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4005490 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4005491 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4005492 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4005493 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4005494 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4005495 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4005496 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4005497 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4005498 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4005499 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4005500 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4005501 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4005502 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4005503 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4005504 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4005505 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4005506 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4005507 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4005508 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4005509 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
4005510 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
4005511 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
4005512 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
4005513 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
4005514 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
4005515 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
4005516 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
4005517 var ett handhavandefel i samband med ett underh llsarbete i ett filter h ndelsen utreds i syfte att ta till sig erfarenheter som kan medverka till att f rebygga liknande incidenter

4005519 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4005520 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4005521 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4005522 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4005523 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4005524 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4005525 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4005526 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
4005527 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
4005528 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
4005529 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
4005530 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
4005531 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
4005532 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
4005533 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
4005534 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
4005535 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4005536 als succes grote belangstelling betekent dan is dit maar n facet maar uiteraard wel een belangrijk vormgeving en mode is zon succesafdeling maar zon studie is meer dan defil s alleen er wordt een enorme technische kennis vereist van de student n creativiteit n kennis van geschiedenis filosofie en dies meer voor indus trieel design stroomt ook veel volk toe omdat we prachtige resultaten boeken op internationale wedstrijden en grafische en visuele communicatie doet het ook al zo goed met prachtige carri res tot gevolg
4005537 toch is succes voor mij ook wat anders de richting boekbinden telt maar tien studenten verspreid over vijf opleidingsjaren die afdeling is vermaard tot in de uithoeken van europa als de directeur van de bibliotheca wittockiana meteen drie boeken koopt van de eindejaarsstudenten 2007 2008 dan betekent dat veel voor onze zeer specialistische opleiding
4005538 met keuzeproblemen tot gevolg als je t veel werk krijgt aangeboden twee jaar geleden studeerde een meisje af in de boekbinderij ze begon aan de lerarenopleiding vastberaden om in het onderwijs te stappen maar ze haakte af overstelpt door werkopdrachten het is maar n voorbeeld
4005539 la cambre heeft de reputatie dat ze rekruteert uit de bourgeoisie al is dat niet voor alle richtingen zo onze studenten industrieel design bijvoorbeeld krijgen aandacht in de internationale pers wat duidt op persoonlijke capaciteiten en op erkenning wij kunnen van dat imago niet af al is het wel ergens begrijpelijk dat in deze wijk tussen louizalaan en ter kamerenbos geen jongeren stranden uit de kunsthumaniora uit een achtergestelde buurt onze schoolpopulatie is trouwens maar voor een deeltje afkomstig uit brussel nog geen twintig procent ze komt een klein beetje meer uit de niet brusselse franse gemeenschap maar de meerderheid komt van elders uit het buitenland en meer en meer krijgen we vlamingen over de vloer iets wat ik van hen heel intelligent vind ze cultiveren er hun taalkennis en culturele veelzijdigheid mee
4005540 het is niet alleen omdat antwerpen de opleiding anders organiseert dat jongeren naar la cambre komen al speelt het wel mee studenten zoeken vandaag bewuster uit hoe ergens onderwezen wordt dat haalt studenten naar hier vanuit frankrijk polen rusland japan buitenlanders vullen daardoor al snel de helft van de instelling brussel trekt als internationale stad om te studeren erg aan studentenlogement blijft hier nog betaalbaar en bovendien bevorderen systemen als het erasmusproject het va et vient
4005541 in een kunstschool welke dan ook moet de culturele diversiteit en de open blik op de kunstwereld centraal staan het maakt dat de verscheidenheid aan onderwijservaringen stijl mode en aanpak leidt tot een interessante voedingsbodem om idee n en kennis op te doen als iedereen zich in de andere herkent of het nu studenten of docenten zijn dan dooft de vlam ik waak erover dat er een grote circulatie van internationale onderwijskrachten aanwezig blijft het cre ert leerrijke shocktoestanden en dat zorgt voor vooruitgang en gedrevenheid
4005542 de school is belgisch omdat ze in brussel staat maar niet omdat het op onze identiteitskaart staat onze afgestudeerden die je carri re in de mode ziet maken komen uit alle contreien wat zij als label op de markt brengen is wel degelijk belgisch n la cambre belgi is altijd een smeltkroes van etnische verscheidenheid geweest wat maakt dat wij hier ander onderwijs aanbieden dan in frankrijk of elders daardoor krijg je het grote verschil dat veel studenten boeit de belgische signatuur wordt weliswaar gegeven door onze vestiging onze traditie ons gedrag tegenover anderen we zijn bijvoorbeeld veel minder competitief dan in frankrijk waar het onderwijs op concurrentie gericht is het maakt ons humaner daarenboven komen onze afgestudeerden op een kunst en arbeidsmarkt terecht die sterk internationaal geori n teerd is en daar bereiden we hen ook op voor ook daarvoor dient het diploma van la cambre
4005543 ik ben in de jaren 1970 aan la cambre afgestudeerd als architect de architectuuropleiding is afgesplitst in 1980 red en ik ben in 2003 aangesteld als directeur de openheid naar de buitenwereld was er toen niet echt ik heb de contacten met wat buiten de instelling gebeurt zowel met bedrijven en lesgevers als contact met andere instellingen in beweging gezet
4005544 ook binnen la cambre wil ik meer beweging tussen de verschillende departementen ik heb in mijn pedagogisch plan crossover masters ingeschreven die veel meer keuze bieden aan de jongeren een ander project is de lerarenopleiding voor jonge artiesten zodat ze in het middelbaar onderwijs les kunnen geven volgend schooljaar proberen we een doctoraal in de kunsten uit te werken in overleg met de universiteit en wat ik echt ambieer voor la cambre al zal ik het niet meer meemaken dat is een netwerk met film dans theater en muziek een soort kunstenuniversiteit de onderhandeling lopen al met partners als het conservatoire de bruxelles de filmschool insas en dansers die samen iets willen opzetten al besef ik dat dat tijd zal vergen in dat opzicht lijkt het onderwijs op een schip op de grote vaart
4005545 brusselaars hier heeft uw boom gestaan de leuvenaars zijn ermee vandoor gegaan
4005546 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4005547 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4005548 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4005549 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4005550 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4005551 just so you all know we did set a record
4005552 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4005553 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4005554 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4005555 han g r v l det han tror r b st
4005556 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4005557 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4005558 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4005559 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4005560 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4005561 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4005562 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4005563 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4005564 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4005565 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4005566 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4005567 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4005568 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4005569 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4005570 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4005571 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4005572 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4005573 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
4005574 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
4005575 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4005576 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4005577 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4005578 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4005579 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4005580 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4005581 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4005582 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4005583 the people of connecticut deserve to have the chance and the choice to vote for ralph nader should that be the candidate of their choice
4005584 he did not help in 2000 and hes not going to this year i guess hes a closet republican he helps elect republicans
4005585 theoretically its always possible for someone to get one vote that could make a difference
4005586 it could go down a little or it could go up a little
4005587 if hes got the support and hes qualified good luck to him
4005588 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
4005589 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
4005590 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
4005591 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
4005592 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
4005593 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
4005594 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4005595 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
4005596 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
4005597 i am proud to have helped found the tahoe summit and the health of lake tahoe and its surrounding areas is hugely important to me
4005598 we have accomplished a lot in the past 11 years but we need to continue work on lake clarity and restoration and implementing the environmental improvement program so we can all enjoy lake tahoe for years to come my thanks to all the parties coming to the table to discuss where we are and where we need to go for the future of the lake
4005599 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4005600 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4005601 real results by the end of my first term in office
4005602 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
4005603 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
4005604 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
4005605 going negative against democrat barack obama isnt just a campaign strategy for republican john mccain
4005606 top the aug 17 new york times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list
4005607 lashes out at barack obama and alleges among other things that the politician has a secret radical islamic agenda
4005608 whether they like him or oppose him readers want to hear more about barack obama
4005609 the author of the million selling dreams from my father and the audacity of hope
4005610 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4005611 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4005612 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4005613 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4005614 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4005615 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4005616 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4005617 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4005618 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4005619 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4005620 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4005621 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4005622 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4005623 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4005624 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4005625 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4005626 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
4005627 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4005628 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4005629 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4005630 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4005631 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4005632 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
4005633 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
4005634 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4005635 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4005636 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4005637 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4005638 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4005639 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4005640 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4005641 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4005642 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4005643 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4005644 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4005645 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4005646 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4005647 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4005648 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4005649 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4005650 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4005651 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
4005652 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
4005653 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
4005654 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
4005655 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
4005656 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
4005657 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
4005658 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
4005659 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
4005660 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
4005661 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
4005662 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
4005663 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
4005664 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
4005665 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
4005666 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
4005667 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
4005668 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
4005669 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
4005670 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
4005671 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
4005672 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
4005673 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
4005674 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
4005675 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4005676 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4005677 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4005678 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4005679 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4005680 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4005681 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4005682 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework

4005691 difficili condizioni in cui versano cittadini sud osseti scappati di fronte ai soldati georgiani
4005692 le terrificanti scene di distruzione in quattro villaggi che erano abitati esclusivamente da georgiani
4005693 la georgia ha denunciato la violazione da parte di mosca della convenzione del 1965 per leliminazione di tutte le forme di discriminazione razziale sottoscritta da entrambi i paesi
4005694 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4005695 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4005696 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4005697 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4005698 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4005699 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent

4005702 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4005703 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4005704 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4005705 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4005706 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4005707 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon

4005711 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4005712 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4005713 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

4005720 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11

4005847 wenn ich tue was mein freund sagt breche ich dann meine eigenen regeln oder das gesetz tue ich jemandem weh den ich respektiere oder lieb habe oder verliert dadurch jemand das vertrauen in mich

4005856 es ist undenkbar da gott den wunsch hat seine kinder zu bestrafen oder sie leid und qual erdulden zu sehen aber was der mensch auch versucht nie kann er den folgen der s nde entrinnen die strafe f r die s nde kommt manchmal erst sp t aber da sie irgendwann einmal wirklichkeit wird ist absolut sicher das wunder der vergebung s 154 155
4005857 wenn unverheiratete der begierde nachgeben haben sie dem k rper die herrschaft einger umt und den geist in ketten gelegt es ist undenkbar da man dies liebe nennen k nnte faith precedes the miracle s 154
4005858 wenn sich zwei menschen lieben und heiraten wollen warum d rfen sie dann noch keinen sexuellen verkehr haben
4005859 liebt er oder sie mich nun um meiner selbst willen oder nur wegen des lustgewinns
4005860 wir werden heiraten wir werden die einzigen sein die je diese beziehungen miteinander eingehen

4005870 t richte berlieferungen die euch verf hren an etwas zu glauben was nicht so ist
4005871 in dieser evangeliumszeit hat der herr das gebot das auf dem sinai gegeben wurde erneut bekr ftigt n mlich du sollst nicht ehebruch begehen und auch sonst nichts derartiges tun
4005872 weil die sexualit t so heilig ist verlangt der herr selbstbeherrschung und reinheit vor der ehe und v llige treue in der ehe betrachtet euren freund bzw eure freundin oder euren ehepartner niemals als objekt eurer l sternen w nsche oder f r eure selbstbest tigung bestimmte verhaltensweisen hat der herr insbesondere verboten dazu geh ren alle sexuellen beziehungen vor der ehe petting perversionen beispielsweise homosexualit t vergewaltigung und blutschande selbstbefriedigung und besch ftigung mit sexuellem verkehr in gedanken wort und tat

4005916 mccain has a good record on that issue abortion and he must show that he will continue it as president
4005917 for mccain the aim will be to solidify evangelicals as a key constituency
4005918 for obama it is significant that he will be participating as an equal on the same stage as mccain in an evangelical church this signals the shift in the evangelical political landscape since 2004
4005919 this has a lot less to do with what is going on in california and more to do with what is going on in ohio pennsylvania and florida the big swing states

4005974 syncserver has encountered a problem and needs to close we are sorry for the inconvenience
4005975 that ruling some acts to be kufr like ruling by other than that which all h has revealed needs evidence that is both qata thab t certain in meaning and qata dal lah certain in narration like a quranic evidence which is certain beyond doubt
4005976 we know from definite evidences mutaw tor that the adulterer and similarly are people of sin and not people of kufr and have therefore not left the millah which contradicts that which the khaw rij had believed who are themselves astray therefore these acts should not be called kufr unless what is meant by that is kufr ungratefulness
4005977 all h will not allow the k fireen to have authority over the muslims
4005978 the one who pronounces takfeer on those who rule by other than that which all h has revealed will open the doors to excessive takfeer which will increase in a successive chain until the one who performs a mere sin will have takfeer pronounced upon him and thus entering him into the hellfire
4005979 the situation of the current day rulers and in particular those who claim are ruling by the shariah is like that of the dynasty of ban umayyah who were unjust tyrants and it is well known that the salaf did not declare them to be k fir
4005980 a many of the rulers who do not rule by that which all h has revealed may have an excuse due to taweel or b an inability to apply the shariah because they fear an attack by the major kufr state or c they are unable to get away from the usury banking systems because the islamic economies are too weak and are unable to confront the international banking systems of the world or d that they are under an immediate occupation by a major kufr state and are being coerced or e most of the rulers are extremely ignorant concerning islamic rulings and their ignorance concerning the islamic rulings is to such a degree that their understanding of the shariah is that it has come to bring benefit and prevent harm therefore the rulings that are imported from the kufr states are perceived as bringing benefit and preventing some harms
4005981 the fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days
4005982 so he started to wipe his eyes saying the kuff r took you and immersed you in water so you said such and such so if they return say that to them again
4005983 except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with
4005984 that the q dthi judge who in principal rules by the shariah but in one individual case rules by other than that which all h has revealed is not commiting the kufr which exits him outside the millah but rather it is kufr d na kufr
4005985 wow if i screw up this time im gonna ruin two lives not just one
4005986 the ay ts of not ruling by that which all h has revealed have come with three attributes so we must conclude that three categories of people are being referred to and for every category one description applies
4005987 i am going to try to play but i still have to see how i feel and what the trainers think

4005996 now i have mc gee hmmmm hes got a great arm and set all kinds of records in high school for passing i know that they know that soooooooo what to do what to doo hmmmm eureka ill have him run the ball more than my running backs genious pure genious wylie coyote has nothing on me

4006136 the united states and the world expect russia to honor that commitment
4006137 i specially checked it with the general staff of the russian armed forces there are no russian servicemen supporting the peacekeeping operation in georgia in poti
4006138 we are not making any secret of that they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled

4006141 we believe the russians are consolidating their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia and will not significantly expand their ground presence in georgia
4006142 we believe the russians will fall back to their pre crisis boundaries we do expect russia to retain a military presence in both enclaves for the long term
4006143 we do see a halt to offensive military operations if there is a formal cease fire we believe the russians will adhere to it while reserving the right to use military force to respond to threats against their troops
4006144 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worst things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country

4006178 the one who hates his brother is in the darkness
4006179 the reason the situation has not been handled better is the spirit of confusion that has been released over that region we know that we do not war against flesh and blood though we cannot expect the government and law enforcement agencies to understand this there is a lot of witchcraft coming from new orleans and it wants to cause as much death as possible we need to pray for this spirit of confusion to be bound and for great clarity and energy to be given to those who are managing and implementing the lifesaving efforts then we need to pray for great clarity and energy to rebuild that city and region this is important for the whole nation
4006180 do you think that these galileans were worse sinners than all the other galileans because they suffered this way 3i tell you no but unless you repent you too will all perish 4or those eighteen who died when the tower in siloam fell on them do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in jerusalem 5i tell you no but unless you repent you too will all perish

4006188 we will be working with former patients and making sure that they understand all of the parts of the court process
4006189 but i think that the general public would understand that there is not taxpayer funds available to assist people who are attending a court case because they are interested in the outcome
4006190 i think it is really a reward for the trade union leaders whove supported us and members who had to make substantial commitments to the future
4006191 they made big decisions in the 80s and 90s which i think has stood the nation in good stead really
4006192 and its a recognition of their contribution rather than me personally
4006193 you dont strive for recognition when you join something like the police force but the recognition is nice and i think it says a lot for the people ive been able to work with

4006208 why would anyone want to join the worlds largest pederast conspiracy
4006209 the effort to embrace and continue the catholic faith was the motivation for embracing protestantism in the time of the reformation or rather the reformations we believe that the efforts on the continent of europe threw away the baby with the bathwater which is why anglicans early on debated with calvinists and lutherans sometimes more vigorously than with rome anglicans debated as well with puritans in england and scottish presbyterians the definition of catholic should be based on its credal use as we use it in the book of common prayer where either the apostles creed or the creed called nicene are part of all the major services article viii combined with that other creed quicunque vult or the creed of st athanasius we say we believe the catholic church and the catholic faith i would indeed place the p of protestantism back in anglicanism to the via media degree required to make it truly patristic and so truly scriptural and truly catholic
4006210 but thus much we must be sure to hold that in the supper of the lord there is no vaine ceremonie no bare signe no vntrue figure of a thing absent matthew 26 26 whereas by the aduice of the councell of nicene we ought to lift vp our mindes by fayth and leauing these inferiour and earthly things there seeke it where the sunne of righteousnesse euer shineth council of nicene concilium take then this lesson o thou that art desirous of this table of emissenus a godly father that when thou goest vp to the reuerend communion to be satisfied with spirituall meates thou looke vp with fayth vpon the holy body and blood of thy god thou maruayle with reuerence thou touch it with the minde thou receiue it with the hand of thy heart and thou take it fully with thy inward man eusebius emissenus serm de euchar
4006211 which might not be a bad thing it might help them see more clearly just what that anglo means and accept that anglicanism is a protestant movement then they can see that the polarity they thought theyd transcended is marked by its two poles for a reason forcing them to choose one or the other i pray my former comrades choose catholicism but if they dont i think they would be happier and more fruitful were they better protestants and thereby oddly enough closer to the catholic church than they are now

4006249 this is the first time the featured artist came out of different category other than painting were really excited about it
4006250 he photographs something familiar and it is offering a new perspective he brings out the detail and interest in them i find that fascinating
4006251 its shot dead center thats a huge no no in photography
4006252 but it sucks you in you wonder where has the train been where is it going you could smell the old and dusty

4006266 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4006267 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4006268 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4006269 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4006270 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4006271 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

4006275 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4006276 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4006277 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4006278 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4006279 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4006280 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4006281 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4006282 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4006283 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4006284 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4006285 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4006286 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4006287 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4006288 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4006289 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4006290 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4006291 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4006292 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

4006297 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4006298 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4006299 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4006301 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4006302 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4006303 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4006304 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4006305 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4006306 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4006307 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4006308 who are open to doing something on the production side
4006309 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4006310 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4006311 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4006312 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4006313 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4006314 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4006315 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4006316 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4006317 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4006318 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4006319 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4006320 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4006321 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4006322 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4006323 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4006324 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4006325 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4006326 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4006327 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4006328 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4006329 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4006330 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4006331 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4006332 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4006333 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4006334 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4006335 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4006336 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4006337 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4006338 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4006339 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4006340 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4006341 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4006342 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4006343 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4006344 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4006345 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4006346 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4006347 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4006348 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4006349 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4006350 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4006351 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4006352 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4006353 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4006354 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4006355 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4006356 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4006357 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4006358 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

4006374 there are some signs the us economy is starting to improve
4006375 it has the ability to reinvent itself and adapt to circumstances quite quickly but one swallow doesnt make a summer
4006376 while it is clearly a time to be cautious the current environment presents well managed banks like cba with opportunities to grow even stronger
4006377 cba delivered on its definition of cash earnings per share growth but it could have been negative growth without the tax benefit and awg
4006378 while these broad trends are clearly evident the duration and extent of the slowdown is more difficult to predict
4006379 please mommy dont ever leave us with those people again

4006383 yeah well i know zimbabwe is run by a brutal dictator and has insane hyperinflation but hey at least they have three medals

4006386 if jonathan calder didnt exist wed probably have to invent him
4006387 i will restate what i have previously stated on one point i learned of the affair only a few weeks ago and had previously presumed that the tabloid stuff was all bogus
4006388 the most shocking thing was seeing him on tv give these half truths these half baked answers
4006389 i wish for the well being of everybody involved you know both families i wish he would have just come clean
4006390 rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to conduct a normal life
4006391 i signed papers because it was papers i had to sign in order to get treated
4006392 this is not presented as a take it or leave it basis
4006393 its definitely not on the front page of the sports section
4006394 it was great i was rooting for people that i knew
4006395 he realized that with the smaller field softball is actually much faster than baseball
4006396 everybody practices hard and wants to do their best but sometimes somebody else is a little bit better
4006397 so you go back and practice harder and make yourself better the next time around
4006398 the contenders will be sparring at a level theyre not used to seeing
4006399 i think its a matter especially with football players of being jocks or tough i dont know if they think its a sign of weakness getting water its hard to know where the breakdown is happening
4006400 he didnt have the chance to do his regular routine with gatorade and water gatorade and water
4006401 that had been under control it had gotten better each year that he played football
4006402 its tricky but if you have the medication to reduce the inflammation and their lung function is as good as a normal person you can let them be active
4006403 that was his dream to be able to go there whether he played football or not
4006404 he was just a great son we loved him dearly hes going to be truly missed
4006405 no one who knew atlas can say that they couldnt see the potential he had
4006406 he was just a funny guy its going to be tough without him
4006407 he was a young man who was a class act very well liked
4006408 something like this reminds everyone that sports arent always whats important family is more important
4006409 the bills just throw the attack up in your face over and over again and make it that much harder for the wounds to heal
4006410 we have some concerns whether it will cover the actual costs
4006411 im talking to you on a cell phone using lithium batteries
4006412 its amazing how weve tapped into the imagination of young people a number of retired nasa graybeards have contacted us but most are in their 20s literally hundreds of people have sent in resumes
4006413 we have to have people with different areas of expertise
4006414 thats not the danger thats the benefit imagine having fedex say they delivered the first package to the moon
4006415 we have tremendous technology the state already has a significant presence in the aerospace industry nasa is watching this closely because as we look to the future theyll likely want to do a lot of outsourcing
4006416 would be a great benefit to n c state university
4006417 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4006418 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4006419 its very emotional to think about the things these children have survived
4006420 the children had to have a big drama but had to be healthy
4006421 i can think of no justifiable reason why the former nccu leadership would have completely ignored and failed to abide by the appropriate approval process in creating this program such action is contrary to all university policy to say the least it is very disappointing
4006422 bishop long and i didnt talk about the establishment of this program
4006423 we saw it as an opportunity to partner with bishop eddie long and also to provide educational opportunities in what would have been a new market to n c central university
4006424 it means that we cannot afford to put water lines on those roads or along some sections of roads
4006425 the big risk is that down the road you may need public water and it wont be there
4006426 it wont get any cheaper than 500 to tap onto the system
4006427 however the 500 fee must be paid by sept 10 and we also must receive a completed water service application by then
4006428 i support conservation and deep sea exploration for natural gas and oil
4006429 beverly perdue is 100 percent opposed and says it wont happen on her watch i agree itll happen on my watch with your support
4006430 well see what happens when the scientists and engineers come up with what they determine
4006431 circumstances have changed and technology has now changed where we think this will be environmentally sound and very safe and i think studies have shown that across the nation and across the world
4006432 the people want out of this war and they want some changes in the economy
4006433 its going to be very difficult for the people of north carolina to vote for the status quo rather than change which is where we are right now
4006434 and im sure whatever the position is he can probably find somebody better than me
4006435 im interested in helping barack obama win so that the people of america win and thats all im interested in
4006436 ive been in public service 30 years im sort of like the rat ive had enough cheese i just want to get out of the trap i think its important to focus on whats in it for america not whats in it for me
4006437 a stretch for democrats but obamas team hopes a huge turnout from black voters will make this a battleground even the presence of john edwards as the democratic vice presidential nominee didnt help in 2004 as john kerry lost the state by 12 points
4006438 the suspect immediately jumped from the taxi wielding a straight razor in his hand officers j bloodworth j c banks and j r moore who were in the parking lot closest to the suspect began to challenge the suspect to drop his weapon the suspect refused to follow the commands of the officers and began yelling that he was not going to jail and that the officers were going to have to kill him
4006439 from his vantage point officer bloodworth thought that officer moore had been injured
4006440 chevron 18 7 billion bp 20 8 billion exxonmobil 40 6 billion big oil companies are making billions at our expense and where has elizabeth dole been in washington taking over a quarter million in campaign cash from big oil and voting to give them billions more in tax breaks tell elizabeth dole we need lower fuel costs not billions for big oil
4006441 big oils big windfall a minimum of 7 billion and as much as 28 billion
4006442 we assert that senator dole voted for billions in tax cuts for the oil industry because it is true
4006443 if you constitute an ordinance and it says youve got to have this and youve got to do that then not everybodys going to be able to have chickens some of my colleagues have said how are you going to police that my answer is the same way you police everything else you get a complaint you go out but you dont have to have somebody in a car going around looking for chickens
4006444 as we see the world today alliance is one of the few places where we would take a speculative stance in this market
4006445 were really focusing our attention on places where we feel like theres a special story right now and this is one of those
4006446 the economy has shifted to a knowledge based economy and universities are knowledge based resources
4006447 the university continues to attract partners which is a testament to the success of centennial campus
4006448 lesbian gay bisexual and transgender youth an epidemic of homelessness
4006449 the u s dept of health and human services estimates that the number of homeless and runaway youth ranges from 57 000 to 1 6 million per year our analysis of the available research suggests that between 20 percent and 40 percent of all homeless youth identify as lesbian gay bisexual or transgender lgbt given that between 3 percent and 5 percent of the u s population identifies as lesbian gay or bisexual it is clear that lgbt youth experience homelessness at a disproportionate rate

4006451 you never know what is going to happen when a game gets underway but clearly we didnt play well
4006452 the performance was poor but the result was good we didnt concede away from home which is always important and to play the second leg at anfield could make a massive difference
4006453 the positive thing was the result and we didnt have to say too much about the display in the dressing room because everybody already knew it wasnt good
4006454 they were very aggressive and we could not keep the ball
4006455 our passes were bad and we always lost the first and second ball
4006456 in the first 20 minutes they were on top of us and after that we controlled it a bit more
4006457 in the second half they started the same way and played more long balls and continued to win the first and second balls and if you dont win them you will continue to be under pressure
4006458 i was a little bit surprised because we were playing well in pre season with a lot of confidence
4006459 i told the players before after watching their super cup game against anderlecht that it could be like this
4006460 we knew they could be very aggressive they were organised and pressed well and it was difficult for us to keep the ball
4006461 i think the entire team didnt play well so the strikers midfielders and defenders didnt play well and pepe reina was man of the match
4006462 i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match
4006463 nuestra relaci n con la otan no puede seguir siendo la misma despu s de que el sr jaap de hoop scheffer secretario general de la alianza evit mencionar a las v ctimas del ataque georgiano contra osetia del sur y no dijo una sola palabra de condena a la agresi n

4006467 its been a long time since they were together and its not like that anymore
4006468 the democratic party platform of 2008 finally dropped its old abortion language
4006469 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
4006470 small groups can cause horror to the us and jews alike
4006471 we want to ensure that all champions trophy matches attract sizeable crowds and will take all possible measures for it
4006472 we will consult the icc and try lowering the ticket prices

4006476 ich bin nat rlich traurig platz sieben und die top ten sind erstmal stark und trotzdem schade die verletzung ist kein grund warum es nicht klappt

4006480 leadership is the main word that comes to mind when i think about john
4006481 he was really a leader and a big example for all of us on how to play the game and i think he could help a lot of the young guys here in the secondary there was a lot of talk about how he was older and whether he could get the job done but all i saw was someone who could get it done every day
4006482 it will be nice to be out there and play a little bit and see if we can make improvements from last week
4006483 its not about getting lined up in the formation and running the play now its about getting into a better play if the play we called in the huddle isnt the one we like the best when we line up on the field
4006484 those guys can adjust because they know the signals and routes they know how we want to run they know the techniques of the defensive backs i feel like from day 1 we were way ahead of last year i hope that shows up when we start playing the regular season
4006485 i think any young player always has to get on the same page he works hard and he comes out every day with things he wants to work on
4006486 some days it clicks and some days it doesnt click and you go back and try something new we have all been through that
4006487 vince has been our go to guy on that for a few years
4006488 coach bill belichick threw us a bone and it doesnt happen too often
4006489 especially this time of camp to go home and rest your body and get a chance to be with your families and relax you can call me up there a thousand times to make the catch
4006490 maybe the guys who made the mistake get some advice from guys who are running that dont feel like running
4006491 any time you add a guy like brett favre to a team it definitely never hurts
4006492 he didnt play quarterback for his first 6 1 2 years when you hear stories like that i think it inspires a lot of people
4006493 if i have to body slam you then whatever im going to go get it
4006494 the most important thing is to rush the passer not to try and stand in there and play volleyball at the net
4006495 nevertheless when the quarterback is throwing the ball you try to be in the passing lane and either hit the ball or sometimes just as importantly make him pull it down and reload it
4006496 if hes looking to the side theres not much point to get into the throwing lane because the throwing lane is not where you are
4006497 youve always got to be ready if you cant get to the quarterback to get your hands up
4006498 i just put my hands up i didnt have to do too much
4006499 this is the nfl we dont work on too much little stuff like that
4006500 but in junior high you work on things like that
4006501 year in and year out over the course of his career i think hes gotten his hands on more balls than anyone else around here and more balls than anyone else that ive coached probably as many as any player
4006502 hes probably about as good as youre going to get at that
4006503 some of that ball awareness and timing showed up in the ravens game
4006504 if youre not bumping up youll probably get your helmet knocked off

4006507 they desire average solutions by means and extremes and sometimes go off on a tangent in a search of absolute value

4006520 if the turkmens try to take this city from us i will take my weapons and i will fight for my people i can never let my people lose what theyve won
4006521 if we touch it and try to solve the problem it will blow up and if we continue ignoring and delaying it it will also eventually blow up
4006522 suddenly there were 50 people hitting me kicking me shouting kill him kill him
4006523 in the past it was just the politicians talking about fighting and civil war but now the people are starting to follow
4006524 this is the real danger and this is exactly what happened in baghdad in 2006
4006525 with their tongues they say everything is all right but in their hearts they want to kill each other
4006526 they sit with you and talk as if theyre angels they say i have no enemies and dont hate other religions and nationalities but the minute they are alone with their own sect they are the first ones to insult and hate
4006527 we will cut off jabbouris head if he thinks he can beat the kurds he doesnt understand kurdish history
4006528 your father always says bad things about the kurds he calls us thieves and hooligans and i stay quiet out of respect
4006529 the kurds think they should get special treatment because they suffered under saddam hussein but saddam did the same thing to the turkmens as he did to the kurds
4006530 are doing everything they can now to secure their long term advantage
4006531 the best solution on kirkuk is to just keep delaying it
4006532 we dont talk about politics in the house so things remain calm
4006533 das aufkommende f nf parteien system zwingt die spd zur linkspartei prinzipieller stellung zu nehmen
4006534 wenn sie es falsch macht wird es dazu f hren dass die linkspartei st rker wird als die spd

4006542 we the team sprinters know well do the fastest time weve ever done and thats all we can do
4006543 in for a shock because we are going better than we were in manchester
4006544 i have beaten hoy before and ill beat him again
4006545 we are able to equal the brits here in beijing i hope they wont perform as well as at the world championships they were at home there
4006546 we know were in the best shape we could be and the rest is out of our hands im confident that im in as good shape as i can be id be disappointed if i dont go better than ive ever gone before
4006547 but jason has stepped up to a whole new level its tough on ross but nobody could have foreseen how well jason would go him coming into the squad means were significantly faster than we were in manchester
4006548 she thought she deserved parity and shes got a point

4006553 but i think if he comes back to england then he comes back to arsenal
4006554 i know that racing santander blackburn and arsenal are interested
4006555 i have not heard anything about the united interest myself i let my agent manage this
4006556 united was my favourite club as a child if i get the chance it would be a dream for me
4006557 i cross my fingers that something will happen in the next days

4006579 no other country has experienced such rapid racial and ethnic change
4006580 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4006581 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4006582 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4006583 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4006584 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4006585 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4006586 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4006587 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4006588 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4006589 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4006590 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4006591 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4006592 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4006593 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4006603 a couple of months ago we werent sure that if kerri got into a jam shed be able to bang her way out of it
4006604 but today she really swung away and hit a couple of balls really hard
4006605 its such a big weapon for her she likes to just bang her way out of a pickle and she did that today
4006606 the shoulder takes a little time to wake up sometimes
4006607 but it seems like the more it hurts the better i play
4006608 now we she and charpantidis are getting picky working on this little thing here or there but i have the feeling now that if i feel something in the shoulder im just able to push my way through it
4006609 i was so bummed out in april may june misty and troy kept saying look its not about june and july its about august
4006610 now that im here im where i want to be thank goodness
4006611 its tough but we just got our own american record by four seconds so we cant complain about it
4006612 the huge mistake i made four years ago by taking the preliminaries too lightly has been eating at me for a long time and for me to go out there and accomplish that medal im really excited obviously it doesnt top the 400 freestyle relay from the other night but its something that has really pushed me for four years
4006613 im feeling a little tired right now and i got a couple days of rest
4006614 hes got a great stroke hes got great power in his stroke to be able to do a 50 all the way to a 200 and he has some of the best endurance in the world
4006615 it felt really good it felt a lot like yesterday morning i just wasnt as fast on the third 50 i could tell thats where they moved up
4006616 its such an honor to be surrounded by such incredible people all the time and to be able to compete for my country is really one of the best feelings in the world

4006622 the decision to acquire the sculpture reclining woman 2004 by fernando botero for the costa luminosa is first and foremost the consequence of a personal passion for that artists creative work as a whole and also represents the continuation of a tradition for costa namely that of decorating our ships with contemporary works embracing the various forms of expressive art and displaying them to our guests on vacation
4006623 this particular sculpture by botero has such expressive force and energy that it will interact with and influence the setting and interior design in the spectacular atrium of the ship where it is to be permanently exhibited
4006624 huh doesnt seem like something that should be on a ship

4006628 the former activists are also disillusioned with the constant reports of fraud and corruption rising rate of poverty among the poor rising violent crime situation
4006629 theres a strong demand that the nic should be revived to represent the progressive voices within the indian community
4006630 we believe the nic can once again play this role
4006631 i believe a lot of people will welcome the revival of the nic because of its rich history in fighting for freedom in this country
4006632 the anc must admit that it has failed in drawing the support of the indian people and therefore theres a need for an organisation such as the nic to work within the indian
4006633 im pretty certain that most progressive people will welcome the move
4006634 our expectation is that any action will be consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution

4006636 the retailer will make its largest investment yet in the country since it started operating in brazil fourteen years ago

4006639 pico d is an exceptionally smart looking product but after you carry it in your pocket and use it for a while you realize that theres much more to it than handsome looks very few other usb drives can measure up to the pico d in features performance and quality
4006640 our engineers and manufacturing people fussed over minute details for months before we took pico d to production so the finished drive has an unmatched feel of quality to it

4006643 of course i want the england captaincy maybe i do deserve another chance
4006644 ive been awfully lucky to get the armband in the past and thats something that will never leave me
4006645 the performance was poor although the result was good but there has to be a massive difference in the second leg
4006646 the players know it was a bad performance and sometimes you dont need to say too much in the dressing room they were very aggressive our passes and our second balls were bad and in the first 15 or 20 minutes they were completely on top
4006647 one nil to the arsenal was heard when william gallas scored and then
4006648 i dont think people in england would be surprised at the way i set up the team mcclaren said
4006649 were disappointed but im proud of the performance mcclaren said
4006650 you saw a performance of great spirit i knew arsenal were rattled after 10 minutes i sensed wenger was getting rattled arsenal knew theyd been in a game we opened arsenal up we just didnt have the finish the difference was they had adebayor and van persie up front
4006651 mcclaren did very well they man marked everyone arsenals manager observed
4006652 they were very physical man marking all over the pitch in the second half we took over because twente had given so much in the first half they couldnt keep their pace up they gave us a tough game credit to them they were great
4006653 we had a very young team but denilson and ramsey 20 and 17 did very well centrally in a game of that level wenger said
4006654 very big underdog in this tie yet twente almost seized the lead after 24 minutes
4006655 we have a helluva mountain to climb in the second leg mcclaren admitted his stock is certainly climbing
4006656 when abhinav fired the first shot in the sighting time practice time it hit the target between the fourth and fifth rings
4006657 it is unthinkable of any shooter competing at this level to score 4 5 points but he remained calm and corrected the angle of his sight and the end result is in front of you
4006658 actually you cannot blame anyone for its your duty to take care of your gun he was the only indian to qualify so there were shooters only from other countries in that room
4006659 you saw a performance of great spirit and arsenal were rattled they know they have been in a game
4006660 we are so disappointed but proud of the performance it just showed our inexperience in europe in key moments and key occasions that we lost this game
4006661 we have a hell of a mountain to climb now but we just need to put in another good performance certainly this team will learn a lot and be better for it
4006662 we had a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic
4006663 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit
4006664 they have given so much in the first half they could not keep the same pace and tightness in their marking
4006665 it seems like it is all coming together for kelly she has great talent the key for her is going to be staying healthy
4006666 ive had a really unlucky year my worst year ever for injuries but i know i can perform and i know i can mix it with the best
4006667 i see myself as a realistic gold medal chance and even though at times its slipped away because of injuries i know its still there
4006668 im not fazed by the competition at the olympics and what it stands for if you win
4006669 and im not fazed that there are four girls who have scored higher than me this season
4006670 im pretty confident that my success at previous championships hold me in good stead
4006671 it would definitely be sweeter to beat her in beijing because i believe she shouldnt be at the olympics games
4006672 the olympic champion should be clean and he should be able to prove that
4006673 i want to get through all the rounds and when i get to the final just think of it as just another race and forget about whats going to happen after by just focusing on winning and executing properly
4006674 id say that the only chance anyone has of beating me is probably getting out in front of me at the start of the race
4006675 ive spoken to past olympic medallists and all but one of them have gone for bolt to win this
4006676 im a fan of gays and the way hes leading the new generation of american sprinters but no champion in recent years has won the title without a background of european competition
4006677 if bolt gets a good start forget it itll be story over if bolt gets the worst start and powell gets the best its still going to be close
4006678 usain will never win any style points but hes the best finisher and he has more ways of winning than the other two

4006688 you never know what is going to happen when a game gets underway but clearly we didnt play well
4006689 the performance was poor but the result was good we didnt concede away from home which is always important and to play the second leg at anfield could make a massive difference
4006690 the positive thing was the result and we didnt have to say too much about the display in the dressing room because everybody already knew it wasnt good
4006691 they were very aggressive and we could not keep the ball
4006692 our passes were bad and we always lost the first and second ball
4006693 in the first 20 minutes they were on top of us and after that we controlled it a bit more
4006694 in the second half they started the same way and played more long balls and continued to win the first and second balls and if you dont win them you will continue to be under pressure
4006695 i was a little bit surprised because we were playing well in pre season with a lot of confidence
4006696 i told the players before after watching their super cup game against anderlecht that it could be like this
4006697 we knew they could be very aggressive they were organised and pressed well and it was difficult for us to keep the ball
4006698 i think the entire team didnt play well so the strikers midfielders and defenders didnt play well and pepe reina was man of the match
4006699 i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match
4006700 este visul oric rui t n r s ajung s prezinte o emisiune la mtv iar pentru mine acest top a fost ansa perfect de a mi ndeplini acest vis i de a m prezenta publicului rom n exact a a cum sunt
4006701 the serial will depict the human side of the father of the nation it is for the first time that such a tv series is being planned on the indian television
4006702 besides being the father of the nation as we know him today mahatma gandhi was also a family man a husband and a father the proposed serial will depict him more as a human being than as a political personality
4006703 my film has grossed rs 460 480 million over the first weekend thats more than om shanti om and welcome which had the highest opening so far so obviously the film has been liked i cant please every single sikh
4006704 who are these agitators this is nothing but a shortcut to fame the boys of the sikh youth federation mustve thought that when delhis gurdwara committee protested akshay rushed to delhi in amritsar they mustve thought this is their way of getting akshay into amritsar
4006705 all the important and powerful bodies of the sikh community cleared the film what were these boys on friday protesting about they said they hadnt even seen the film they just said it was an insult to sikhism but in what way
4006706 they feel somehow their culture will be threatened when films like jodhaa akbar and singh is kinng pay homage to the people and culture of a community
4006707 they were doing bhangra with dhols after the screening they told a news channel that this was the first film in 70 years of indian cinema that had done justice to the sikh community what more endorsement for our motives can there be
4006708 the final authority on right and wrong in a film should be the censor board once the board approves all protests should be crushed with iron hands otherwise all of us should just fold up our production houses im not disrespecting sikh sentiments so please stop hounding me for nothing
4006709 we admit akshays beard shouldve been longer we added a scene where akshay says he made a mistake by trimming his beard and in the video with snoop dogg during the end titles he comes with a full beard albeit a false one
4006710 itd have taken akshay two years to grow a natural beard we had told the shiromani gurdwara prabandhak committee sgpc that the beard would be false and they had agreed
4006711 the opening of singh is kinng has been incredible business everywhere has been thundering but i can only rest easy after the first two weeks im glad that in spite of being a comedy singh is kinng isnt vulgar
4006712 i gave my director anees bazmi the freedom to do what he likes i only wanted him to tell a morally correct story i didnt want to flinch while watching it with my sons
4006713 akshay had a fierce cold while dubbing there was no way we could postpone so we used his nasal voice and akshay even added a line in the dialogue about his character having a terrible cold
4006714 people have been calling me the seniormost actor in the film i almost feel like amitabh bachchan now the others in the film are extremely good actors and not at all inexperienced
4006715 they have a lot of experience and have absolute clarity in their mind on what they want to do they are very spontaneous and we even get together very well in that way
4006716 the character in the film is just like me radhika works and keeps her relationship going simultaneously the role is very contemporary she is an effortless dresser she wears shorts and vests and uses all kinds of funky bags and accessories
4006717 i was completely pampered on the sets and have finally made two great friends in ranbir and siddharth i have not spent enough time with the girls though

4006719 when you go to your mums funeral you dont expect all the players to go there
4006720 you might expect a representative from the club but i had all the lads there it shows you what real men are and what real friendships are
4006721 the amount of letters of support ive had from chelsea fans has been overwhelming and in fact from fans everywhere when you sit down and weigh everything up you realise that people feel that strongly for you and show you so much at a difficult time of your life maybe you do feel you should try and repay them
4006722 i sat and watched that game with my family it was a very emotional moment
4006723 ill never forget it ive always said that this club would always be the biggest thing in my football history as an old man ill be back here sitting and watching
4006724 the last few months have been a difficult period of my life with what happened in my personal life i asked chelsea for some time to get my head straight im close to my family and they will always come first to me
4006725 this contract will take me to 34 and if you look around there are a lot of top professionals playing like ryan giggs still offering a lot to their club at that age
4006726 ive never been a player relying on pace i think ive got another level i think we all believe that we have another level in the last two years weve had untold issues within the club and last year we nearly went and won three trophies so this year were all very confident we can win more
4006727 he mourinho works as hard as anyone ive ever known as a manager

4006800 2 146 employees applying for work through recruitment agencies across australia to gain an understanding of the experiences and beliefs about bullying and discrimination among australian employees today
4006801 almost one in three 30 employees claiming they have been bullied at work one in four 24 claiming they have been discriminated against and 44 per cent stating they have witnessed their colleagues experience either of these
4006802 27 per cent of respondents say they feel bullying or discrimination has happened to them within the past two years
4006803 when asked about their peers almost half 46 of respondents say they have seen their colleagues bullied or discriminated against within the past two years 31 per cent of this group say multiple times
4006804 its quite shocking to hear from employees that this sort of behaviour continues to happen in modern times but organisations need to realise that bullying and unfair treatment of staff is occurring and could be impacting their own workplace culture or worse still exposing them to the risk of liability possible fines and even brand damage

4006809 we are finding out what the children want and we are looking to see if we can give it to them but that doesnt mean we are rewarding bad behaviour if youngsters are messing around and being antisocial we will deal with that as well
4006810 i think youll find that this is the real deal

4006823 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4006824 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4006825 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
4006826 the great atmosphere here in china allowed everyone to be filled with enthusiasm and good morale
4006827 the crowd was unbelievable they were cheering very loud it was great fun

4006829 the last 50 metres was hard work it hurt quite a bit and the chinese girls swam an awesome race
4006830 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i tried to relax
4006831 in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about the others
4006832 we swam together and i felt like we were in training
4006833 the best moment is when i turned back and i saw the number one next to my name
4006834 its huge unbelievable at any moment i felt that i could be beaten

4006954 in actual fact they are 29 year old affluent men with plenty of disposable income
4006955 brands and products that hold clear contextual relevance to the gaming experience such as automotive for racing games sports brands for football games would benefit from in game advertising high interest categories such as mobile and fashion will also do well

4007193 so were now talking to our staff about collective agreements to make sure that they have the best terms and conditions he said
4007194 there will be a number of options and you will be hearing more from telstra on that
4007195 das ist nicht 1968 und die invasion in der tschechoslowakei wo russland einen nachbarn bedrohen die hauptstadt besetzen eine regierung st rzen und damit durchkommen kann

4007202 im spielverlauf war es nicht gut f rs selbstvertrauen im nachhinein ja
4007203 wir waren abgekl rter und diszipliniert und haben ein vern nftiges spiel abgeliefert ich hoffe dass wir auf dem weg weitermachen
4007204 jetzt sind wir drin im turnier wir wissen dass wir fast im viertelfinale sind dann geht das turnier erst richtig los
4007205 unsere chancenverwertung war ausreichend um in schulnoten zu sprechen wir m ssen aber mindestens auf befriedigend kommen

4007220 i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of being foreign and exotic place he should be in myrtle beach
4007221 it was clumsily said and it comes at a horrible time
4007222 there is a occasional lack of confidence that we have we have about this place that makes us feel more defensive
4007223 the broader issue has to do with the difficulty that barrack obama has in defining himself where he is from and what he is like
4007224 yes i think there is an attempt to make obama look like he hadnt had that classic kansas upbringing

4007229 theres not much enemy left in iraq but theres plenty of enemy here to be dealt with
4007230 theres a discussion underway only if the decision is made to replace them what we will insist on is that it be a full up capacity
4007231 we dont want another force in there that isnt fully adaptive for what we think were going to face
4007232 say this draw down in iraq works and marines are made free then weve got to train marines for afghanistan as opposed to going to iraq that takes time that takes four or five months
4007233 it is a mission where anything less than perfection is not acceptable and that is the standard
4007234 that certainly is the standard of the folks that brought that to us through the years and we will return to that standard
4007235 what i can promise you is that were taking a comprehensive look at this issue so this is not onesies and twosies and a handful of fixes
4007236 the americans are not ready to allow us to attack iran
4007237 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
4007238 the only thing to do is to continue to act in the field of intelligence and to strengthen economic sanctions against the government of president mahmoud ahmadinejad
4007239 the points didnt go for me today in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out the scoring here is so bad for an olympic games its unbelievable
4007240 we were a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic
4007241 in the end maybe our technical superiority allowed us to score two goals that is a massive advantage for the second leg but we will be on our toes
4007242 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit
4007243 they have given so much in the first half they could not keep the same pace and tightness in their marking
4007244 you saw a performance of great spirit and arsenal were rattled they know they have been in a game
4007245 it just showed our inexperience in europe in key moments and key occasions that we lost this game
4007246 we have a hell of a mountain to climb now but we just need to put in another good performance
4007247 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favourites again to win the premier league but regarding arsenal they also have a great team but im not sure if the group have enough experience and quality to win
4007248 i see nobody else to win the premier league but tottenham surely have the quality to fight for a top four finish
4007249 i cannot really say who the surprise team will be but year after year we always wait for a better newcastle
4007250 they are a top club they have huge support and they have good players so we wait for more from them
4007251 phil scolari has not made a lot of changes since he arrived at the club
4007252 he has kept the same structure the same system and the same football he is a good leader and he can do very well
4007253 the only insight or advice i would give him ahead of his first season is that he is in a club that is ready to win
4007254 we have a good draw and i think a good chance to go through but we must approach it professionally
4007255 you can lose to anybody they are professionals as well and will want to win the first leg at least
4007256 on a bad day if we are not concentrating then we can lose this kind of game so we must be careful and take it seriously we took odense seriously in the intertoto cup and that is how we should always be
4007257 i dont really like to talk about attitude because we are all professionals and get a lot of money to play football so we should go into each game with the right attitude there is no excuse for not having it
4007258 and if we can progress as far as possible in europe this season that will help the development of the team and the individual players
4007259 if he gets on the bus he has every chance of being picked
4007260 we were very lucky to have got away with a draw very lucky not to have conceded goals
4007261 it was a very disappointing performance but the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4007262 it will be different at anfield there we are expected to win and we will have our own fans behind us liege had their very noisy fans for the first leg
4007263 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
4007264 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
4007265 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
4007266 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
4007267 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match
4007268 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
4007269 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
4007270 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
4007271 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
4007272 we felt that if we did not lose this leg we would still be in with a chance we know though that we still have to score and that could be the problem
4007273 both those contracts and discussions have been put on the shelf
4007274 the season is starting and those will be re visited next year
4007275 this contract will take me to 34 and if you look around there are a lot of top professionals playing like ryan giggs players like that offering a lot to their club both on the pitch and off it
4007276 and i certainly feel that i can do that in a big way
4007277 yes the manchester united game and what they did there i sat and watched that game with my family and what they did there it was a very emotional moment
4007278 i will never forget it i cant speak highly enough of the lads and what they did john terry as a captain creates that kind of spirit among the lads and the others follow because they are all great lads
4007279 when you go to your mums funeral you dont expect all the players to go there you might expect a representative from the club i had all the lads there and thats something that goes beyond football and shows you what real men are and what real friendships are
4007280 i made my decision for frank lampard simple as that i want to do what is best for me my family and my football
4007281 all i can say is that he is one of the best managers in the world hes shown that when he was here and i have no doubts he will be successful in the future wherever he goes
4007282 hes a winner that is his future and this is my future
4007283 i have no problems with my situation i have come here to make sure a fantastic club is successful in the future
4007284 being in the spotlight is not something i am unaware of or have never experienced
4007285 the spotlight in my playing career was always there and as a national manager you had the nations hopes pinned on you
4007286 and when you are in the premier league like i have been the spotlight is on you all the time
4007287 i am a football person and just want the games to start i have come here with ambition and am aiming to take the club forward that is the message i want to get through
4007288 they are good opposition who are playing well at the moment
4007289 it will be a big test for us and not a walkover as some people might be in danger of thinking
4007290 they are a big strong physical side who have eight guys over six feet and we have to match that
4007291 we want to progress and feel if get into the latter stages we have the quality in the squad to go right to the end thats the aim
4007292 it is likely darius will not be available for something like 10 weeks
4007293 he will be in a brace for six weeks and then will need another month to build up his fitness
4007294 and in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4007295 and once the dust settles we can then look at assisting the georgians in rebuilding their military
4007296 they are a sovereign nation an ally which needs a means to defend itself and we will at an appropriate time work with them on reconstructing their forces
4007297 we do not want there to be any potential misunderstanding or miscalculation
4007298 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
4007299 it is simply not a requirement of this mission and it is not something we are seeking to do
4007300 we are going to look at a wide range of assistance options that are available to us
4007301 the quickest way to expedite and provide some immediate relief from suffering is to do it by air
4007302 youve got to send the assessment team in to figure out what the needs are and once you figure out what the needs are you figure out how to meet those needs
4007303 the security responsibility of the capital kabul will be handed to the national army and afghan security forces on august 28
4007304 this move is the beginning of afghan security forces taking responsibilities of security from nato which with the further growth of the forces will expand all over afghanistan
4007305 there are a number of nato troops currently responsible for kabul security
4007306 they are patrolling the city once the handover takes place well take those responsibilities
4007307 but those involved in training afghan security forces with logistics or with administrative issues they will remain in kabul
4007308 when the full transfer of leadership will take place it will not be immediately obvious
4007309 what will happen will be vital the afghans taking full charge of kabul but on the streets it will not look so different
4007310 the swiss are a very knowledgable and demanding customer and this very extensive flight and ground evaluation will really put us to the test consequently i am convinced that this is an excellent opportunity for us to demonstrate to the swiss authorities the real and proven qualities of the gripen fighter
4007311 tomorrow were going to negotiate all day i cant predict the result but its clear that were closer to the demands of prime minister donald tusk than we were a month ago
4007312 we are perhaps going to reap the reward of our efforts
4007313 the american side has considerably softened its stance over recent days
4007314 they are much readier to accept polands two cardinal conditions
4007315 today were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4007316 the rising international tension which has caught us by surprise makes security guarantees even more important than ever
4007317 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4007318 as soon as we are sure that polands security has been reinforced to the degree we want were not going to wait for hours to sign a deal
4007319 this important issue for poland will perhaps reach a happy end
4007320 this situation escalated the way it did because of miscalculations especially on the part of saakashvili
4007321 i dont know if they thought the international community and russia would be occupied with the olympics or what but there was utter miscalculation
4007322 i believe therell be some damage as people question whether or not he needed to do the things he did
4007323 there are some people who are saying that now we should move faster on membership
4007324 but those who are sceptical will see this as another argument against nato membership
4007325 whether mistakes were made whether they underestimated the power of the russians
4007326 the russians are destroying the infrastructure in parts of the country and that will cost millions to repair plus theres a world economic crisis that will affect our eventual recovery
4007327 on top of that russia will probably impose more economic sanctions to further hurt the georgian economy
4007328 the expertise and dedication of our missile defense agency customer and every member of the industry team have made this important mission success milestone possible
4007329 into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
4007330 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire for the pledge that it undertook
4007331 that will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
4007332 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4007333 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
4007334 may demand that naval ships and aircraft of the black sea fleet leave
4007335 the innovation is aimed at creating serious difficulties for the practical activities of the fleet directly contradicting
4007336 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by

4007350 commenting on the new study richard wood of the hadley centre said the model suggested the weakening of the moc would have a cooling effect around the north atlantic
4007351 such a cooling could temporarily offset the longer term warming trend from increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
4007352 its just politics the problem just that people are allowing their political views to interfere with climate science proper
4007353 look if we really took this seriously we would have no reason to suppose that important issues like agw could ever be rationally resolved even among reasonable people but that would leave us with no motive to participate in the debate what would be the point of arguing
4007354 that the causal chain run through a stable a durable structure rather that depending on intervening coincidental events

4007363 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
4007364 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
4007365 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
4007366 the us food and drug administration and other health organisations around the world have concluded that msg is safe

4007377 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
4007378 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4007379 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
4007380 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
4007381 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
4007382 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4007383 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4007384 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4007385 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4007386 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
4007387 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
4007388 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
4007389 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
4007390 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
4007391 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
4007392 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
4007393 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
4007394 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
4007395 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
4007396 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
4007397 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4007398 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
4007399 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
4007400 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
4007401 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
4007402 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4007403 the right information has to be given to the people
4007404 yang peiyi missed out on selection to appear at the ceremony because of her external appearance it was for the national interest
4007405 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
4007406 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great
4007407 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4007408 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4007409 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
4007410 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
4007411 chens original interview was posted on beijing radios web site sunday night by tuesday the link was shut down the chinese government routinely blocks sites that are politically sensitive or that could cause embarrassment to the countrys communist rulers
4007412 according to reports lin miaoke the cute seven year old who sang the national anthem was actually miming

4007422 if prime minister souar is to break with the past he needs to insist that security forces responsible for murder rape and torture are brought to justice
4007423 for too long successive leaders in guinea have stood back and done nothing in the face of ongoing and well known human rights abuses
4007424 the message being sent to security forces is that violence and indiscipline are acceptable and thats a very dangerous thing

4007438 yes thats great and thank you but what does the text say
4007439 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
4007440 true revival will be accompanied by brokenness humility reverence and repentance not the arrogance showmanship and empty hype that often was on display in lakeland
4007441 a prominent pentecostal evangelist called me this week after bentleys news hit the fan
4007442 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
4007443 i really dont think this is an appropriate question britney does not have to answer that
4007444 ok so can you work out how many people youd need to call to get danny devito on the line

4007458 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
4007459 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
4007460 but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
4007461 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him
4007462 whoever will call on the name of the lord will be saved
4007463 while we had expected that the bigots and white supremacists would focus their anger on barack obama as the african american candidate what has happened is that both candidates are equally unacceptable to white supremacists who see them as being controlled and manipulated by the jews
4007464 in the warped conspiratorial worldview of the haters mccain and obama are equally tainted by the controlling hand of jews who they allege control the government and pull the levers of power in washington
4007465 the new words we added to this 11th edition of the chambers dictionary paint a vivid picture of current interests and concerns

4007476 we hope motorway service station operators will consider what more they could do to ease the pain at the pumps
4007477 meanwhile as we hit the peak summer holiday driving season and with fuel prices at current levels every penny counts by spending a couple of extra minutes to come off motorways drivers really can be quids in by taking advantage of significant fuel savings

4007481 what happened was that during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked as to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4007482 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture however some european media did not see it as such
4007483 some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
4007484 if anyone feels offended by it we totally apologize for it
4007485 we understand that the spanish team intended no offense and has apologized
4007486 the matter rests there as far as the i o c is concerned

4007497 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4007498 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4007499 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4007500 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4007501 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4007502 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4007503 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4007504 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4007505 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4007506 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4007507 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4007508 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4007509 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4007510 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4007511 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4007514 if anyone feels offended by it we totally apologize for it
4007515 to me it was little clownish for our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because they are the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
4007516 the night before the race my coach said to me that we will have two chinese swimmers in the final so you dont need to force yourself to win gold you just need to try your best

4007520 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4007521 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4007522 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4007523 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4007524 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4007525 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4007526 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4007527 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4007528 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4007529 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente

4007537 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4007538 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4007539 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4007540 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4007541 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4007542 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4007543 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4007544 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4007545 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4007546 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4007547 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4007548 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4007549 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4007551 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4007552 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4007554 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4007558 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4007559 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4007560 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4007561 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4007609 the problem with mr mahmoud ahmadinejad is that not only he himself do not understand anything about modern economy but because of his firm belief that mahdi the muslim shias twelfth imam would soon reappear and arrange everything to the liking of the iranians he has no confidence in economic experts and listen to no one except yes men
4007610 at the same time with a yes and no policy the ruling ayatollahs also hope that the six or at least four of them meaning minus russia and china would get serious in implementing the sanctions thus providing iranian officials the tools to portray the islamic republic as a victim of the imperialists and justify more sacrifices from the iranian people including accepting more repressions more censorship of the press and expressions more restrictions on the already badly limited social and cultural freedoms

4007612 irans government has ordered the state oil company to deposit oil revenues only in selected banks in a bid to dodge toughening sanctions over its nuclear drive local media reported on saturday
4007613 this stance would not change through any sanction or threat
4007614 such suspicious comments do not at all help build trust among states of the region they can only stoke conflicts and drag the region into a cycle of dangerous crises
4007615 urged iran on saturday to resolve tensions with the west over its nuclear program saying the dispute undermined the interests of gulf states with which it shares a vital oil export route
4007616 syria of president bashar assad which contrary to his iranian counterpart does not seek the annihilation of israel would certainly leave the camp of the regions radicals led by iran and join the west if and when it can trust washington and tel aviv the day damascus recovers the golan heights it would establish full relations with israel
4007617 bashar is preparing himself for this historic moment a move that would certainly change the face of the middle east this is what very probably assad informed the iranians during his last visit to tehran last week and very probably he also told iranians that it is time for them to change to the regions new realities

4007651 it has been a good year and tonight is the culmination of a long period of preparations it was possible by the hard wok and desire to win by the boys and no doubt the support by the aiff the boys deserve to win
4007652 it was a good team effort there were also some good individual efforts it was one of those performances in which a determined group of players almost finished the game in the first 25 minutes against a strong opponent
4007653 i said there were good individual performances and chhetri was one of them he is a remarkable player and future star for india he scored indias lone goal against myanmar in the semi final and another three today in the last 100 minutes he has scored four goals that is fantastic

4007657 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4007658 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4007659 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4007660 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4007661 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4007662 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4007663 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4007664 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4007665 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4007666 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4007667 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4007668 monkeys at work please do not tap on the glass
4007669 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4007670 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4007671 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4007672 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4007673 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4007674 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4007675 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4007676 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4007677 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4007678 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4007679 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4007680 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4007681 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4007682 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4007683 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4007684 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4007685 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4007686 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4007687 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4007688 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4007689 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4007690 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4007691 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4007692 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4007693 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4007694 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4007695 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4007696 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4007697 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4007698 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4007699 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4007700 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4007701 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4007702 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4007703 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4007704 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4007705 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4007706 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4007707 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4007708 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4007709 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4007710 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4007711 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4007712 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4007713 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4007714 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4007715 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4007716 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4007717 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4007718 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4007719 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

4007723 kita berikan kepada indosat silahkan dikaji kalau memenuhi persyaratan dilanjutkan kalau nggak selesai ya distop
4007724 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4007725 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and republicans know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4007726 it will be interesting to see what the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4007727 it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax
4007728 just because a bill comes to the floor with offshore and energy in the title doesnt mean its a good offshore drilling bill
4007729 speaker pelosi is only going to schedule a vote on an offshore energy bill if she believes it would be politically perilous not to and even then its not going to have much energy in it
4007730 and ill bet you when members come back from their districts youll find more movement taking place
4007731 its nonsensical that its safe to drill off the coast of texas and louisiana and mississippi and yes california but its not safe to drill anywhere else the average hardworking american doesnt understand that
4007732 always concerned about the push for more drilling off our coasts from the oil industry and its supporters
4007733 a huge erosion of support for the moratorium among democrats

4007785 al melvin is not a common sense republican but an extreme ideological candidate
4007786 is allowing special interest extremists in maricopa county to dictate his positions
4007787 hes trying very hard to portray himself as more conservative in the primary in hopes that people will believe it
4007788 mr melvin is bad for our party bad for our state and bad for district 26
4007789 last week one of these simple brilliant ideas got built
4007790 librarything appears poised to turn the cataloging of books into a form of communal recreation
4007791 forty percent of u s energy is used as electricity
4007792 the easiest way to get electricity is using a solid fuel such as coal
4007793 it is my hope that illinois will take the lead in renewable energy and that the state will benefit from that lead
4007794 miscanthus sacchariflorus and some of the other fertile miscanthus species can be quite invasive
4007795 people are dying because of the inadequacy of our current transplant system so why arent we reaching out to find the best solution why is this being done secretly in the smoke filled backrooms
4007796 imagine if they asked a bunch of transplant people to run the blood transfusion system that would be laughable
4007797 this is a joke but its not a joke for the canadians who are dying
4007798 this is clearly a major step forward toward providing comprehensive organ transplant services to canadians
4007799 there are questions and appropriately so about what this new system will be
4007800 we dont see blood and organs as similar products because theyre not but there is a service delivery model in place that can be taken advantage of to improve the organ donor system
4007801 this is in no way shape or form a power grab
4007802 a tough and hardworking newsman he was always well informed and thorough in his interviews and he was as gregarious off the set as he was prepared on it
4007803 you felt as though you had hit a home run off the best pitcher in the league i just loved tim and i will miss him more than i can say
4007804 regardless of party affiliation he demanded that you be straight with him and with the american people who were watching

4007806 it was a measure of the degree to which tim russert was respected in the journalistic world that he was the first broadcaster elected to membership in the gridiron club after the rules were changed in 2004 to end our century old restriction to print journalists

4007824 in all the provinces the exemplification of the genocide ideology are identical
4007825 we were looking for a physical fullback hes 6 foot 235 now in college football generally there is no fullback anymore we were looking for a guy with athleticism who would go out there and bang heads
4007826 he really showed up on film and special teams as a guy with speed who wasnt afraid to hit people the beauty of the practice squad is it gives you a chance to see people who otherwise would be out of the league
4007827 they thought i had the body type to translate to fullback
4007828 i talked it over with my agent things hadnt been going as well as id liked in washington i just saw it as a great opportunity a chance to start over
4007829 it took a long time to get comfortable at fullback especially with all the shifts and motions that offensive coordinator norv turner had
4007830 hitting somebody from the other side of the ball was a harder transition than i thought
4007831 he definitely has a chance to make the roster because hes one of our core guys on special teams
4007832 hes got instincts from playing both sides of the ball
4007833 hes a four way starter both punt teams and both kickoff teams moran is a different body type 6 1 250 hes more of a guard he can do the kickoff return team well and he can do field goals but hes a backup coverage type body hes not as versatile as zak is because zak has more speed and more athletic ability
4007834 he has a standard of work ethic and toughness that was unsurpassed
4007835 he was a sideline to sideline player at linebacker but we also played him at tight end fullback and tailback he knew how to use leverage he understood the game
4007836 a safety came up to hit him and landed 5 yards deep in the end zone zak just trucked him we knew then that he was a special player
4007837 he twice led the conference in tackles every team had to game plan for him
4007838 the discovery of a new dish confers more happiness on humanity than the discovery of a new star
4007839 the former speaker of the house visited the hedges clinic in frankfort and then silver cross in joliet he observed how electronic medical records can link several physicians caring for the same patient at different times and different points along the care spectrum
4007840 i think what youre doing in beginning to reach out to doctors and integrating the whole community is really really important
4007841 and i encourage you to continue doing it and develop it
4007842 in 2005 the ontario government decided to transfer the operation of georgetown hospital from william osler health centre to halton healthcare services
4007843 dozens of patients at a north london hospital went untreated for at least six months after the hospital introduced it systems under the nhss 12 7 billion national programme for it computer weekly has learned
4007844 massachusetts gov deval patrick d has signed legislation mandating hospitals and community health centers to implement interoperable electronic health records systems by oct 1 2015 as a condition of their state license
4007845 how are web 2 0 technologies like social networks wikis and online communities changing the face of the health care industry how are hospital systems and physician practices evolving as a result of rapid technological change how can health plans evolve in the face of emerging challenges with the help of new technologies and new thinking what will come of the recent controversies over genetic testing and the privacy of patient data where does the hype over social networks and user generated content end and the reality begin
4007846 it would be a very dangerous move to have a situation where the government saw its major role as guaranteeing lending why should the taxpayer take on the risk of borrowing by individual borrowers some of whom are risky its the lenders who should take the risk
4007847 i had been throwing up all morning and didnt have much energy
4007848 since early 2006 pakistani militant groups have increased their collaboration with al qaida this includes ethnic pashtun groups native to the tribal areas and groups from eastern pakistan most of whom previously focused on attacking kashmir in india
4007849 while a major focus of these groups is conducting attacks against coalition forces in afghanistan they provide safe haven to al qaida fighters collaborate on attacks inside pakistan and support external operations including against the west
4007850 theres no indication that any of the aliens were involved in any terrorist activity at all
4007851 i am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world
4007852 i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country
4007853 our adversaries are trying to destabilize pakistan from several fronts internal as well as external
4007854 the serial will depict the human side of the father of the nation it is for the first time that such a tv series is being planned on the indian television
4007855 besides being the father of the nation as we know him today mahatma gandhi was also a family man a husband and a father the proposed serial will depict him more as a human being than as a political personality
4007856 people have been calling me the seniormost actor in the film i almost feel like amitabh bachchan now the others in the film are extremely good actors and not at all inexperienced
4007857 they have a lot of experience and have absolute clarity in their mind on what they want to do they are very spontaneous and we even get together very well in that way
4007858 the character in the film is just like me radhika works and keeps her relationship going simultaneously the role is very contemporary she is an effortless dresser she wears shorts and vests and uses all kinds of funky bags and accessories
4007859 i was completely pampered on the sets and have finally made two great friends in ranbir and siddharth i have not spent enough time with the girls though
4007860 i got a lot of compliments in italy for the clothes i was wearing italian men only know how to romance they are impeccably dressed with styled hair and they only want to marry you
4007861 my film has grossed rs 460 480 million over the first weekend thats more than om shanti om and welcome which had the highest opening so far so obviously the film has been liked i cant please every single sikh
4007862 who are these agitators this is nothing but a shortcut to fame the boys of the sikh youth federation mustve thought that when delhis gurdwara committee protested akshay rushed to delhi in amritsar they mustve thought this is their way of getting akshay into amritsar
4007863 all the important and powerful bodies of the sikh community cleared the film what were these boys on friday protesting about they said they hadnt even seen the film they just said it was an insult to sikhism but in what way
4007864 they feel somehow their culture will be threatened when films like jodhaa akbar and singh is kinng pay homage to the people and culture of a community
4007865 they were doing bhangra with dhols after the screening they told a news channel that this was the first film in 70 years of indian cinema that had done justice to the sikh community what more endorsement for our motives can there be
4007866 the final authority on right and wrong in a film should be the censor board once the board approves all protests should be crushed with iron hands otherwise all of us should just fold up our production houses im not disrespecting sikh sentiments so please stop hounding me for nothing
4007867 we admit akshays beard shouldve been longer we added a scene where akshay says he made a mistake by trimming his beard and in the video with snoop dogg during the end titles he comes with a full beard albeit a false one
4007868 itd have taken akshay two years to grow a natural beard we had told the shiromani gurdwara prabandhak committee sgpc that the beard would be false and they had agreed
4007869 the opening of singh is kinng has been incredible business everywhere has been thundering but i can only rest easy after the first two weeks im glad that in spite of being a comedy singh is kinng isnt vulgar
4007870 i gave my director anees bazmi the freedom to do what he likes i only wanted him to tell a morally correct story i didnt want to flinch while watching it with my sons
4007871 akshay had a fierce cold while dubbing there was no way we could postpone so we used his nasal voice and akshay even added a line in the dialogue about his character having a terrible cold
4007872 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4007873 i blame our parents they have been married forever and have the best relationship and we have too much to live up to
4007874 way too fast its a new generation and its now time to step aside
4007875 they did a great job im from the previous generation with alex popov
4007876 ive raced many times against alain but i didnt know he was in my league we met before the races and hes a great guy and we have a good relationship im very happy with an ambassador like alain hes a great sportsman
4007877 its been a very long time my fourth olympics my fourth final in the 100 freestyle
4007878 the olympics is very special to me when i was 10 years old watching seoul watching matt biondi i got really inspired
4007879 i thought maybe it was possible to make history and win three times in a row but in 2005 i got really set back and started from zero
4007880 after eight long years and swimming three times in a row 47 seconds this is under my best i did in sydney its a big achievement for me personally im realising it now because a few minutes ago i was very very disappointed because i was close to the bronze its weird but i was only thinking about ways to win the race and that was impossible with guys like eamon and bernard
4007881 im going to take my rest now i deserve my rest

4007886 when you dont see people its almost impossible to know whats going on inside someone elses house
4007887 my problem with it is not so much the status of pluto
4007888 its not useful to do the kinds of science we do in solar system exploration it has no usefulness for people interested in understanding where geology occurs
4007889 when you have a decision based on a vote it is politics it is not science
4007890 pluto haters worked the political system to have a vote on a definition that would exclude pluto
4007891 the iau definition serves a very narrow segment of the astronomical community its not very useful for the rest of us
4007892 pluto was not big enough at its distance from the sun to have cleared its orbit so it was excluded
4007893 if you swapped jupiter and the earth the earth is no longer a planet
4007894 its like saying a fruit becomes a vegetable if you move it to the other side of the table what sense does that make why would the earths planethood depend on where it is located
4007895 people can see why this perspective is useful why that perspective is useful and which is more useful in something like teaching kids
4007896 its hard to absorb that information at first and then when you do you panic
4007897 what really surprised me is how thankful i was for what i do have
4007898 when i went to camp i saw a lot of kids with the same thing i had but they had amputations
4007899 i think this accentuated her character but it was there
4007900 we knew we would just have to fight it harder
4007901 im really looking forward to not being treated so special
4007902 weve been showing the martian panoramas from phoenix on the big screen and when we turn it to the three dimensional scenes you can hear them gasp
4007903 we try to get something new in each week so it is different each time
4007904 the georgian attack on south ossetia seeks to undermine russia which constitutes a significant countervailing military power and ally of iran
4007905 the emerging markets are a big part of our growth
4007906 dell will continue to grow faster than the rest of the industry certainly for the remainder of this year
4007907 its probably not significant now maybe 10 per cent of revenue if you look out more than two years its material that dell be in these markets
4007908 youve got about 500 000 new users coming on to the internet for the first time in their lives
4007909 there is nobody that is not affected one way or another by the drug situation
4007910 ive lost friends and family to drug addictions its everywhere you go and its destroying us
4007911 this movie is gonna show the negative effects of drugs and just how easy it is for young people to get involved in the business
4007912 it really tries to show what happens after the first time using it

4007915 our first day people came in and when they went back to the office they sent out e mails
4007916 its a lot nicer not having to be a pack mole
4007917 its nice to be able to go somewhere to buy a soda and chewing gum
4007918 people are overwhelmingly appreciative for us doing this even as young as we are everybody has been really understanding
4007919 first thing we did was an llc limited liability corporation second thing we did was write a business plan
4007920 we really have our heart in this place and our heart in downtown
4007921 this looks a lot nicer than simply convenient it feeds us for lunch
4007922 access to the public roads except on the 4 400 acres would not be disturbed
4007923 ive got a half million dollar house back there that could instantly be hard to give away
4007924 i have to go through lloyds of london to get my homeowners insurance because i dont have any fire department coverage
4007925 if i was going to vote today 80 20 id say go ahead and put in the mine
4007926 i had the ranch on the market before augusta resource came here
4007927 its not even a four wheel drive pickup road its like a jeep enthusiast type road where you really have to know what youre doing or else youll get yourself in trouble
4007928 it all depends on what comes out of the eis if thats going to be the final alignment or not
4007929 it can be buried its just going to take some specialty equipment and the costs are going to increase
4007930 we kind of figured if were building something it might as well be useful down the road
4007931 if they come to that pole its only 180 feet from my house
4007932 its going to be the bigger towers because we have to carry 138 kilovolt line

4007936 its so hard for the writers to just even get through the season theyre very good but its just the equivalent of making 12 films a year and then they have to come up with a whole new idea in the break for the next year
4007937 this is a truly momentous outcome for the company and our shareholders

4007960 we are looking forward to our battle with cameroon we are in the knock out stages where each game is a matter of survival
4007961 we respect cameroon and we are going to be prepared and try to play better than in the last game
4007962 this is an important game for brazil but it is not a day of destiny for ronaldinho
4007963 it is important because we have a dream of winning gold medals so we need to get past cameroon
4007964 we must put the benefit of the team first i cant keep all my famous players on the pitch all the time
4007965 we must take it seriously they have good players and a strong team
4007966 i am so proud to be part of this team i hope we can win another olympic gold
4007967 it will be a match between two african teams who are very familiar with each other
4007968 because of this i expect the performances from both sides to be excellent
4007969 the extradition procedure is difficult complicated and time consuming and we cannot predict the timetable
4007970 das team ist zwar besser als unser erstrundengegner nistru otaci wir sind aber ganz klar der favorit und wollen unbedingt weiterkommen
4007971 nat rlich haben wir respekt vor jedem gegner aber wenn wir die kader vergleichen sagen wir dass wir klar weiterkommen wollen
4007972 es wird kein selbstl ufer wenn wir denken das l uft schon dann wirds gef hrlich
4007973 den neuen coach bigon kenne ich gut ein verein der diesen trainer holen kann muss viel geld haben
4007974 the key is to not let them have the ball so well need to keep hold of it and move it around in the brazilian way
4007975 we have played together for a long time and the understanding on the pitch will always be there because we are such great friends off of it
4007976 if we are able to keep the ball and make norway chase us then me and cristiane can show our talent going forward
4007977 we are playing better football with every game and we are looking stronger just in time for the opponents to be getting stronger too
4007978 in athens we were a good team and we were well prepared
4007979 but we had a lot of the girls playing in their first big tournament there now we all have experience in big games and we know what it takes to win them
4007980 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
4007981 wir sind ganz klarer favorit wir haben das ganze jahr auf den uefa cup hingearbeitet jetzt ist es unser ziel diese runde zu berstehen
4007982 anschlie end haben wir eine kleine serie gestartet die f r den klassenerhalt grundlegend war
4007983 also werden zwei zun chst neutrale dinge miteinander verkn pft der betroffene glaubt dann oft auch unbewusst dass dieses prozedere zum erfolg f hrt
4007984 es sind schon sehr viele kollegen die einen kleinen spleen haben
4007985 das gibt mir r ckhalt w rde ich es nicht tun h tte ich ein ungutes gef hl
4007986 oft werden diese rituale vor dem wettkampf eingesetzt weil der spieler da besonders angespannt ist das ganz pers nliche ritual sch rft die konzentration es lenkt ab von st renden gedanken
4007987 ein bisschen quatsch machen bevors losgeht das stimmt mich positiv
4007988 je weniger sicherheit ein spieler hat desto mehr ben tigt er andere teilweise abstruse mittel um sich mental zu st rken
4007989 viele spieler wissen dass das was sie tun v llig irrational ist aber sie brauchen es trotzdem
4007990 wir sind stolz darauf dass es uns wieder gelungen ist bei hoher auslastung unsere profitabilit t nochmals zu steigern
4007991 umsatz vorsteuergewinn und berschuss lagen allesamt ber den sch tzungen

4007995 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
4007996 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
4007997 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
4007998 our ongoing work with this model and others should lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between climate and global hurricane activity
4007999 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
4008000 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
4008001 the traffic jams are very serious and many vehicles and passengers are stuck
4008002 local inhabitants face many difficulties because there is not enough food
4008003 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
4008004 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be the biggest environmental disaster of all time
4008005 its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
4008006 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
4008007 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
4008008 its quite possible that they will use this was support for their case but one cant determine that because a species is under less threat from extinction that its automatically okay to start hunting them
4008009 theres a lot of potential for developing the current stadium site and using the proceeds to pay for fixing it up
4008010 for example we could put a hotel at the south end of the field with suites that double as luxury boxes another option would be to put additional seating on the roof of the hotel similar to the seats outside of wrigley field in chicago certainly some of the valuable land around the stadium could be developed and used year round instead of as a parking lot ten times a year
4008011 people have always been fascinated by how some trees such as douglas fir or redwoods can grow so tall
4008012 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
4008013 higher and higher in the tree the valves are able to withstand more pulling force from the long heavy column of water before air bubbles can be sucked through
4008014 but the problem is that the valves become less efficient at letting water pass the height at which no water would pass at all according to our models coincides the tallest records for douglas fir about 350 to 400 feet
4008015 as you go higher and higher in a douglas fir tree its almost like experiencing a drought
4008016 and thats what we see at the tops of very tall trees the foliage is struggling to get enough water and seems to be under drought stress its not unusual to see periodic die back at the tops of very tall douglas fir trees that are near their height limits
4008017 up until now people thought that the tasmanian mega fauna had actually gone extinct before people arrived on the island
4008018 things were very climatically stable in that part of australia and yet the mega fauna still managed to go extinct
4008019 so its down to humans of one sort or another
4008020 a lot of people still have in their minds an axe wielding spear wielding people bloodthirsty out there slaughtering all over the place it wasnt like that at all
4008021 it was basically just one joey baby kangaroo in the pot for christmas and thats all youve got to go to do to drive slow breeding species to extinction
4008022 were concentrating time and space for the breeder so he can do the job in his lifetime
4008023 is a non hazardous and low cost technology that has the ability to address current challenges in agriculture
4008024 its about cutting through the gordian knot of food feed and fuel

4008027 and the last three holes i played at 3 under and that helped a lot
4008028 when i first started playing i thought it was going to be pretty boring
4008029 but then i hit a ball and i said whoa this is actually pretty fun
4008030 she reads well shes a major focuser she gets all the major lies but shes been burning the edges for the last six months
4008031 were in the middle now of changing her alignment and its hard
4008032 can you imagine a girl 14 and a boy 17 we have a nice member that gives us a time share at disney the marriott and they want to go there every single thanksgiving
4008033 i know she belongs there she definitely has what it takes but i have no idea how far she can go
4008034 to the international supporters and the financial backers of abbas or abu mazen as he is better known he is the good guy due to his moderation while hamas are considered the bad guys because of being islamic fundamentalists
4008035 however the behaviour of the pna is not lost on the palestinian population as the pna continues to lose support the pna leadership is worried about hamas taking over in the west bank
4008036 to a large degree hamas has managed to establish law and order on the streets of gaza and kidnappings have ceased
4008037 they are regarded as clean politically not corrupt like fatah
4008038 underscore this eleventh hour bid to save the nations greatest river
4008039 it sent a very clear message by saying weve had a lot of talk about the river system a lot of science we all know what the problem is we just want politicians to have the will to fix it up
4008040 they need to secure water upstream and send it down
4008041 ug99 first occurred in uganda in 1999 its now in iran and closing in on asia
4008042 most crops in asias major wheat growing areas are vulnerable to ug99 so if it gets to these areas food shortages and famine could result ug99 could also pose a bio security threat to australia
4008043 wheat varieties worldwide including those in australia rely on only a few rust resistance genes to protect them from different strains of rust but most of these resistance genes provide little protection against ug99 and derived strains
4008044 the challenge is to now identify and deploy more multiple resistance gene combinations that protect wheat against ug99 or find other ways to protect wheat from this fungus
4008045 participating in a co ordinated international consortium is the best way to find solutions to this potential global threat
4008046 it is estimated that there will be a global warming of 1 to 6 degrees by the end of the century and we examined how this could manifest at smaller spatial scales and within shorter time periods
4008047 we identified areas likely to be most responsive to changes in greenhouse gas emissions this study provides information at the state scale as opposed to a global or regional average which could be useful for climate change policy
4008048 one interesting and surprising result is that we see the same hotspot patterns even at lower greenhouse gas concentrations
4008049 this suggests that we may be able to see these hotspots emerging already

4008054 wir haben heute jeden tag 100 000 autos weniger in der stadt als vor einf hrung der geb hr
4008055 im februar 2003 gab es in london lediglich 90 elektroautos im juni 2008 waren es mehr als 1600
4008056 die briten kaufen etwa doppelt so viele hybrid autos wie die deutschen und die meisten davon fahren in london
4008057 allein im vergangenen jahr haben wir 250 fahrzeuge auf die stra e gebracht in diesem jahr sollen es deutlich mehr werden
4008058 alles in allem also der coolste billigste und bequemste weg um durch die stadt zu kommen
4008059 wir h tten problemlos mehr autos auf die stra e bringen k nnen
4008060 die leasinggeb hr ist etwa viermal so hoch wie f r einen vergleichbaren smart benziner

4008116 pseudo realists believe we can operate in the world alone
4008117 my sense is that the realism of dwight david eisenhower and richard nixon and brent scowcroft and you operate within the confines of international law and work with allies i think that is the kind of realism that most americans agree with and obama understands
4008118 the effort behind the movement is to get republicans to vote for obama

4008122 a withdrawal of american forces at this point in time is too unrealistic an american presence will be required in iraq for an undetermined amount of time
4008123 since we are succeeding then i am convinced as i have said before we can withdraw and withdraw with honor not according to a set timetable and im confident that is what prime minister maliki is talking about since he has told me that for many meetings we ve had
4008124 let me give you a hypothetical senator what would or should we do if in the post june 30th period a so called sovereign iraqi government asks us to leave even if we are unhappy about the security situation there i understand its a hypothetical but its at least possible
4008125 well if that scenario evolves then i think its obvious that we would have to leave because if it was an elected government of iraq and weve been asked to leave other places in the world if it were an extremist government then i think we would have other challenges but i dont see how we could stay when our whole emphasis and policy has been based on turning the iraqi government over to the iraqi people
4008126 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq

4008128 the longer a suspect lingers around whatever you sell the more of their own imagination they add and the closer they shift into selling and closing themselves the key is the give people a reason to sit within your sales funnel for as long as possible

4008167 the other night joe saunders didnt shake me off at all
4008168 he just kept getting the ball back and throwing that sinker and he gave us a good rhythm but yeah its something to be proud of to know that you and the pitcher are on the same page
4008169 but everybody wants to play every day and i think it helps me as a hitter you see more pitchers and you can feel a lot better as a catcher it can be tough physically but i do a lot of extra stretching beforehand try to get extra rest this is why you do all that work
4008170 hes probably spoken up more in our meetings over the past two weeks than he has all year
4008171 the whole program here is designed to call the right pitch
4008172 ive been working on it since i went to provo orem utah for rookie league ive had to learn the hitters you look at their foot position you remember how you pitched them the first two times they came up and you talk with the pitchers about where they want you to set up every one might have a different place they want you to be for every pitch and every situation
4008173 but then where do you find your best athletes in football and basketball usually its shortstop and quarterback
4008174 then i got drafted a lot higher 33rd pick first round 2001 than i ever thought i would so it was a no brainer to play baseball
4008175 i just liked catching because you were so involved in every play as far as football goes i got so much out of it getting rattled having to come back and size everything up make the right play it was so important to my career its hard to describe

4008220 some of those pitches he was getting himself out on he had a strike on him in that last at bat but he did what he does he got one up in there air and when he gets it up in the air they travel for him
4008221 he hit it so high that when it was coming down it was near the backside of the fence
4008222 i gave it all i could but we cant dwell on this loss you win some you lose some and weve been winning more than weve been losing a loss like this can keep us humble
4008223 the angels usually find a way to win and thats what we need to do not just be satisfied to play with teams of that caliber
4008224 thats what rigglemans been stressing to us every game that were capable of being a really good team
4008225 i dont make those decisions but i wasnt getting nobody out
4008226 i wasnt locating my pitches and i was falling behind every single hitter so at that point theres not much i could have done because i already gave up the lead it was a really embarrassing outing for me i didnt get the job done
4008227 i asked him a simple question where was the pitch on the first batter i didnt like the way he responded and i exploded
4008228 but no excuses it has nothing to do with that i still had to make quality pitches and get the other guys out and i didnt
4008229 our approach against him was to try to do less just put easy swings on him and try to get guys on base
4008230 reeds game tying hit that was a tough pitch against the best closer in the game and that was a huge at bat for us
4008231 hes swinging the bat well and tonight showed hes a clutch hitter
4008232 i didnt feel sharp the last time i pitched here
4008233 i wanted to be aggressive and stay aggressive that really worked out i feel like if i stick to my game plan it sets me up for success
4008234 his last two outings are as good as ive seen him in a long time hes always been a winner
4008235 its important to focus on the present this is a young team but weve behaved maturely and it happened naturally were able to handle things
4008236 we had first and third nobody out and dont score
4008237 thats a big blow we tried to force some contact there and push a run across and thats about it its difficult to win when youre not getting enough runs
4008238 two solo home runs i didnt feel like it was going to beat me i battled through it got into the seventh and had a little bit of an unfortunate bounce on the last hitter and that ended up costing us the game

4008264 its no longer gonna be looked at as a basketball school coach cutcliffe has a very good plan for the team their program will be turned around tremendously i wanna be a part of that
4008265 at the end of the day it was too much of an educational opportunity to pass up and i really like and respect the coaching staff and what they can do for me
4008266 i visited duke today and i was very impressed with everything i saw the coaches are very committed and capable of making the kind of changes that need to happen in the program after visiting there i can really see myself playing for them for the next few years
4008267 as of right now i have not committed anywhere before this visit i was thinking about doing it after my season but now i think itll be done before my senior year so i can enjoy that last ride

4008294 the police arrived and took four aggressors and three injured victims with them for interrogation but afterwards released all of them
4008295 traditional authorities have to do now what the mpla says not all do this willingly but he who resists loses his bread
4008296 if we say the truth we are accused of being on the side of unita
4008297 the government should allow voters and opposition parties in cabinda to express their opinions freely if they are to have confidence in the electoral process
4008298 it is essential that all journalists are allowed to operate freely
4008299 all politically motivated charges and other threats against journalists or media outlets should be withdrawn to allow them to do their job without official hindrance
4008300 the central voter register seems to be property of the cipe and the government
4008301 involving civil society in observing the elections for the first time is a major new step for angola and its vital to enhance trust in the process
4008302 the electoral commission should respect recommendations and complaints from domestic observers it should also encourage civil society groups to observe the polls and get involved in voter education
4008303 election observers should remain vigilant about procedural flaws but should also monitor freedom of expression and intimidation of opposition activists
4008304 the observers should issue urgent statements about any problems they find so that they can be corrected before the voting begins

4008307 our same store sales remained strong both in the philippines and abroad while our profit was lower compared to last year due to rapidly increasing costs we believe that eventually our profit will also grow as jfc had done in previous years of high inflation rate and slowing economic growth

4008313 em novembro do ano passado fui informado de que existia uma opera o encomendada na pol cia federal diziam que isso tinha sido pedido pelo diretor da abin doutor paulo lacerda e que isso ocorria como uma retalia o ao fato de doutor paulo lacerda me atribuir a responsabilidade por ter entregado a uma revista de grande prest gio um relat rio que constava contas do exterior que lhes foram atribu das
4008314 me lembro do termo que dizia que ele paulo lacerda iria me colocar um par de algemas
4008315 da a folha de s paulo publicou uma mat ria de 26 de abril coincidentemente no dia seguinte assinatura do contrato da brasil telecom com a telemar dizia que 20 e poucas pessoas tinham pedido de pris o dif cil que a folha de s paulo permita a publica o com elemento totalmente especulativo a eu fiquei preocupado
4008316 ela nunca escreveu nada que fosse do nosso interesse acho uma leviandade absoluta levantar suspeita sobre essa jornalista
4008317 tinha sido uma opera o articulada pelos mesmos participantes que trabalhavam para a telecom it lia para impedir o acordo da venda da brasil telecom para a telemar

4008357 the talk circulating from teams overseas what theyre willing to do as athletes you have to listen
4008358 i think as a basketball level there is not a great difference between euroleague and the nba
4008359 when you have some teams moving faster than nba teams and showing more interest and they offer you the possibility to be the main guy and have more playing time and have the ball in your hands and at the same time its economics thats a strong thing
4008360 thats the situation for players like childress and me and guys moving to europe we think its a good situation right now
4008361 in fact we see this as a positive indication of how popular the sport of basketball is on a global basis

4008419 the people were so emotionally involved if you asked them whats the most moving episode i think the majority would tell you that moment with the little girl in red clothes now the chinese people feel they are fooled the psychological hurt is enormous

4008432 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
4008433 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
4008434 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
4008435 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
4008436 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
4008437 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
4008438 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
4008439 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
4008440 professional guidance for a happier life is unavailable as yet this is a remarkable market failure given the large number of people who feel they could be happier

4008453 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4008454 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4008455 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4008456 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4008457 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4008458 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4008459 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4008460 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4008461 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4008462 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4008463 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4008464 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4008465 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4008466 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4008482 if you have any child and he disrupts the service or meeting you take the child out out of consideration for others
4008483 what i really dont understand is why mentally handicapped people arent punished
4008484 this is one of those catch 22 situations where no side is going to win
4008485 not sure why carol race insists on subjecting her son to an environment hes clearly not comfortable with

4008488 they all want to play too theyre not coming in here looking to redshirt
4008489 i dont have to do that now you know im getting effort and im getting toughness so you know it makes it a lot easier
4008490 youve got to play hard youve got to be tough hard nosed you cant take plays off when its hard youve got to play harder when it gets tougher youve got to keep going find something to keep going you cant slack off

4008516 this project further underscores the partnership between esri and i cubed and is a great demonstration of the utility of the datadoors platform in providing a simplified delivery mechanism for any type of data
4008517 datadoors for arcgis will give arcgis users the ability to acquire and store on a local machine useful data that will greatly aid them with their gis projects and analysis we are excited about offering this capability to our customers

4008541 but the position is being monitored in light of market conditions

4008600 eso de que es una bell sima persona es una frase que me suena much simo la utilizan los agresores para defender a otros agresores
4008601 ella est en la fase terminal del maltrato la del sometimiento la negaci n de la evidencia la incapacidad de reaccionar ante el drama tiene una dependencia ciega de su maltratador
4008602 lo nico que quiero es que se le haga a su pareja un examen m dico porque est n cayendo muchas calumnias y mentiras sobre nosotros
4008603 si estuviese convencida de lo que dice ya hubiese explicado al juez que lo ocurrido hab a sido una confusi n
4008604 se trata de una mujer que ha sido maltratada durante mucho tiempo a pesar de eso saca la cara por l quedando en evidencia ante todo el mundo
4008605 esta mujer da much sima pena no compartimos lo que ha dicho pero la comprendemos ahora le falta tener la confianza suficiente en s misma para salir de la situaci n
4008606 para ellas es normal recibir un trato negativo un azote un insulto la mayor a han sido tratadas as por su padre y ahora lo asumen de su marido
4008607 para ganar a un equipo como ste hay que tener 4 partes brillantes
4008608 oh great just what i needed another newman blocking my way up the corporate ladder
4008609 imagine what we could achieve if we didnt care who got the credit
4008610 in my heart are two wolves fighting for control which one will win
4008611 i had the best day ever got to make something with real cool fabric ate good food alex brother wasnt there to pick on her and the shop is air conditioned
4008612 of today were probably the biggest rubber shoes fad of that time these shoes were so big that it evolved into a sub brand today the jordan brand
4008613 i cant play no worse than i did last night
4008614 i had so much fun doing this but i feel that i must include my train of thought on how i was inspired
4008615 i would like to get to know someone that is approximately my height it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
4008616 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4008617 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4008618 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
4008619 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
4008620 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
4008621 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
4008622 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
4008623 i have two kids im worried about so i have other priorities
4008624 were already experiencing that in traffic congestion in schools and in our crowded coastal areas
4008625 weve been showing the martian panoramas from phoenix on the big screen and when we turn it to the three dimensional scenes you can hear them gasp
4008626 we try to get something new in each week so it is different each time
4008627 he chose the decision he made was to take my daughters life i think he totally hated her
4008628 he hated her because she had everything and he had nothing
4008629 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4008630 its hard to absorb that information at first and then when you do you panic
4008631 what really surprised me is how thankful i was for what i do have
4008632 when i went to camp i saw a lot of kids with the same thing i had but they had amputations
4008633 i think this accentuated her character but it was there
4008634 we knew we would just have to fight it harder
4008635 im really looking forward to not being treated so special
4008636 my problem with it is not so much the status of pluto
4008637 its not useful to do the kinds of science we do in solar system exploration it has no usefulness for people interested in understanding where geology occurs
4008638 when you have a decision based on a vote it is politics it is not science
4008639 pluto haters worked the political system to have a vote on a definition that would exclude pluto
4008640 the iau definition serves a very narrow segment of the astronomical community its not very useful for the rest of us
4008641 pluto was not big enough at its distance from the sun to have cleared its orbit so it was excluded
4008642 if you swapped jupiter and the earth the earth is no longer a planet
4008643 its like saying a fruit becomes a vegetable if you move it to the other side of the table what sense does that make why would the earths planethood depend on where it is located
4008644 people can see why this perspective is useful why that perspective is useful and which is more useful in something like teaching kids
4008645 oh its already 6 30 and i still have to take a shower eat breakfast and get gas
4008646 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
4008647 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
4008648 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars
4008649 it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
4008650 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins
4008651 i bought four or five rolls of coins each month
4008652 i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now and then
4008653 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
4008654 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
4008655 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4008656 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
4008657 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
4008658 he came up and started stabbing her immediately without any words or argument
4008659 he did not stop his murderous acts voluntarily but because of the heroic acts of the neighbor
4008660 access to the public roads except on the 4 400 acres would not be disturbed

4008663 if i was going to vote today 80 20 id say go ahead and put in the mine
4008664 i had the ranch on the market before augusta resource came here
4008665 its not even a four wheel drive pickup road its like a jeep enthusiast type road where you really have to know what youre doing or else youll get yourself in trouble
4008666 it all depends on what comes out of the eis if thats going to be the final alignment or not
4008667 it can be buried its just going to take some specialty equipment and the costs are going to increase
4008668 we kind of figured if were building something it might as well be useful down the road
4008669 if they come to that pole its only 180 feet from my house
4008670 its going to be the bigger towers because we have to carry 138 kilovolt line

4008704 the six month period since commencement of the companys investment activity has been a particularly volatile one for global equity markets
4008705 our strategy has been to gradually invest in selected equities as value has emerged
4008706 i am particularly pleased that we have been able to report a level of return well above the level generated from a portfolio consisting solely of cash over the period
4008707 whilst price falls in equity markets have improved relative value broader concerns for the global economy overshadow the outlook for positive returns
4008708 however the volatility that this environment produces can present us with attractive opportunities the underlying fundamentals of western australia remain generally sound and our concentration on companies with some connection to this economy underpins their activity
4008709 we remain focused on investing in a small number of situations where we have a high conviction in the prospect for attractive medium to long term returns

4008761 das hat mich damals nicht aus der bahn geworfen und das wird es auch jetzt nicht tun
4008762 in vier jahren bei olympia in london bin ich wieder dabei versprochen
4008763 ich bef rchte dass uns das sehr beeintr chtigen wird
4008764 vielleicht haben wir ja das gl ck dass trotzdem alles zusammenpasst
4008765 ich hoffe dass das schlechte gewissen ihn nach vorne treibt und er uns diesmal hilft
4008766 wir haben mehrere alternativen wir arbeiten daran wir wollen es machen wir werden es machen
4008767 mit der strategischen beteiligung an mlp wollen wir unsere position in der unabh ngigen finanzberatung im deutschen markt zus tzlich st rken und die zusammenarbeit intensivieren
4008768 wir sind mit den verantwortlichen von mlp in kontakt derzeit streben wir ohne einvernehmen mit mlp keinen ausbau unserer beteiligung an
4008769 we have a long experience with parental control software and our content filtering engine is recognized as the best for mac were looking forward to working closely with contentwatch on net nanny for mac
4008770 in response to our customers requests and the rapid growth of the mac market we felt we needed to extend our top rated range of parental control solutions to mac os x
4008771 it was clear that intego was the best partner to work with given their experience the quality of their technology and their adaptability
4008772 nobody anticipated that such dynamics would generate a real civil war dynamic that saw heightened inter ethnic animosity which threatened to tear apart not just security agencies
4008773 public perceptions that the political leaders were much more interested in their personal welfare and the pursuit of lavish lifestyles cemented the view that the government was out of touch with the economic reality of the most vulnerable
4008774 in a sense the seeds for the ethnic stereotyping and mobilisation that gave birth to post election violence were sown way back in 2005
4008775 ich verstehe nicht was sie f r eine sprache sprechen
4008776 ik zou een waardeloze sportman zijn als ik hier met een glimlach zou rondlopen
4008777 maar ik heb alles uit mijn mogelijkheden gehaald mijn onderrug is versleten en daardoor mis ik explosiviteit bij de start en het keerpunt
4008778 we are very excited to be incorporating the vision technology and products of knowledgewhere into the useful networks portfolio of location based services
4008779 knowledgewheres access to great technology and their long tenure in location aware advertising and gaming complement our portfolio of services nicely
4008780 the decision to move forward with useful networks will undoubtedly provide both companies with more resources technology and development
4008781 we are pleased and excited to be a part of the useful networks family
4008782 ich habe bis zum schluss gefightet es hat nicht gereicht jetzt muss ich erstmal mit meinem trainer analysieren woran es gelegen hat
4008783 der posten des sportdirektors m ller muss als konsequenz aus dem schlechten sportlichen abschneiden bei olympia neu besetzt werden auch die verbandsspitze um pr sident kaidel muss zur cktreten
4008784 aus ganz bitteren niederlagen sind schon gro e sieger hervorgegangen
4008785 im his dad and this aint the way the rules are
4008786 the rules are that children are supposed to bury their daddy
4008787 no other country has experienced such rapid racial and ethnic change
4008788 a momentum is built into this as a result of past immigration
4008789 in the 1970s 80s and 90s there were more hispanic immigrants than births this decade there are more births than immigrants almost regardless of what you assume about future immigration the country will be more hispanic and asian
4008790 whats happening now in terms of increasing diversity probably is unprecedented
4008791 within the conventional definition of race of white black asian minority vs non minority this is a big change
4008792 the way people report race 20 or 30 years from now may be very different
4008793 one officer asked me in english what were my views of tibet
4008794 i told him i was a journalist and didnt have any views
4008795 one of our chinese staff asked why they arrested me and an officer said didnt you see
4008796 pointing to the yellow cloth they had thrown into the van
4008797 i was there merely to report not to take part in anything i didnt have a banner i didnt have a t shirt i was wearing pretty standard foreign correspondent garb
4008798 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4008799 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4008800 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4008801 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4008802 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4008803 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4008804 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4008805 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4008806 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4008807 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4008808 as we move forward the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions
4008809 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia
4008810 but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
4008811 i can tell you that recent developments between russia and georgia give us no proof that dmitry medvedev is an independent leader
4008812 one scene was very clear when putin began to tell the president what to do it was not a private conversation putin wanted to show that he was in charge
4008813 no one thought about a session of duma no one even bothered
4008814 we have been under siege for the last two years
4008815 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4008816 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4008817 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4008818 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen
4008819 the road is likely to remain closed for a considerable period of time

4008829 i will discuss with assistant secretary hill negotiations with the north on how to draw up a verification mechanism
4008830 im also planning to discuss wrapping up the second stage of nuclear disarmament
4008831 we understand that japan and north korea agreed to the basic outline of a resolution to the abduction issue and to steps for eventual removal of some japanese sanctions on the dprk north korea
4008832 i have never imagined that i could win the gold in the olympic games
4008833 my first thought after i touched the wall was wow ive won an olympic final
4008834 its a new generation and now its time to step aside

4008845 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
4008846 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
4008847 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
4008848 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
4008849 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
4008850 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
4008851 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
4008852 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
4008853 professional guidance for a happier life is unavailable as yet this is a remarkable market failure given the large number of people who feel they could be happier

4008935 we all want this movie to go into production as soon as possible its a fast tracked movie lionsgate felt the process was enhanced by having a second team come in and do a script
4008936 fans expect these types of movies to be more true to the source material theres no reason there couldnt be a conan movie every two years hes almost like batman hes a dark hero hes a hard hero he has to be badass but we also have to like him
4008937 but i surprised myself the makers of the show called me back and i thought ive given so much to this show so i just cant say no to it so here i am all charged up
4008938 i have fantastic in laws and a great support system at home so i dont have to worry about deanne also the shooting schedule is such that i am able to spend maximum time with her

4008941 if our bees were to come in touch with the genetically modified maize and the honey was contaminated with it we would not be allowed to sell it
4008942 it is well known that bees live 90 percent of their lives in a perimeter of three kilometres
4008943 but bees can fly up to 10 kilometres without any problem now we are really happy that the city of munich has granted our bees asylum
4008944 until the end of the summer by mid august the maize bloom period is over and the bees can go back home
4008945 but in some regions as in brandenburg around berlin it is almost impossible to flee from gmcs genetically modified crops
4008946 the gmcs are everywhere and bees come in touch with them one place or other
4008947 after some good weeks in spring bees are threatened by famine because later in the year there are almost no more blooming flowers
4008948 you can see that in vast regions especially in the eastern part of the country there is nothing for bees to feed on
4008949 we found abundant traces of clothianidin in the bees bodies
4008950 today it is easier for bees to live in the cities because the recreational green areas and courtyards have exuberant varied vegetation which blossoms over several months from early in the spring to the end of the summer
4008951 in the cities bees have only a couple of hundred metres to fly from a public garden to a balcony to a courtyard to find luscious flowers and mostly free of insecticides
4008952 my marriage will definitely not be like anything they show on tv i feel bad for the actress who has to wear heavy jewellery and sit though it all

4008954 see theres something called editing even if theres an ugly fight on the show its upto the producers and director to decide whether to air it or not they can simply chop off that and show the rest but thats not what they want
4008955 a good production house is a blessing for any actor the barjatyas are the sweetest people to work with they take good care of their actors
4008956 i love talking i am an extrovert and keeping quiet for a long time is not me

4008972 it is clear that despite the impressive political energy and resources focused on education iod members believe the government has generally performed poorly in this critical arena
4008973 it is probably impossible to determine definitively the extent to which education services have improved or otherwise over the last decade however the analysis conducted for the briefing book suggests that we approach official statistics with caution this matters education and skills are a key driver of productivity and vital to the uks competitiveness even at face value the official figures illustrate a need for a step change in performance to meet future skill needs the true international challenge could be even greater
4008974 the six procurement hubs recognised that their requirements for it equipment were common it made sense therefore to take full advantage of this excellent opportunity to collaborate
4008975 ogcbuying solutions was brought in at an early stage and helped to facilitate the collaboration and assisted with the procurement nhs connecting for health were approached to input into the technical aspects of the procurement and to ensure alignment with the nhs national programme for it
4008976 from the outset the hubs were keen to work together to aggregate their volumes and to apply their joint buying power in the marketplace
4008977 buying solutions provided the facilitation and project management for the procurement as well as advice and guidance but without doubt the hard work was done by the hubs themselves
4008978 this has laid the foundations for future collaborative work between the nhs ogcbuying solutions and the wider public sector
4008979 this project involving the procurement of 52 000 desktops and 8 500 laptops has enabled us to build on the successes of individual hubs to share expertise and to achieve a great deal for our nhs trusts
4008980 collaboration is nothing new to the cphs however a collaboration exercise of this scale consisting of a team of individuals from six different regional organisations representing 220 nhs trusts was a significant challenge we all recognised we have been able to put aside local agendas in order to successfully construct a deal with our suppliers and deliver real benefit to the nhs
4008981 we are sending out a clear message to the market that nhs regions are working together to get the best possible deals
4008982 we hope this will set the pattern for future projects together with my counterparts in other regions we hope to identify other areas from which a collaborative approach will bring greater benefits to our respective member trusts

4008985 complying with legislation can be complex at times but employment law is often easier than business owners think
4008986 for example producing written statements of employment is a significant burden for employers in both time and money and many businesses are paying external advisers to draw these up for them in the last year however over 40 000 firms have benefited from switching to the written statement tool we have provided each of them saving around 120 every time that they do so
4008987 this is a welcome campaign offering businesses helpful advice about how they can cut down on admin associated with employing people small firms in particular will appreciate the governments support and guidance being in one place with the free tools a cost effective way to reduce time spent calculating things like sick pay
4008988 in tougher economic times employers cant afford to throw away money by getting caught up doing unnecessary paperwork so we welcome the governments moves to help employers to save money and time on their employment law obligations thats why we are playing a key role in helping design and develop the tools and guidance on the businesslink gov website to make sure that it offers just what businesses need
4008989 our members particularly if they are smaller firms always struggle with employment law anything that the government can do to promote simple guidance that cuts out unnecessary expense and paperwork is most welcome the employing people campaign was promoted at our national conference this year and we will be helping to roll out a series of regional seminars over the coming months
4008990 in addition to the strong partnership that we have with the largest integrators in saudi arabia we are looking to recruit performance based resellers backed up by a strong value added distributor who will work closely with us to promote our solutions extensively in the local market

4009044 at the 80 metres mark i was hurting but i told myself hang on hang on i did what my coach told me dont panic
4009045 even in the last five metres i knew it was very tight and that i wouldnt win until i had my hand on the wall i already had a race where someone got there just before me i didnt want it to happen again
4009046 my first thought was thats it ive won the final it is so hard to believe
4009047 i took it to heart i was the last guy and it was on my shoulder
4009048 he deserves a lot of the credit this win is a credit to his professionalism and hard work

4009057 non ho un barlume di simpatia per chi parla dal punto di vista del culto organizzato le religioni non sono altro che corporation strumenti di potere politico e finanziario senza relazione con il dio che professano di servire si travestono con costumi bislacchi per dispensare precetti e causare guerre non ho allevato nessuno dei miei figli secondo le tradizioni ebraiche e non so neppure quando cadono le feste sono un antisemita no penso solo che il mondo sarebbe assai migliore senza religione
4009058 come se la ragione di tanti sprechi inefficienze ingiustizie cancrene fosse lassistenzialismo in s lo stato del benessere in s legualitarismo in s e non gli abusi le illegalit luso spregiudicato e clientelare che si fatto in italia di questi strumenti per altro mai posti alla base delle nostre scelte di politica economica

4009068 they wanted someone to get on the road and work with dealers and i started right away talking to different turkey barns and cattle and hog barns construction yards foundries and ship unloading companies it was nonstop
4009069 i believe that the real reason that most divorces happen is due to the fact that we dont know how to communicate with each other about money we dont know how to talk about money to our spouses and loved ones it is like a secret behind close doors to talk about money we are afraid to share that we spent more then we should have to our spouses we are afraid to share our true feelings about money

4009266 i lost about 20 pounds but it was in the offseason
4009267 i had no idea that i was diabetic at all i was diagnosed got myself on a plan controlling my insulin and meals and visit terry freis blog on all things colorado sports exercise
4009268 but the discipline it takes to play quarterback physically mentally and emotionally is the same way you have to go about treating your diabetes you have to be mentally tough and physically strong and go about managing it the way you manage football
4009269 they didnt have the pump when i was first diagnosed

4009280 we are seeing more and more websites becoming infected we count 16 000 new malicious web pages every day its one every five seconds and 90 of them are on legitimate sites that have been hacked
4009281 a lot of that will be the bad guys setting up blogs with malicious content but some of them will also be sites that have been hacked
4009282 as bloggers have updated to the patched version of wordpress we have seen the number of hacked blogs drop accordingly

4009407 die patienten sind dann oft froh dass sie ihre alte brille oder ihre kontaktlinsen auch nach der op noch weiterverwenden k nnen
4009408 doch h tten sie sich einer unserer high end linsen einsetzen lassen br uchten sie in der regel gar keine brille mehr
4009409 wenn sie etwa eine laser op zur korrektur der kurzsichtigkeit hatten werden sie wenn sp ter die altersweitsichtigkeit eintritt doch wieder eine brille brauchen mit unseren linsen br uchten sie die nicht
4009410 denn unsere linsen sind flexibel sie lassen sich von der augenmuskulatur bewegen das hei t das ph momen der fortschreitenden altersweitsichtigkeit ist praktisch gebannt
4009411 stellen sie sich vor sie lassen sich mit 60 eine standardlinse einsetzen sind aber nach zehn jahren nicht mehr zufrieden damit
4009412 wir sind die ersten die eine zusatzlinse anbieten frei nach dem motto mit der zweiten sieht man besser
4009413 wer sich zum beispiel bei einer grauen star op eine unserer high end linsen einsetzen lassen m chte wird als kassenpatient alles selbst bezahlen m ssen op und linsen kostenpunkt rund 1 750 euro pro auge
4009414 eine standardlinse wird dagegen auch von den gesetzlichen bezahlt inklusive op
4009415 das ist f r viele menschen attraktiv und da sehen wir in deutschland einen gro es potenzial
4009416 bis patienten damit so gut sehen k nnen k nnen dass sie b cher lesen k nnen wird es sicher noch f nf jahre dauern
4009417 doch sie k nnen mit dem implantat zumindest umrisse wie t ren oder fenster wieder wahrnehmen das ist f r viele schon ein ganz gro er fortschritt
4009418 bisher gab es f r menschen die sich die iris verletzten keine vern nftige l sung die funktioniert und mit denen das auge auch wieder aussieht wie vor der verletzung
4009419 heroism on command senseless violence and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism how passionately i hate them
4009420 this is the next step to finally grabbing that golden key and opening whatever it is that it opens
4009421 fuck i dont have enough shit with that brand name on it that i can parade around in so thats what ill spend my money on what a no brainer
4009422 i need to take a pause why the fuck is this happening my world is crumbling down around me
4009423 they do not seem to be based on any solid evidence
4009424 our experience from over 10 years of gm cultivation shows that gm technology has been found to deliver real environmental and economic benefits
4009425 even for a prince whos a long established champion of organic farming and critic of gm crops these are comments which verge on the extreme
4009426 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
4009427 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
4009428 that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
4009429 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
4009430 safety will always be our top priority on this issue
4009431 prince charles is quickly making his position as heir to the throne untenable with his meddling in politics
4009432 we respect his privacy and we very much hope for the best and our prayers are with him and his family
4009433 bahwa yang dilarang itu adalah minta syafaat kepada mayit dan orang mati
4009434 dan tanyakanlah kepada rasul rasul kami yang telah kami utus sebelum kamu
4009435 dan janganlah kamu mengatakan terhadap orang orang yang gugur di jalan allah bahwa mereka itu mati bahkan sebenarnya mereka itu hidup tetapi kamu tidak menyadarinya

4009440 my shoulder just stiffened up on me when i started facing mauer
4009441 i was trying to overthrow and it got progressively worse and worse the more pitches i threw
4009442 you know when you have a tetanus shot and you have that ache deep in there like somebody just punched you in the shoulder thats kind of the feeling
4009443 ive had it in the past and you usually have to just give it time to rest and you can bounce back pretty well
4009444 obviously im concerned i had to come out of a ballgame and i didnt do my job hopefully tomorrow the doc will have some good news
4009445 they said he threw the ball pretty decent but there are still some things he needs to work on
4009446 hes building arm strength and getting closer to where he has to be
4009447 i could have been out there but i dont know how effective i would have been
4009448 it would have been worse defensively going side to side
4009449 it just hit me in the face because i was so tired
4009450 i couldnt even pick my hands up to catch it thats when i knew right there i need to work on endurance a little bit
4009451 i didnt want to go through that again where i had to get in shape during the season i wanted to build up my endurance before the season
4009452 so this offseason i ran long and over hills more so than in the last couple of years i didnt do too much weightlifting because i didnt want to be as heavy as i was last summer or the summers before i was just concentrating on my wind this summer
4009453 it was a pretty stand upish after what happened to my leg
4009454 derrick ward gives you the shiftiness that weve had in the past
4009455 great out of the backfield good in third down situations takes care of the quarterback real well
4009456 we talk about it all the time but its really out of our hands
4009457 we have to show the giants or another team what we can do im just going to be here working my hardest trying to get that long term deal so i can finish it up here with one team
4009458 i didnt get to keep that ball somebody else did
4009459 my game is left center thats what got me here
4009460 we need to get better its getting pretty late for us
4009461 it was a bad trip you cant sugar coat it
4009462 you can say we should have won this game or we had an opportunity to win that game but the bottom line is we didnt win very many games
4009463 there were a lot of close games and we didnt find a way to win those now we have to fight more time is not on our side like it was much earlier
4009464 im more familiar with comments like this is the time to show what were made of or champions are built on overcoming adversity like this
4009465 i was a little surprised by it im not criticizing hank but it seems like it would be more steinbrenner like if he were to challenge them
4009466 i dont remember george saying something like that publicly but i remember plenty of times george telling us we stunk some of his meetings he really read us the riot act hed say something like you guys stink and hed be right we did
4009467 if we dont make it this year im not going to explode
4009468 were going to win it next year if we need to add a top veteran pitcher well do that well do whatever we need to do next year well be extremely dangerous
4009469 i dont think we should automatically expect hank to be a clone
4009470 he may think this is a rallying cry that itll make the players say are you kidding were not out of this yet
4009471 it opened our eyes as coaches so im kind of glad that happened
4009472 i would like for people to try and exploit things in the preseason i think that helps us
4009473 its something that were probably going to see a whole lot more of this year
4009474 guys will roll out and try to stay away from the front four
4009475 i think a lot of that rests on the defensive coordinator
4009476 he has to find a way to put us in position to make the plays were supposed to make if teams are doing one thing you have to find a way to counter thats what hes done for us
4009477 obviously with the success we had last year with the pass rush of this football team thats something were going to have to combat
4009478 marques felt it would be in his best interest to take advantage of an opportunity somewhere else
4009479 he definitely has handled himself with as much class as anybody that ive been around since he has been at n c state
4009480 you have an established team like the patriots then you have three other teams with a lot of new players
4009481 i definitely see us as a playoff contender theres no reason why we wont be we had that type of attitude going into camp and we feel that as long as we do all the right things well be in good shape
4009482 i feel great its a great feeling knowing that im able to go out there and do everything im supposed to do i cant wait for the regular season games to start
4009483 you could tell its been a long time i definitely need the work but it was good to be out there and get a feel of a real game
4009484 paul is a guy whose love of the game is pretty apparent
4009485 hes never a miserable human being to be around not even last year when he was going through something that was very difficult for him he was always pleasant and interesting to talk to he loves to play football
4009486 im here if you want me to stay with you do you want me to stay
4009487 do you want me to go play baseball the son asked
4009488 i did everything possible but i was never home and thats what hurt
4009489 as close as we were i didnt feel like i was there enough but if i was there it would have happened anyway because god has a date for everybody
4009490 getting hurt in the first game after all that rehabbing was a shock he said
4009491 and then my dad i couldnt get my mind off him
4009492 i dont know if im going to end up doing what im supposed to do like i did in boston in the last year
4009493 but like anything else with petey mets general manager omar minaya said
4009494 the arm is great the velocity is fine so far he hasnt had command the walks the home runs are because of command and the only way he gets that back is if he gets on the mound and pitches its going to come
4009495 if hes healthy i dont think hes ready to walk away said minaya adding that whether martinez returns to the mets in 2009 depends on what he shows down the stretch
4009496 im not planning to go away from the game if im healthy
4009497 im only 36 ill be 37 next year his birthday is oct 25 but one of the things im thinking about is my family i lost my dad how long will it be before you lose another one you love like your mom its difficult to think about somebody else
4009498 if you take part of this arm that i have you will go pretty far this arm pitched for a long time
4009499 for me hes accomplished the goals of what we wanted him to do minaya said
4009500 he gave us respectability in the marketplace he promoted the brand we dont get
4009501 il aimait ce sport c tait une philosophie de vie
4009502 comme vincent humbert ndlr t trapl gique de 22 ans que sa m re a aid mourir en 2003 je demande ce moment quon me permette de mourir pour me lib rer de mes souffrances
4009503 je sais quen france il ny a pas de loi qui permette aux quipes m dicales de pratiquer leuthanasie a memp che de vivre en paix il faut que la loi change le probl me est que vous monsieur nicolas sarkozy vous ne voulez pas en entendre parler moi r my salvat je vous demande de laisser de c t votre avis personnel et darr ter d tre sourd vous le pouvez si vous tes le pr sident de tous les fran ais
4009504 pour des raisons philosophiques personnelles je crois quil ne nous appartient pas que nous navons pas le droit dinterrompre volontairement la vie
4009505 mais je ne veux pas fuir mes responsabilit s je voudrais que soit privil gi le dialogue au chevet du malade entre lui m me le m decin et la famille en toute humanit afin que soit trouv e la solution la plus adapt e chaque situation
4009506 il suivait les affaires de droit au suicide assist comme laffaire chantal s bire cette femme atteinte dune tumeur incurable au visage qui a t retrouv e morte chez elle en mars il voulait que les lois changent il voulait avoir le droit de partir ces derniers mois il ne pouvait plus marcher son bras lui faisait aussi de plus en plus mal
4009507 que pour une maman cest quelque chose de tr s dur quune maman est l pour donner la vie pas pour la retirer
4009508 dans lenregistrement sonore de quelques minutes quil a laiss il nous demande de poursuivre son action pour quil y ait un vrai d bat public sur le droit leuthanasie et au suicide assist pour que dautres ne vivent pas cela
4009509 il est encore trop t t pour savoir comment nous allons poursuivre son action
4009510 il a longtemps eu peur de gagner c tait un gar on qui perdait ses moyens
4009511 on a bien discut quatre ou cinq reprises parfois fortement parfois plus calmement on a d y passer quatre cinq heures
4009512 il a du caract re il est extr mement t tu
4009513 mais si je lui explique pourquoi on fait les choses et dans quel cadre alors il adh re ce quon fait il faut quil soit partie prenante du projet cest quelquun de m thodique
4009514 she had an incredible commitment to humanitarian issues and was a wonderfully sensitive and dedicated person
4009515 they were travelling in white toyota landcruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles
4009516 their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation
4009517 that her life should come to such a brutal end while working to help others makes this an even greater tragedy this was a cowardly act that deserves widespread condemnation
4009518 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
4009519 i think there are new innovative ways to think of vacation
4009520 maybe you dont get to go to cancun but you can still take a break from your work
4009521 i knew that if i didnt take care of everything at home i would find more projects to get into and go back to work just as tired as when i left
4009522 there are some bikes that are not aerodynamic at all
4009523 and we put all our focus on aerodynamics that definitely helps me
4009524 i was really nervous for junior worlds which is weird for me
4009525 i was going in as the favorite if i didnt win id be a failure in everyones eyes i got that over with here im completely relaxed im having a good time
4009526 he sort of knows what the other guys are capable of and quite honestly they have no idea what hes capable of theyre more afraid of him than he is of them we still have not discovered what his limits are
4009527 weve gotten ourselves into a situation now where were a publicly listed company and bulking up via acquisitions is a strategy that makes sense
4009528 were acquiring business customers who are buying business grade data and voice communication services
4009529 the majority of nph customers are in sydney which is where we invested in a new network about 18 months ago
4009530 weve got blanket coverage for about 80 per cent of businesses in sydney
4009531 were just taking on the person that had key customer relations
4009532 businesses were looking to acquire are ones that have customers buying business data and voice services
4009533 the sweet spot is organisations that have between 1 million to 10 million turnover
4009534 he kind of chased me around the hors doeuvre table
4009535 i was trying to get something to eat and i thought this guys kind of weird i was kind of trying to get away from him
4009536 the falconry experience by the hotel hershey will acquaint participants with the history of mans relationship with raptors and the evolution of falconry it will include free flight demonstrations a simulated hunt demonstration and an opportunity for participants to hold a majestic bird of prey the program will be run by master falconer jack hubley

4009583 in den vier jahren meiner arbeit als interimsmanager hatte ich keine wiederholung
4009584 est un chanteur de rap fran ais ou plut t du slam il est n le 31 juillet 1977 en france il a maintenant 31 ans
4009585 wenn ein drittel der fr chte noch gr n ist gibt es das beste aroma
4009586 i dont pay attention to it ive been on waivers plenty of times
4009587 i dont know why it is a big deal that ive been put on waivers thats nothing new lots of great players are put on waivers but it is only a story when it is someone like manny ramirez or me someone that people have an opinion about
4009588 if they want to throw me over there thats fine with me
4009589 im comfortable over there obviously id have to take a couple of days of grounders during batting practice over there before i would feel 100 percent but i think for the most part id be all right
4009590 from the first one to the last one i was feeling sharper
4009591 i was trying to get my mechanics down in the first two and then the third one i was trying to locate some stuff the last outing the results were there because i was making good pitches attacking the zone
4009592 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4009593 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
4009594 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
4009595 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
4009596 according to a picture posted on flickr one lucky u s army soldier was saved by his ipod after the music player took a bullet from an ak 47 kevin garrad with the 3rd infantry division was patrolling the streets of iraq when he rounded a corner and went face to face with a gun toting insurgent
4009597 when youre out there its hard to tell sometimes whether youre stalling or not because your body is going through so many different things
4009598 ill look at it but the referees were unanimous on it so ill have to go with what they said
4009599 its very demanding physically youre getting thrown your bodys contorting all over the place you have to be in the best shape possible to be ready to have all your matches in one day
4009600 the best part of my life is being out on the mat nothing compares to it
4009601 i definitely dont regret coming back im the oldest guy to ever make the u s judo team that right there says a lot but i didnt come out of retirement just to make the team
4009602 if you get too confident it usually turns around and bites you
4009603 sometimes you have to get smarter when you get older and i wasnt as smart as i needed to be today
4009604 the weakening korean won continues to trigger additional air cargo demand from korean exporters
4009605 and theres always so many stories about how fighters became champions
4009606 we had always talked during the triple crown trail about wanting to end the season in the right way and thats in the breeders cup classic
4009607 of course you have memories of such a big tournament and losing
4009608 hes a good player so im very happy with this win because i think this was the first true test in this tournament
4009609 if hes too good for me hes too good for me
4009610 every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top
4009611 college is a whole different level its a lot harder than i expected it to be
4009612 i was star struck and it was my favorite college and i was from southern california and wanted to be close to home
4009613 but as things progressed i started to notice they had five star athletes at my position that hadnt played the year before
4009614 because i know thats why i was brought over here not to get the job done thats very frustrating for me
4009615 cried like a baby that sort of thing after that it was fine
4009616 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol what we need is to make sure that everyone whos participating understands it
4009617 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success
4009618 his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
4009619 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
4009620 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
4009621 we are the guys who when we land its completely bare
4009622 my sister is in the air force and she took me under her wing and said look this is what i think is best
4009623 shoot id been looking to do this for quite a while at least two years before getting out of the air force
4009624 my last year in the military i was like im going to go for it 100 percent and thats it i went for it 100 percent

4009627 he is really progressing as a football player after being away from the game you can definitely see improvement
4009628 there is a different football iq with him he is still playing some catch up but he is getting there he is an experienced guy in terms of his age being a lot older than the other guys in our meetings they might be ahead as far as football goes but he has them in life experiences

4009643 die glasbeschaffung ist derzeit ein sehr sehr gro es problem
4009644 viele winzer lassen keine gelegenheit aus um flaschen auf lager zu nehmen f r sp tere bestellungen
4009645 es sind ausw chse der glasknappheit dass man sich zu hause den hof voll stellt
4009646 wir haben das bislang haupts chlich aus umweltschutzgr nden gemacht
4009647 wenn es so weitergeht lohnt es sich bald auch wirtschaftlich
4009648 wir haben bereits anfang des jahres unseren jahresbedarf geordert in der vergangenheit war dies nicht n tig
4009649 wir bestellen und bezahlen schon im oktober um im fr hling abf llen zu k nnen
4009650 fordert man drei angebote an bekommt man dreimal den gleichen preis genannt da gibt es doch keinen richtigen markt mehr
4009651 die glasfabriken haben sich zusammengerottet und legen jetzt die preise fest
4009652 besonders bei spezialw nschen kann es sonst schwierig werden seine ware rechtzeitig zu bekommen
4009653 man will mit bestimmten flaschenformen aufmerksamkeit erzeugen und die tradition ein bisschen hochhalten

4009655 management is going to take the feedback they will get from these meetings back to the board of directors and decide on a strategic path shortly
4009656 all options are on the table within the constraints of the current credit environment
4009657 we have a lot of kids who started as beginners and it took them until their senior year to get to the top
4009658 everybodys going to be gunning for us and rightfully so
4009659 dear friend thank you for contacting me about gas prices
4009660 we need a president whos looking out for working families
4009661 ive proposed a real middle class tax cut that will give back 500 1 000 per family to 150 million workers and it will put this money in your pocket every year without hurting our roads
4009662 im running for president to challenge the broken system in washington and get things done with your support i will break through the barriers that have prevented progress for so long hot dang does that mean youre going to lay smack downs on pelosi and reid
4009663 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4009664 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
4009665 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the
4009666 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
4009667 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
4009668 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
4009669 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
4009670 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
4009671 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital

4009678 love this idea i have a wall that would be perfect for creating this look i just dont where you would find a vintage bank vault door like this and one that would not cost a small fortune
4009679 last year obviously things went the wrong way for me but i havent given up on myself
4009680 i made it to the nhl and have spent the last 20 years of my life dedicated to hockey i think that shows some commitment
4009681 obviously it doesnt top the relay from the other night but its something that is really close to me
4009682 the momentum was great but physically it took its toll im lucky i survived that day im feeling a little tired right now
4009683 there were four of us but i was the last one it was on my shoulders they said it wasnt my fault that its a four man race that helped me
4009684 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
4009685 its tough but we got the american record by four seconds so we cant really complain

4009688 you will be aware of the ongoing national debate on offensive weapons including knives
4009689 it would not be right to talk about these things
4009690 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
4009691 were going to be able to play tired out there
4009692 i knew with the senior corners leaving last year id have to step up and take a leadership role
4009693 throw an incident and an injury or two and it watch video of csu football scrimmage and interview with coach steve fairchild visit natalie meislers all things rams blog for a behind the scenes look at csu sports gets even thinner we understand injuries are part of the game there will never be an excuse
4009694 we just help each other out no position is set in stone and we want to put pressure on each other to do better
4009695 i played at fort hays in kansas but i couldnt be there for four years of my life so i moved back here
4009696 eat isnt that funny next thing you know i am going to be doing the same thing to remind myself to go to the restroom
4009697 this is incredible i usually have to wait up to two weeks to get everything i needed
4009698 ok ill do this for a year and get everything paid for and squared away and just look for something else of which would allow me to perform
4009699 hey do you realize that they hired me knowing i was making a huge move from tampa that i just invested 15 thousand dollars on the move
4009700 who is the last person in the world you thought would move to nyc
4009701 well that s funny they just told me they really liked you and they wanted to make sure you were interested before they sent the paperwork to japan
4009702 where things have gone wrong they should be used as a learning point to avoid this happening again in the future
4009703 she is an old lady who was very hard working throughout her life she is a very intelligent woman who has a degree and she is being treated like this when i showed my mother the note she just wanted to go home
4009704 i was pretty horrified especially when i saw the details on it
4009705 i think it is appalling because the hospital is in a position of trust it is not right obviously medical staff need to know this information but it should not be left out on a ward for all to see
4009706 the hospital takes patient data confidentiality extremely seriously and we are dealing with this issue as a matter of priority
4009707 an internal investigation into the allegations was launched immediately and led by a senior investigating officer is now underway each of the issues is being looked into in turn and in depth
4009708 the list included data that is essential for both good and safe patient care and related to 16 patients we are immediately reviewing how we make sure that information central to good patient care is also further protected again wed like to reassure the public that their confidentiality is given the utmost importance this is a highly regrettable but very rare occurrence
4009709 we do not use the word bed block every patient matters and if somebody is delayed then they are delayed for a reason there was never an issue that this lady was a bed blocker we will look at this very carefully but we do not recognise the practice of leaving notes like this
4009710 great care needs to be taken with patient records and if there has been a breach of security they should review the procedures which led to it suffolk homes

4009712 he got shaken up when he heard the police were after him
4009713 i took them down to the diamond district in manhattan on 47th street and sold them
4009714 it would be fair to say you lied to protect him and your sister
4009715 of course shes a woman and many guys are good at that
4009716 their goal will be to introduce a third party culpability argument with the sole intention of implanting in the jurys mind that mr liebman might be the perpetrator of the burglaries
4009717 i knew that he was the fellow she would cheat on when she was with me or with alan
4009718 they harassed me and everyone who knew me or came into contact with me
4009719 they were all committed during hours of decreased visibility which gave him a distinct advantage in being able to tell pretty much where people were in the house
4009720 everybody has their right to have a primary but they should consider the costs and if they really statistically have a chance to win
4009721 i think many voters will sign a petition for a candidate but it doesnt necessarily mean they will vote for them
4009722 i very strongly believe in ballot access and i think most people agree with that principle
4009723 lee whitnum did what the law required it is unfortunate that turnout was low in some areas we can always change the signature requirement if there is a strong sentiment that the threshold isnt appropriate
4009724 i think its been a learning experience for lee whitnum
4009725 look im not going to try to second guess the laws of the state of connecticut you should take that up with somebody else
4009726 there are a ton of parents who expect these supplies for their kids and pre ordered them
4009727 we want to put a positive spin on this so were looking at it with the theme glenvilles semester abroad
4009728 this isnt what we planned but were rolling with the punches
4009729 some of the kids are excited honestly as long as they can be with their friends theyre happy
4009730 the real measure of character is how you respond to adversity and these parents understand that
4009731 i love the concept of cleaning up greenwich and making it better for other people
4009732 they usually give us jobs that the town is too busy to do
4009733 this program is a great opportunity to get involved and meet new people
4009734 we were just trying to do the same thing just trying to row fast and clean bumping it up a little bit focusing each bit down the race course
4009735 because were pretty new at this we were happy to just get our nose in it and be there with the other guys down the course
4009736 before we knew it we had 250 meters left and we went for it because we could smell the finish line that put us into the final and were pretty happy with that
4009737 we didnt position ourselves with much expectation coming into this regatta
4009738 the first heat saturday was our first racing piece ever in an international regatta this was our third
4009739 we came in with not a lot of expectations and weve been trying to use that to our advantage
4009740 they had a person come in and calmly tell us a suspicious package had been found and that we must leave the building
4009741 everybody was nervous youve never been asked to leave a building before like this
4009742 all three of those guys are special theyre special people special talents youve got to play your best people thats what were going to do
4009743 ive always enjoyed competition ive always been that way whether the competition is better than me or not its going to make me better im not going to shy away from that that would only hurt me
4009744 since im a little guy a lot of teams didnt really look at me
4009745 hes strong and hes very competitive i think the other guys back there are feeding off him
4009746 hey darwinism led to social darwinism which was evil but because of the name thats what all athiestic scientists believe
4009747 well im an atheist and im more ethical than most religious people i know
4009748 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events

4009753 we call upon the greek government in the name of historic justice and human rights as universal value to face the unsustainable policy of the past we want to be able to return to our homeland and we want abolition of the discriminatory laws which deny our rights
4009754 the nuremberg principles adopted in 1946 which are now legislation in more than 80 countries
4009755 are not concerned with the ethnicity or the origin of the refugees if their property was seized it is not important if they were listed as bulgarian or even if they were or were not greek citizens
4009756 macedonia becomes the home state of the refugees to give citizenship to those who do not have it and to become their legal protector
4009757 they entered the war deceived by promises of macedonian unification made by the yugoslav leadership which also had its eyes on trieste and istria
4009758 even if you are right you dont think people would even consider changing their commutes
4009759 just look at geology rd off of broad river rd if that were connected to piney grove and then across the river straight to monticello rd then youd have access to a whole new route into downtown
4009760 even if you are right you dont think people would even consider changing their commutes
4009761 it means the virus is intensifying in the community and the risk of illness is increasing
4009762 no george italy was the speed bump dublin was the brick wall

4009764 art is something that lies in the slender margin between the real and the unreal
4009765 im on my way to becoming an er trauma nurse im becoming an empowered and determined advocate for myself and my son
4009766 i feel pride to represent the united states i felt enormous pride last year winning two golds for the united states at worlds i wanted to make the best out of my running career to be a role model for young athletes
4009767 said lagat who radiates a wide eyed innocence despite his age
4009768 its no longer that i look at what el guerrouj did in 2004 it is what lagat did in 2007 i am trying to compete with myself and that gives me more confidence
4009769 i stay home my wife stays home with me and my son theres no time daddys not around the only time im not around is when i go for training when i take my son to the playground nobody knows who i am and i like that
4009770 the kids who recycle are generating income for the school by implementing this program
4009771 were teaching the youth in the community to recycle and how important it is
4009772 next is the central african republic a republic in central africa
4009773 here comes vietnam they dont have a chance at a medal in these games but they are gold medalists in the math olympics
4009774 the boobs on bikes parade is a commercial stunt advertising an r 18 event with sexualised nudity in a public street that is offensive to many people and completely inappropriate for young people and children to view
4009775 if this really happens in the real world women on the pill would end up choosing a more genetically similar mate than she would otherwise choose and the implications go on from there
4009776 my own research says the way a man smells to a woman is the main determinant of sexual attraction
4009777 if you cant stand how someone smells you cannot become intimate
4009778 a womans response to a mans natural body odor will be colored by her feelings for him
4009779 so if you fell in love with a man online it would be hard to be repelled by his smell
4009780 how is it possible for an indian to guard his land from fellow indian
4009781 with violence escalating the troubled state of jammu and kashmir is again at the brink of catastrophe
4009782 to end this cycle of tragedy the government should order security forces to act with restraint and all parties should try to settle the dispute peacefully
4009783 thank you now im going home to my dark bedroom and wait for the voices
4009784 to end this cycle of tragedy the government should order security forces to act with restraint and all parties should try to settle the dispute peacefully
4009785 both national and state elections due in a few months political parties and separatist groups are inciting the violence and using the dispute to fuel their own political agendas
4009786 with violence escalating the troubled state of jammu and kashmir is again at the brink of catastrophe

4009789 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4009790 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4009791 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4009792 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4009793 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4009794 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4009795 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4009796 the amount of time it takes to build the software and run all of the tests
4009797 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4009798 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4009799 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4009800 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4009801 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4009802 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4009803 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4009804 way too fast its a new generation and its now time to step aside
4009805 they did a great job im from the previous generation with alex popov
4009806 ive raced many times against alain but i didnt know he was in my league we met before the races and hes a great guy and we have a good relationship im very happy with an ambassador like alain hes a great sportsman
4009807 its been a very long time my fourth olympics my fourth final in the 100 freestyle
4009808 the olympics is very special to me when i was 10 years old watching seoul watching matt biondi i got really inspired
4009809 i thought maybe it was possible to make history and win three times in a row but in 2005 i got really set back and started from zero
4009810 after eight long years and swimming three times in a row 47 seconds this is under my best i did in sydney its a big achievement for me personally im realizing it now because a few minutes ago i was very very disappointed because i was close to the bronze its weird but i was only thinking about ways to win the race and that was impossible with guys like eamon and bernard
4009811 im going to take my rest now i deserve my rest
4009812 if everything goes well someone could run a pretty good time
4009813 a lot of people are saying that you know that usain and tyson are very strong finishers
4009814 but you know if i get out there in front of them then no matter how hard they are finishing they wont even close on me
4009815 asafa powell is a strong runner usain bolt came up on the scene and lit up track theres people whove done a lot of things no ones ever seen before
4009816 the 100 used to be in the 9 9 high and 10 low thats what makes it so amazing to know you have three guys who can run 9 7 it shows that anythings possible
4009817 its an inconvenience theyre happy to do it just to keep the sport clean but it can become a hassle
4009818 wed love this olympics to be about something other than doping control
4009819 can make it the best field ever and it can certainly be the best race ever
4009820 i didnt relax and run straight through the finish line
4009821 if i go here and think like im supposed to ill be the winner
4009822 the issue is not how fast you can run but how many times can you do that how many times can you reproduce that performance

4009826 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now
4009827 its dangerous if youre getting advice from people who are very close to countries on one side or another of a conflict
4009828 mccain adviser got paid by georgia while encouraging mccain to support country
4009829 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
4009830 obviously meant a lot to saakashvili personally but more importantly the message it conveyed to the georgian people in this really time of unprecedented national emergency
4009831 we should realize what is at stake here for americans
4009832 what americans should do know first of all clearly make known their intentions
4009833 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
4009834 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4009835 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4009836 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
4009837 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
4009838 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
4009839 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies
4009840 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
4009841 as you know through the nato membership if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
4009842 i do not see any obtainable objectives in lebanon and the longer we stay there the harder it will be to leave
4009843 if you get involved in a major ground war in the saudi desert i think support will erode significantly
4009844 nor should it be supported we cannot even contemplate in my view trading american blood for iraqi blood
4009845 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4009846 if indeed russia is violating a cease fire and i have to say the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the cease fire that will only serve to deepen the isolation to which russia is moving
4009847 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
4009848 the road is likely to remain closed for a considerable period of time
4009849 this is a welcome addition to animal therapies because dog obesity appears to be increasing
4009850 veterinarians are well aware that overweight pets are at a higher risk of developing various health problems from cardiovascular conditions to diabetes to joint problems

4009932 i had a great time at lunch today it was called lunch 2 0 we played networking games like meet someone you dont know i met some new friends and networked with some old ones we shared some job related war stories and tall tales
4009933 the importance of the book lies firstly in the fact that the various kinds of ethical relativism are clearly distinguished and secondly the new authors singled out for special discussion harman and wong present the most up to date and plausible versions of relativism a skillfull analysis of the types of ethical relativism and a critique of the best version is clearly something to be warmly welcomed

4009940 were clearly not as cohesive as we used to be and the trust level isnt as high as it used to be
4009941 but we still do the business of the city we still meet every tuesday
4009942 we cant let our council meetings become so political that our staff cant do their job
4009943 now they dont know what they can bring to us
4009944 she seems to be raising weekly objections to various spending items
4009945 i get frustrated that no one seems to be taking this budget situation seriously
4009946 this is a mayoral election year so everything is going to be questioned by people on the council who have their reasons for saying what they say
4009947 if this had come to us in february we wouldnt have had to have a long discussion
4009948 i want to thank lauren for reminding me that this is a political time
4009949 now weve got boxes in offices piling up that need to be archived
4009950 our people bring in an average 1 000 to 2 000 per hour for the state when theyre out auditing
4009951 but now they have to sit down and write memos and fill out forms that explain why their travel is an emergency under the governors order
4009952 our pay and working conditions are not a priority for our governor or the general public
4009953 everything just tightens up its just one more pound added to the load that people are already carrying
4009954 hes forcing them to finally admit that the california correctional system is in desperate need of reform from top to bottom
4009955 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs
4009956 but the states leaders have failed to act therefore it is with great reluctance and yet a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the federal courts intervention to secure this funding
4009957 will continue to work cooperatively with the receiver in a fiscally responsible way to provide the necessary funding
4009958 unless there is a legislatively approved appropriation or a court order compelling payment
4009959 our issue is very simple we just believe the receivers plan is a partial solution to the whole problem
4009960 the receiver warned the legislature he would do what he needs to do to make sure the united states constitution is complied with
4009961 his actions today were exactly consistent with the comments he made and thats why he went into a court of law
4009962 raises the very real immediate prospect that our construction program will fail
4009963 i indicated to the legislature i did not want to be drawn into the budget vortex where late night deals are made without public consideration and without thoughtful consideration
4009964 these olympics have become a significant cultural event that this country is sharing
4009965 and you almost never get that in these days of fractionalized media
4009966 in the past the only way you had to do the olympics was to sit and watch it on tv or maybe you had people over to watch it together
4009967 now people can interact with each other all around the world through blogs through twitter a free social networking and micro blogging service and theyre making it a live remote event media is no longer a one way communication
4009968 its convergence and theyre creating an audience for each other
4009969 giving people more ways to participate online brings more viewers and keeps viewers more engaged so theyre less likely to miss an episode and more likely to talk about it with friends
4009970 its the same reason people watch the world cup because it happens every four years
4009971 and when people ask where were you when michael phelps won his eighth gold medal and crushed mark spitzs record
4009972 the tv ratings alone suggest this is an absolute banner year for the olympics on tv
4009973 i dont see the internet replacing it what were seeing is an augmentation
4009974 swimming is such a short event you can relive it on the web
4009975 were living with four dollar gas high food prices and families unable to afford summer vacations
4009976 americans need something to cheer for and this olympics and this u s team is filling that need
4009977 we were surprised by how many people were interested in what happened to us
4009978 i yelled to my mother and she picked him up and held him
4009979 when she heard that he was ok she burst out crying
4009980 we wanted her to know that there were people who cared about her
4009981 what do you say to someone who saved your life
4009982 thank you seems so small she deserves so much more than that
4009983 all my life i had hoped to meet a birth relative
4009984 and now a sister i couldnt ask for anything more
4009985 were huddling now and trying to see what our next step will be
4009986 the question continues to be are there republican votes for it
4009987 i think we keep getting closer but there are still issues to work out
4009988 we hope that the legislators have the same sense of urgency that we do we need to get this done
4009989 were continuing to negotiate on all the pieces of the puzzle
4009990 until they all come together its premature to say whats in and whats out
4009991 itd be a phony cap if anything and ive seen it all its all for a rainy day fund which is a good start but its not a hard spending cap that would solve the problem you can characterize it any way you want but it is what it is
4009992 strengthening our rainy day fund operates as a spending cap because the state would be setting aside money that otherwise could be spent
4009993 i helped staff understand how to be responsive and provide information in a timely way
4009994 i work for a bank and we wouldnt go outside for something like that when people are on staff who could handle it
4009995 we are all totally devastated and cannot imagine life without paul
4009996 we ask that is anybody knows anything about what happened no matter how insignificant it might seem to please come forward

4009998 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
