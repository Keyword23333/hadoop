7630003 our business users are using safari to deliver jasperreports to them on their iphone while the effort to write the 100 lines of java code to build an iphone app is minimal its just not needed
7630004 it allows iphone users to access salesforce crm applications and more than 70 000 force com custom applications right from their iphone
7630005 from a historic standpoint the mobile revolution began in the 90s with the mass adoption of mobile phones as a primary means of communication soon mobile e mail became a way of life in the enterprise as consumers and professionals became more familiar with mobile devices and as mobile devices became more like mobile laptops end users increasingly desired and expected to be able to do everything from the mobile devices that they could do from their desks
7630006 its not meant to replace a dashboard and analytical apps that have a whole bunch of drilldowns but rather to give you handy access to core sets of metrics we wanted to make usage and availability ubiquitous and let users tailor the information to exactly what they want to see
7630007 since we support the iphones alerting mechanisms you dont have to go hunting for information youll get alerted when data crosses a threshold that you or someone else has set
7630008 the cool thing is that youre actually developing in cocoa and the mac os environment so in terms of the development environment its very mature and complete
7630009 thanks to the iphones robust development environment we were able to develop test and deliver salesforce mobile for the iphone all in less than three months
7630010 salesforce com and apple will continue to work closely to iterate and expand the breadth of functionality of salesforce mobile for the iphone to expand the ways that enterprises can use salesforce crm and force com applications to improve the way they work

7630069 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7630070 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties up to now we have 27 confirmed dead and 75 wounded
7630071 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7630072 we called off regular patrols in kalma because it is not part of our mandate to search for arms and arrest individuals
7630073 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7630074 a unamid police and military force accessed the camp and we are prepared for possible assistance in the case of evacuating any type of casualties
7630075 i am asking you to those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me during the primary
7630076 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumour of controversy than the fact of unity
7630077 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so

7630089 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues

7630098 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7630099 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7630100 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7630101 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7630102 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7630103 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and we cannot grant full immunity
7630104 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament

7630163 with the new discoveries in jasmonate signaling we have the opportunity to make rapid progress in understanding the mechanism of action of this essential defense hormone
7630164 the research carried out by the young scientists supported by the martin distinguished professorship will contribute to this new frontier in plant biology

7630166 he was appointed as the martin distinguished professor because he has both the scientific and teaching ability to make a profound impact in agricultural research hes already made critical contributions to our understanding of the biology of plant defense systems this professorship will enable him to both expand his research and his capacity to train graduate students

7630200 my life has changed it is the most beautiful title you can win in swimming
7630201 but now im going to meet some friends and have a few lie ins
7630202 the running game i think thats another area that we have to improve
7630203 there were some runs that i was really pleased with and then some other runs that we didnt quite get what we wanted
7630204 whenever you cant run the ball the line isnt doing its part
7630205 we have to get better as a front five and make more room for the backs you make your landmarks and get your guys blocked up better to make the holes a little clearer for the backs
7630206 i should be pressing the holes a lot longer than ive been doing lately
7630207 im making the cutbacks too soon and im not even a cutback runner its a matter of us not being disciplined enough
7630208 we can better our courses in approaching the line and better our reads its a collective thing
7630209 in the passing game i can miss a block and the quarterback can still get the ball off
7630210 in the running game you have to have all 11 guys doing everything right on a particular play for the runner to go far getting everybody sync ed up often takes time
7630211 rumors are swirling regarding just about every aspect of the companys future
7630212 barack obama has chosen one of the most rabid pro music and film industry senators joe biden in the business to be his running mate in the forthcoming presidential elections
7630213 i have to admit that you do sloth like nobodys business
7630214 i just sic them on punks like that like a couple of pitbulls
7630215 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7630216 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7630217 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7630218 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7630219 well have no shortage of energy and enthusiasm in that stadium thursday night
7630220 i dont think anybodys going to stop him unless hes convicted
7630221 this support is going on all over the state i think if anything im energized
7630222 shame on all of us for not helping with the project
7630223 after all he has done for us every man woman and child should have chipped in to build our greatest alaskan ever a home the size of the
7630224 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7630225 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7630226 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7630227 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7630228 we thought the kick was going to go more to the left and we would veer to the right where i would have time to come around
7630229 but they kicked it to the right that made it tight so i had to improvise i had to turn around earlier
7630230 basically all i had to do was catch the ball first of all and just see the lanes and run
7630231 i want to be a receiver first and foremost but i can do other things to help the team win ballgames and im going to do it if im called to do that
7630232 i beat a fullback and then they put adrian peterson out there to hold me up
7630233 after weve looked at it in detail we have a lot of improvement to make
7630234 were better than that its as simple as that theres no need for panic or anything like that but thats not acceptable and well play better defense in the future
7630235 top russian general suggested that the presence of u s and other nato ships in the black sea would worsen tensions already at a post cold war low

7630242 ik heb geprobeerd om haar gevoelens en haar emoties en alles wat ze mij daarover vertelde over te brengen in je naam in de sterren
7630243 ik weet nog hoe yolanthe op een avond zei zag je dat

7630247 first peoples awareness of the environment will increase second chinese people understand its okay to be proud to be chinese
7630248 i think there is a new kind of satire thats coming out it isnt necessarily targeted at individuals but rather at the system which people seem rather tired of
7630249 its almost like the politicians are second guessing the jokes that the comedians are going to do
7630250 i think were going to see a lot of that satire on the fringe next year
7630251 the angolan governments response to allegations of corruption a combination of candor denials and evasion is not always helpful and increases the skepticism with which many view angolas current efforts
7630252 opposition parties and viewpoints do not have the same access to media as the ruling party does
7630253 it is a taxpayer it carries out quasi fiscal activities it invests public funds and as concessionaire it is a sector regulator this multifarious work program creates conflicts of interest and characterizes a complex relationship between sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual fiscal stance of the state
7630254 it is a de facto arm of the government but it also competes with the government
7630255 angola is in the rehabilitation phase this is before the development phase
7630256 government ministries were returning up to 40 percent of their budgets to the treasury during the last fiscal year because projects couldnt be implemented
7630257 although the government is making efforts to train people it would be unrealistic to think that they train people as quickly as they build infrastructure
7630258 their economy is made so expensive because of the oil sector
7630259 unlike projects undertaken by the ministry of finance it is unclear how much money is directly managed by the grn how funds are allocated among projects and how much money so far has been spent
7630260 fantastic they all think things are starting to work because of the chinese
7630261 the government will need to focus more attention on planning and organization to ensure the sustainability and transfer of know how or risk relying on the portgueuse and others returning in the near future to rebuild what the chinese have just completed
7630262 the greatest deficiency in the country is institutional and human capital
7630263 patience and forebearance rebuilding a country after so much destruction and creating a more equitable society in which angolas leaders are politically accountable will not be achieved quickly

7630278 this convention provides a very important opportunity for the obama campaign to bond with the constituencies that supported hillary clinton its not about barack or hillary its about bringing in the people here who voted for hillary rodham clinton senator obama and senator biden are without question qualified to do that

7630333 mccain is doing much better in several areas than a lot of people expected and thats obviously good for us
7630334 there seems to be a reluctance on the part of a lot of voters to back obama and thats benefiting mccain and our legislative candidates as well
7630335 i think most new york democrats are concerned about obamas slippage

7630341 that was meant to be i mean its very unfortunate for him and for the giants but it wasnt like guys rolled up on him that probably wouldve happened in practice at some point the way it occurred he just went down injuries are part of it they come in a lot of different ways
7630342 ive played so many games and not that i havent been injured but ive overcome injuries been lucky in a lot of situations he said
7630343 this is 18 years whatevers going to happen is going to happen i cant control that i love to play and thats really all i can think about
7630344 im going to see what it looks like over the two days and then evaluate it i cant say definitively no or definitively yes
7630345 i do understand his side of it i really do he has the whole team to think of
7630346 well i guess no more of a concern than coming in later and having a week to prepare for my first game like i did two weeks ago he said of his debut against washington
7630347 to me that was a real game based on the circumstances at least in this case i will have had some practice and have worked with these guys not that that makes it any better but i feel more comfortable in that situation now than i did several weeks ago
7630348 after the game i felt ok the 38 year old favre said
7630349 yesterday morning i woke up and i said ok not too bad

7630362 please know that ive thought of your son every day and will every day of my life
7630363 hes always been one to rise to the occasion but this was about more than that
7630364 this was his way to maybe help quell a mini revolt among the delegates he likes barack obama and hes worried about the clinton factor hes now going to be the story of this convention at least until obama gives his acceptance speech and this should completely silence whatever dissension exists
7630365 may have accomplished more in the senate than some presidents did in the white house
7630366 i think this is his final hurrah to the party his final gift to the party
7630367 hes the last link to that promising new frontier generation of the 1960s when the world seemed pliable when we were going to make the world a better place when we were going to battle poverty and racism and fight for peace

7630386 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7630387 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7630388 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7630389 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate

7630447 it has been a long pull all of us wish it would be shorter
7630448 when compared to traditional pcs thin clients consume less power are easier to manage and require less maintenance
7630449 when all these benefits are coupled with the fact that thin clients can help a company reduce its ecological footprint its clear why thin clients are experiencing staggering growth
7630450 many business leaders believe environmentally friendly alternatives will compromise productivity
7630451 however new white paper dismisses this belief by detailing how thin client computing can provide companies with a green it solution while contributing to their bottom line

7630466 your television ads keep saying things that are not true and you have refused to accept my proposals to have a debate
7630467 we need to stand in public and be truthful this is a public building its paid for by taxpayers money and so there is no reason no reason at all that you cannot agree now to a debate
7630468 when we can arrange our schedule we will meet for a debate
7630469 i have a job to do were not going to do it on your demands we have said publicly when we can arrange our schedule we will meet were not going to do it on your demands not here or there ok i expect the invitations soon
7630470 we have both received invitations but kuhl has not responded
7630471 some people want to be disrespectful and want to be interuptive for their own political gain
7630472 this event was not campaign related and it was shamefully and frankly sad that massa tried to turn the attention away from our first responders and back to himself
7630473 and the time for action is now the energy issue is the most critical our country has economically i hope changes will come before the end of the year
7630474 i understand you are trying to make this a political issue but youre not going to
7630475 he said this wasnt a political event today but his only staffer there was his campaign manager
7630476 kuhl has stopped his town hall meetings wont take questions from the public and refuses to respond to invitations to debate the issues of the day
7630477 we have decided to quit the coalition and sit on the opposition benches in parliament
7630478 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7630479 the ppp also violated the latest agreement reached earlier this month that the judges will be restored 24 hours after the resignation of musharraf

7630496 someone whos willing to stand up and thank the american people for their sacrifice in liberating iraq
7630497 had been favorably impressed with his open thanks to the coalition
7630498 in fact its not really even possible to say whether such a thing is
7630499 this is the most luminous and therefore probably the most massive cluster of galaxies discovered at this epoch
7630500 the light we observe started about 7 7 billion years ago this is about half of the age of the universe so it is from quite long ago and quite far away
7630501 the existence of the cluster can only be explained with dark energy
7630502 the fact that we do find these clusters is a clear confirmation of dark energy
7630503 this was a very long time ago and its actually about as massive as the most massive ones we observe today without dark energy we would observe much more massive clusters and many more of these massive clusters than we actually do
7630504 we have a chance to get peyton activated and out to practice so well see how that goes
7630505 i think well ease him in and see how he practices and what hes able to do

7630511 its interesting that somehow the original post was seen as criticism of linux whereas it targeted the mozilla foundation kernel space udev rules but whose
7630512 udev is now a key component in almost all linux systems its like the plumbing in a house most people never notice it until it can the dog start wagging the tail
7630513 the second and probably most important thing it has shown is that ms can and will give in to price pressure and is not nearly as the hacker test more linux and unix humor

7630518 estamos muy felices nosotros hoy por la incorporaci n de honduras al alba la alternativa bolivariana una alternativa a la hegemon a imperial y del mundo capitalista
7630519 es un espacio de integraci n de gobiernos progresistas de gobiernos que plantean un camino distinto a todos los pueblos de centro am rica y de nuestra am rica
7630520 detr s de toda esa campa a est n los pitiyanquis que son arrastrados buena parte de los medios de comunicaci n est n en manos de pitiyanquis que se arrastran ante los yanquis le lamen la mano al yanqui
7630521 buena parte de los medios de comunicaci n hacen toda esa campa a de agresi n en contra del alba
7630522 parte de la jugada del imperio de los estados unidos para tratar de frenar lo que no se puede frenar porque esta revoluci n es de toda am rica latina
7630523 el reto es sobrevivir al gobierno que desprecia a los m dicos
7630524 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7630525 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7630526 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
7630527 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
7630528 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won
7630529 stands for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
7630530 every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
7630531 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
7630532 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
7630533 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
7630534 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7630535 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7630536 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7630537 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7630538 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7630539 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
7630540 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
7630541 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
7630542 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state
7630543 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
7630544 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
7630545 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
7630546 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7630547 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7630548 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7630549 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7630550 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7630551 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia
7630552 the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
7630553 any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
7630554 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
7630555 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
7630556 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7630557 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7630558 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7630559 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7630560 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7630561 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7630562 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7630563 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7630564 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7630565 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7630566 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7630567 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks
7630568 to deter looters and the transportation of arms and ammunition
7630569 the eurasian corridor pipeline geopolitics and the new cold war
7630570 intimately related to the control over energy pipeline and transportation corridors and cites evidence that the georgian august 7 attack was carefully planned in high level consultations between us and nato officials
7630571 coordinat ion with natos plans to strengthen its black sea naval presence
7630572 silk road strategy the trans eurasian security system as an essential building block of post cold war us foreign policy
7630573 an energy and transport corridor network linking western europe to central asia and eventually to the far east
7630574 effective cooperation in politics trade and economy science and technology
7630575 we stand at the brink of a second nuclear age not since hiroshima and nagasaki has the world faced such perilous choices
7630576 power and with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur
7630577 so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that its a bilateral agreement that would provide the authorities for our troops to operate in iraq
7630578 arguments can be made to justify any time of detention just as in other countries although mercifully not here they can be made to justify any method of interrogation
7630579 how come we got more law enforcement than we got prisoners
7630580 i didnt give them any information at all so i guess not guilty
7630581 giving popular schools the freedom to expand does not mean they will do so to the extent that a schools position in the league tables depends on the attainment of its intake schools may be unwilling to increase and potentially to dilute the quality of their student body
7630582 everyone knows that there is a strong association between social class and achievement and that this association works very much to the disadvantage of economically disadvantaged students
7630583 the california research however had the virtue of demonstrating that this disadvantage was exaggerated as school size increased

7630586 letters will move around times building telling of events in all parts of the world
7630587 cab drivers would pull over to the curb doors agape with their radios on full blast allowing the nearby crowds to listen to the presidents inspiring words while simultaneously reading the electronic times headlines of his speech zipping past it was an effect in sensory surround
7630588 the effectiveness of the zipper is its simplicity and immediacy
7630589 its now a common technology and you can take a message output it through a computer and within seconds have it on the front of a building for allthe world to see
7630590 their sign system had become a living representation of what the company is all about
7630591 we now have a sculptural led display board that conforms to the building and is constantly changing its look from minute to minute
7630592 the center of the tssl sign incorporated a sony jumbotron video display which fitted into an even larger multimedia built video screen composed of seven separate full color reader board ribbons that wrap around the front of the good morning america studios building
7630593 the metaphor for the vertical part of the reuters sign
7630594 is an antenna all this news is in the air and the sign is just pulling it in together the eleven signs are synchronized to create the effect of a single surface a window into the world of reuters and the instinet
7630595 that at least 90 of sales are directed to the message center reader boards the major customers for these boards are banks retail businesses churches and schools the latter two using them as public service announcement displays
7630596 is to differentiate between indirect marketing newspapers television and radio and direct contact with their customers and electronic readers have become the perfect medium to do that
7630597 letters will move around times building telling of events in all parts of the world
7630598 sign system that had become a living representation of what the company is all about
7630599 packed with armed men wearing police and security forces uniforms hit us with
7630600 they were surprised by heavy gunfire from within the camp there was an exchange of fire and a number of victims
7630601 if government forces carry out more attacks against our people the sla is ready to confront and retaliate
7630602 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection
7630603 we continue at this point to believe that this was a legitimate strike against the taliban
7630604 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
7630605 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7630606 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7630607 no in the warehouse fire a couple of years ago i was in one of the adjoining houses which also burnt down the dragon in question got me out my mother and my little brother he also got five other people out from other houses still going in on foot when his wings were burnt too badly for him to fly
7630608 then i discovered that someone was trying to prevent dragons becoming members of the rescue teams in spite of their increased speed and access to places men with ladders could never reach it took me a long time searching through records normally those proposing new laws stand up and argue for them but here it was being slid in surreptitiously hidden behind other regulations had i not been a legal clerk in the layout department id probably never have seen it had i not been rescued wouldnt have recognised it
7630609 and when i had discovered who you were i investigated further and found the other laws you were introducing without fanfare the laws to make it impossible to employ a dragon if there was a human being looking for a job anywhere even if that human might be incapable of filling the post even if no human could do the job at all laws to make sure that any dragon finishing his military service would have only one choice to re enlist or leave the empire look

7630622 the american dental association which for so long has promoted the use of mercury amalgams has recently divested itself of any culpability with regard to mercury
7630623 now an obvious question arises if mercury were safe as the dental profession has insisted for years why would the american dental association feel obligated to claim nobody can hold it responsible for the harm it has caused
7630624 one of the problems with metals is their environmental persistence once mined and brought into the ecology they last almost indefinitely also we face the usually ignored problem of
7630625 mercury is found in the environment in three basic states elemental mercury or mercury vapor inorganic mercury and organic mercury ethyl methyl alkyl or phenylmercury each form has an individual toxicological profile and metabolic fate the most frequent source of mercury exposure is open to debate
7630626 the real point is this mercury is toxic and that statement is now beyond debate
7630627 that 70 of all medical illnesses are directly or indirectly caused by human intervention in the dental structures teeth and jawbones
7630628 according to the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr of the u s department of health and human services mercury is listed as the third most frequently found lead and arsenic are first and second and the most toxic substance in the united states
7630629 at michael biamontes health clinic testing the mercury levels in his patients with various illnesses michael found that 84 of his patients with candida had elevated mercury levels and that they were 60 higher than normal the exact same numbers held for patients with parasites 86 of patients with epstein barr virus had mercury levels elevated by 68 for those with chemical sensitivities 85 were 70 elevated and with chronic urinary tract infections 82 were 68 elevated most other conditions were much lower
7630630 candida is often related to at least two other hidden modern epidemics mercury poisoning and parasites the majority of people who have mercury silver amalgams fillings dont succumb to chronic mercury poisoning although they may have symptoms and dismiss them if their immune systems are strong when a persons immune system has been weakened they cannot eliminate mercury from the body and so develop severely mercury poisoning candida is present in everyones bodies and its necessary to maintain balance in the digestive system but one of its functions is to fight mercury so when too mercury is present candida grows out of control
7630631 longer term chronic adrenal fatigue is often the result of continued sever physical emotional or spiritual demand being made on the individual multiple sever attacks against the immune system may begin with a specific factor which applies a generalized influence such as heavy metals a continuing or acute exposure to pesticides fungicides herbicide or other very toxic substances will increasingly distract and disable the immune system
7630632 metals can directly and indirectly damage dna and that means an increased risk of cancer we call this genotoxicity
7630633 it also explains why so many cancers come back over and over again
7630634 insulin has three sulfur containing cross linkages and the insulin receptor has a tyrosine kinase containing sulfur bond which are the preferred targets for binding by both mercury and lead should mercury attach to one of these three sulfur bonds it will interfere with the normal biological function of the insulin molecule it is reasonable to assume a direct correlation between rising environmental mercury levels mercury exposure through dental amalgam heavy fish consumption and exposure to mercury in vaccines with the rapidly expanding diabetic pandemic not to mention the host of drugs and even chemicals put into foods that are part of the diabetic equation the medical establishment is dragging its collective ass when it comes to understanding the causes of diabetes and thus is remaining impotent in the face of a steadily worsening human catastrophe it is perfectly clear though to health officials that the diabetic epidemic is expanding rapidly but because they scratch their heads about chemical causes they remain incapable of arresting the pandemic
7630635 many proteins need to have phosphorus derivatives attached to them and mercury will get in the way of this
7630636 joints and the outer coats of nerves insulation are largely made up of connective tissue called collagen two collagen molecules are hooked together by two sulfur atoms one from each molecule the sulfut from one collagen holds the hand of the sulfru from another collagen forming a cross link mercury has a great affinity for two sulfur atoms at a time because it often has an electrical need for two this means it can easily get in between the two sulfur atoms holding each of their hands
7630637 disruption in the balance of calcium not good news when you consider how often we hear of people being diagnosed with osteoporosis another point in this area is that the liver and the kidney are two major organs effected by mercury and compromised in their ability to function under mercurys influence vitamin d which is produced in the skin is augmented to the much more active hormone forms first by the liver then the kidney if their function has been debilitated the conversion to the more active vitamin d forms may not occur as well these activated forms are essential for proper calcium uptake and utilization hence another nail in the coffin of calcium balance
7630638 there is a direct relationship between frequency of exposure to mercury and frequency of allergic ailments heavy metals block the functions of the lymphocytes and macrophages and thus block mans defensive systems
7630639 in 2007 california will launch the nations first statewide voluntary biomonitoring program to measure chemical contaminants in people and find out which pollutants are most common in the states residents the national institute of child health and human development next year will also begin a 2 5 billion study to track childrens exposures from birth to age 21 examining which chemicals are building up in the bodies of u s children and how they relate to individuals susceptibility to different diseases
7630640 a post mortem study showed that mercury from a mothers amalgam fillings could be absorbed by the fetus across the placenta
7630641 eighty percent of inhaled elementary mercury vapor is absorbed and can cross the blood brain barrier or reach the placenta
7630642 dr williamson adds that mercury from dental amalgams is often stored in breast milk in much greater concentrations than in the mothers tissues and the amount of mercury in breast milk is likewise directly proportional to the number of amalgams the mother has in her mouth heavy metal toxicity in general and mercury toxicity in particular can have a very damaging effect on fertility mercury amalgams in teeth have been associated with a host of female complaints but especially difficulty conceiving outright sterility and spontaneous abortions miscarriages likewise sperm count and motility in males can be greatly lowered

7630706 blinkered by religions into thinking that their misery is a punishment from a god who will give everyone his final judgment after the last trump such believers forget to judge for themselves they have no sense of government by the people for the people they are governed by blind dogma their sense of morality is what someone else tells them to do

7630715 without discounting the seriousness of the charges against jesse ray beard the fact that he now appears to want to take advantage of a means of getting the best education possible is heartening
7630716 the fact that the only way he was given this choice was through a tragic series of events points to inherent problems in our nations educational system that must be rectified
7630717 they say that every dark cloud has a silver lining in this case jesse ray beard is laying the groundwork to give himself a second chance through a quality education at a reputable school this is unfortunately not a choice available to his classmates in jena
7630718 while beard may still be punished for what he allegedly did back in louisiana he is now taking advantage of something that could open up collegiate and career opportunities that were little more than a dream at jena high its a crime that parents and students everywhere dont have a similar ability to go to a school that provides ample opportunity

7630758 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7630759 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7630760 the american lung association is going to add it as a risk factor
7630761 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7630762 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7630763 its a population based study which means that you can make an association but not necessarily a conclusion
7630764 it probably promotes more work in the area of routine household items and things we need to be looking at more prospectively to make a clear cause and effect relationship
7630765 anything that affects air quality negatively is not a good thing
7630766 burning in general and the release of smoke these things are certainly to be avoided at the very least chemical irritants will set off asthma and thats reversible cancer is not reversible
7630767 this is not unlike the type of risk that one experiences from secondhand tobacco smoke
7630768 at the end of the day people who use incense casually i dont think thats a cause for major concern but those cultures which embrace incense as part of their daily lifestyles have to consider this has a real potential risk for cancer

7630878 i see the potential long term value in enable holdings and firmly believe in the companys new business model
7630879 they have positioned themselves well in the marketplace and as they grow i look forward to being part of it
7630880 i invested in this company because of their uniqueness and dominance in their space
7630881 over the last 10 years they have acquired a top brand vendor list and a large customer base i feel these attributes combined with the new multi channel platform position the company for significant and profitable growth

7630900 theyre thinking of salesforce com or google apps thats the thing they can see most out of this whole world of virtualized cloud enabled next generation it environment
7630901 but the it folks are looking at the underpinning technology virtualization and the business people are looking at it from the end deliverable which is software as a service

7630910 the ig says you should have gotten more our response is you know youre right
7630911 our concern is that the purchase of u s sugar and the resulting evisceration of the industry and its economic base in clewiston represents an extreme slash and burn position
7630912 we think its important that somebody stands up and tries to preserve those jobs
7630913 i have enjoyed some good fortune in my life we all have a duty to share our experiences and create positive opportunities this is an opportunity to help florida residents and i am pound to do it
7630914 there are many legitimate points of view the bottom line is we have very special circumstances in florida the state has a huge coastline that is vulnerable to hurricanes and that requires a unique tact
7630915 no one wants to cram a huge rate increase down anyones throat but we also have a fiduciary duty to the residents of florida who could be forced to pay insurance surcharges if citizens doesnt have enough money to pay claims i hope to examine the issue more thoroughly over the next several months
7630916 unfortunately as home replacement costs go up as our exposure goes up the issue of rates will have to be revisited it will have to be revisited on a continuing basis no one likes the idea of a rate increase time will tell q can citizens handle a major storm without the major claims handling problems that occurred in 2004 and to a lesser extent in 2005 a from everything i have seen citizens has made enormous strides towards preparedness and its ability to react and serve its policyholders we have just passed the fourth year anniversary of hurricane charley since charley citizens has added hundreds of employees and dramatically changed its organizational structure is any organization ever 100 percent ready one doesnt know until you are in the middle of it

7630919 i think it is an advantage because i dont have any bias i dont have any industry relationships that need to be protected
7630920 surprisingly the median household is just as good as the average professional economist
7630921 im a little surprised because economists are using sophisticated models but the consumers know whats happening with milk prices
7630922 it means economists need to improve their forecasting or at least be a little humble
7630923 inflation expectations are one of the most important factors in the economic environment
7630924 so if consumers lose confidence that could bring us into a bad economic situation
7630925 when theres rising inflation its beneficial to be in debt to purchase real assets because youll pay your debt back with money that wont be worth as much in the future
7630926 with high inflation you want to avoid bonds like the plague
7630927 by choosing joe biden barack obama has solidified the title as the most liberal ticket ever to be put forward by the democratic party

7631060 i am glad we have been able to kick start these initiatives and hope that down the line more support will be made available to continue any successful schemes
7631061 prostitution damages lives and corrodes communities and parliament has rightly acted to tackle the kerb crawlers who fuel this pernicious vice
7631062 projects such as those being funded in edinburgh are key to helping provide routes out of prostitution and to preventing others from becoming involved in the first place
7631063 its great that whh ranch agreed to stop packing goods in shredded checks but what sort of insanely reckless bank was handing them out to begin with

7631070 the return of these doctors is a positive thing because we are suffering from a severe shortage of personnel and we welcome doctors willing to their country
7631071 at previous conventions the parties and candidates would hope that the video would be shown to the television audience and if you were at home watching you might see it
7631072 but if you didnt catch the video about john kerry in 2004 your ability to see that video was pretty much lost

7631081 the catseat tm could revolutionize every american home with a cat
7631082 t he fact is that contrary to popular belief there was a shockingly high level of sadistic violence and gore in some of the most popular commercial entertainments of the 1950s
7631083 even the most vehement critics of contemporary popular culture would be hard pressed to find anything in todays mainstream mass entertainment as alarming as the gore drenched gun worshipping fantasies that spillane and his publisher dished out for the delectation of millions of ordinary american readers in the supposedly halcyon days of the 1950s
7631084 level of carnage that remains unsurpassed in the history of televised childrens entertainment
7631085 considering the need to test the technology for sbinet and to complete that testing the idea is that the deployment dollars set aside for sbinet could be used to help offset the fencing costs

7631098 while we are all excited about the modern day clash of the culinary titans we really appreciate the cities chefs restaurants and the omni mandalay for making this event happen on behalf of our foundation
7631099 surprisingly the median household is just as good as the average professional economist
7631100 im a little surprised because economists are using sophisticated models but the consumers know whats happening with milk prices
7631101 it means economists need to improve their forecasting or at least be a little humble
7631102 inflation expectations are one of the most important factors in the economic environment
7631103 so if consumers lose confidence that could bring us into a bad economic situation
7631104 when theres rising inflation its beneficial to be in debt to purchase real assets because youll pay your debt back with money that wont be worth as much in the future
7631105 with high inflation you want to avoid bonds like the plague
7631106 everybodys in shock there are no words to describe it really the whole road loves them

7631108 the gun was ready to fire and he answered the phone

7631113 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7631114 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7631115 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7631116 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7631117 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7631118 we must do more for our online presence lets push facebook push facebook in the email newsletter
7631119 there is actually an agreement concluded between the two parties over the definite date which is 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7631120 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalized an agreement
7631121 errors will happen anytime you take a complex system and put human beings inside of it
7631122 the notion that you can train doctors to completely avoid mistakes is just false
7631123 many doctors are seeing between 30 and 40 patients per day
7631124 what if everything around you isnt quite what it seems what if all the world you think you know is an elaborate dream and if you look at your reflection is that all you want to be what if you could look right through the crack would you find yourself find yourself afraid to see what if all the worlds inside of your head just creations of your own your devils and your gods and the living and the dead and you really are alone you can live in this illusion you can choose to believe you keep looking but you cant find words are you hiding in the trees what if everything around you isnt quite what as seems

7631129 mircea rednic a fost nehotarit in privinta lotului cind l am anuntat ca l am adus pe tamas incepea sa aiba framintari pe cine baga pe el sau pe goian care a fost cel mai bun de pina acum mijlocul a pierdut meciul acolo unde rapidul ne a dominat ai nostri nu alergau deloc de parca dormeau pe teren
7631130 ma deranjeaza ca tamas venit de doua zile la dinamo a fost cel mai bun jucator din echipa marius niculae a evoluat bine a alergat enorm si a recuperat peste 80 din mingi
7631131 la ce lot are anul acesta mircea rednic nu are voie sa rateze titlul lotul actual este opeste cel din 1999 cand la dinamo evolua si mutu
7631132 heres the problem if fannie mae and freddie mac collapsed then probably the financial system would receive such a body blow that it could be disastrous
7631133 i think long term what we have to do is we have to go ahead and make a decision if these are public entities then maybe they ought to get out of the profit making business
7631134 and if theyre private entities that we dont bail them out
7631135 were going to have to structure that carefully how we make that transition in order that we dont get the housing market even more spooked than it already is
7631136 in washington we need people with character we need people who will stand up and say no when theres time to say no we need people who arent part of this partisan politics that want to blame everybody and can bring people together to get things done and we need people with character who can stand up to special interests
7631137 we need to bring our soldiers home but we need to do it in a smart way so that we dont make the situation in iraq much worse
7631138 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate
7631139 for somebody who is going to potentially be president of the united states you dont want to have to look to a trainer or a supervisor or a mentor i think the fact that he has that lack of experience is concerning
7631140 i would also note that obama has been rated by most non partisan groups as one of the highest partisan voters in the u s congress or the senate biden is just one or two notches away from him theyve got two kind of echo chambers when it comes to being extremely partisan in their voting record
7631141 the voters take the full measure of a candidate and they look at his or her life experiences and part of that is where you grew up who we are is in part where were from because of it helps shape some of our thinking and some of our values its certainly not that only that thing voters look at but i think its one thing that informs them gives them a little insight into the person
7631142 he has a lifetime record objectively measured of attracting independent and swing voters some of the characteristics would include number one hes a straight shooter a straight talker i think midwesterners appreciate that number two hes authentic what you see is what you get number three hes a bit of a populist bit of a maverick
7631143 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate
7631144 the idea is that theyll get the severance agreement negotiated under the contract
7631145 and they will save someone with less seniority from facing layoffs
7631146 our members have taken enough hits over the last couple of years
7631147 and new management under mark frisby has realized there are layers and layers of management that havent been touched
7631148 there was actually a rumor last week that the inquirer would be folded into the daily news
7631149 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the indian courts decision
7631150 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary
7631151 a large transformational deal is highly unlikely not impossible but highly unlikely
7631152 we dont need to do a deal organic growth is the core growth engine in this company
7631153 we come from a culture where bigger is not better you get bigger by being better you dont get better by being bigger
7631154 were not going to hit five home runs in a game and we dont have anyone with 75 rbis

7631158 deeply discounted distressed sales continue to drive volume in many regions of the state
7631159 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs
7631160 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investments such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck
7631161 that re emphasised our commitment to australia and that it is an ongoing commitment
7631162 this is incredibly dramatic for a global perception of china and also for chinas self perception that it can handle something on this scale
7631163 its a kind of financial coming of age itll be an important marker probably in a positive direction as far as we can tell at the moment
7631164 that aggrieved nationalism was the dominant narrative for half a century so the chinese communist party staked its own legitimacy on overcoming all this humiliation
7631165 now china has stood up in the world its clear for everybody to see this offers china a chance to bury this aggrieved baggage theyve carried with them and stand more confidently in the world
7631166 this is not only for sportsmen and women to prove something its for the nation to prove something
7631167 this is a prosperous nation people are doing well and thats more important than simply winning medals from the games
7631168 i spoke to one western guy he said before for him his image of china was 1989 the crackdown now its the birds nest
7631169 i think the government could have taken this as a good opportunity to address the real issues to crack down on corruption to improve the rule of law to open up the media to provide more channels for people to express their grievances
7631170 but instead to absolutely guarantee the smooth operations the government tries to hide the problem and takes excessive measures
7631171 government has to do something to improve chinese soccer skills
7631172 to do that they have to take care of widespread corruption hold officials responsible for failure follow the rule of law in that category i think sports could trigger revolution not radical revolution but piece by piece
7631173 we need to make sure there is transparency honesty and no perverse incentives in the benchmarks
7631174 i know him not as a politician but as a husband and a father and a man and i want to talk about that and why i think hell be an extraordinary president
7631175 our story is the great american story of success and pulling yourself up
7631176 i dont know a woman on this planet who isnt a little bit concerned right now about the direction of this country
7631177 my life isnt following that tough trajectory because weve been fortunate but i know those struggles so clearly and those struggles are universal they defy race and party and religion
7631178 theyll understand that barack gets these struggles in a way that his opponent doesnt get
7631179 throughout my life i have not paid much attention about what people say about me who dont know me
7631180 but i dont let that define me i have been the same person that i was when i started along this journey with barack
7631181 i dont hear people asking me whether im angry or not
7631182 they want to know what barack is going to do to put this country on the right track
7631183 folks are not doing this because theyre cynical or believe that barack is a cynical candidate
7631184 i know his plans and policies and theres nothing cynical about it
7631185 i want people to understand who we are as a family what our values are

7631190 make sure home buyers have honest and complete information about their mortgage options
7631191 provide meaningful incentives for lenders to buy or refinance existing mortgages and convert them into stable 30 year fixed mortgages
7631192 neither lenders nor homeowners would receive a windfall from this plan
7631193 helping low income borrowers get additional time and support to pay back any losses from the sale of their home and waiving certain state and local income taxes that result from an individual selling their home to avoid foreclosure
7631194 speculators people who bought vacation homes or people who falsely represented their income
7631195 clarify and ease the ability of loan servicers to act on behalf of
7631196 provide direct relief to many homeowners who are struggling to maintain their mortgage payments
7631197 if you want to declare bankruptcy you can renegotiate your mortgage on your second home but not your primary home who thought that rule up
7631198 to help families facing foreclosure refinance and to enable low and moderate income first time home buyers purchase a home
7631199 provide potential borrowers with a simplified standardized borrower metric for home mortgages
7631200 allow individuals to easily compare various mortgage products and understand the full cost of the loan

7631207 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7631208 with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7631209 it is extremely disappointing that the greens have chosen to offer wide ranging criticism much of it based on speculation rather than fact
7631210 whilst currently the rainfall has ceased unfortunately the effect will continue to impact on groundwater levels for some time
7631211 it is important that we acknowledge that the buffer storage ponds hold treated effluent
7631212 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7631213 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7631214 i am concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see they always tried for a fourth judge because it followed the format of the original show pop idol we havent had much luck with that working but were gonna give it another try
7631215 it takes the fun out of all the hard work i do to push those kids through
7631216 one way or another it s clear that improved efficiency in food production and water use will be needed in a world of growing populations seeking decent lives as the new report explains more than a billion people now live in areas with insufficient water rising demand for agricultural products that require large amounts of water particularly beef cattle and biofuel crops is adding to shortages
7631217 lets not forget dell is still highly tied to the u s more so than hp is which is much more diversified on a global basis in terms of markets
7631218 they are trying to grow international markets they are trying to come up with some channel strategies so i think thats helping them
7631219 it could be argued that ibm had strength in the high end and dell had strength in the low end of x86 plus a nice kick in its 4 socket business
7631220 i am yet to be convinced they are luring new customers
7631221 i think sun with its ultrasparc and x86 has not been effectively selling outside their traditional customer base
7631222 these special cocktails need to be shared with the world
7631223 the indian market as of now is growing rapidly and we want to target the animation and content development industry with the 3g coming to india we are also eyeing the communications companies as these will see a huge demand for large data storage
7631224 its important that the system is cost effective as well as scaleable in india therefore we are targeting india with storage systems that start from 246 terabyte to a petabyte 1024 terabyte to multiple petabytes that include the computer system storage system and software
7631225 the citys population is growing by 15 percent each year and were still maintaining 1998 staffing levels
7631226 its clear we have to employ technology to protect our community
7631227 so now we know where every vehicle is and instead of sending the assigned car to a 911 call we send the closest one
7631228 we also know where the first responding officers backup unit is and we can let them know immediately
7631229 we are constantly monitoring our crime patterns to head off any foothold criminals may get in a certain area
7631230 we respond to the slightest increase in violent crime of course but also try to discourage the car thieves and drug dealers as well as gang activity
7631231 crime reports provides us with a service that we control we can change and we can use internally as well as make information available to the public in real time or with a few hours delay
7631232 they provide the hardware software updates and we have a multifaceted crime mapping application that is very cost effective
7631233 chief davis and his staff are forward looking providing timely location specific information to the public when some law enforcement agencies are reluctant to do so
7631234 everyone can have access to the information they need instantly without the cost of installing and maintaining hardware and software systems
7631235 no well keep our data in house and control it
7631236 if anyone hacked into their system the only information they would get is information we wanted to be public anyway there is no way to go back and query our internal servers by hacking into crime reports computers
7631237 the way the service is designed we work with an agency to evaluate the information they want to make public in this case 911 calls involving only those relating to a crime report excluding sensitive information like investigative leads hoaxes and requests for information are entered into the data stream we receive
7631238 if you are concerned at all about where crime is occurring in your neighborhood this will let you know in a timely manner
7631239 we have the information at our fingertips now the next step is getting it to officers in the field in real time and transmitting video in real time to assist in the apprehension of suspects before they get too far from the crime scene
7631240 the san jose police department can now spend more time on vehicle code enforcement as opposed to citation entry and correction
7631241 the ticketworks solution dramatically decreases the number of errors and avoids the need to enter data into two systems the technology will also provide us with the ability to access citation data during critical investigations
7631242 easy to use automated entry forms to the officers will be updated periodically whenever there are changes in city and state traffic ordinances
7631243 ticketworks not only reduces time spent on entering data and making corrections to citations on the handheld devices but it also provides a complete back end system that allows individual officers to track their own tickets and supervisors to better manage citywide allocation of resources
7631244 that information doesnt do anybody any good if its not available in a timely manner
7631245 our strategy to provide our first responders and investigators with a clear picture of an incident including the location of available units recent citation information and historical crime data is going to keep san jose the safest big city in america
7631246 we want to give our officers in the field the edge on criminals by instantly knowing their whereabouts and containing an incident to an immediate area but ultimately real time information in the field will enhance officer safety and effectiveness
7631247 tsmc sat on the sidelines for several years but now appears convinced that mems is ready for prime time with consumer electronics and mobile applications

7631267 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
7631268 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
7631269 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
7631270 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
7631271 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
7631272 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
7631273 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7631274 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7631275 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7631276 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7631277 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7631278 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7631279 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7631280 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7631281 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
7631282 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
7631283 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
7631284 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
7631285 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
7631286 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
7631287 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7631288 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7631289 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
7631290 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
7631291 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
7631292 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
7631293 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
7631294 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
7631295 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
7631296 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
7631297 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
7631298 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
7631299 such is the satirists dilemma whats good for business is usually bad for humanity
7631300 it is all very tragic and yet i am amused by everything in this story starting with the fact that the husbands first choice was to reconcile with his estranged wife that is a man who does not recognize nuance
7631301 we have a chance to get peyton activated and out to practice so well see how that goes
7631302 i think well ease him in and see how he practices and what hes able to do
7631303 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys who has to step up and take advantage of it
7631304 im more concerned with the team that we have right here in our locker room and that this team mentally prepares itself as best we can
7631305 as always well continue to research all of our options
7631306 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature
7631307 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7631308 he has not been bouncing back and forth like brett favre
7631309 i would think that both of them have gotten to the point where we feel confident we can win with both of them
7631310 ive got four tailbacks there we may start two at one time
7631311 i know its important who takes the first snap to a lot of people but for us its more important to play the guys we feel we can win with
7631312 this is all new now but i feel a lot more comfortable now than i did last year
7631313 weve been putting the offense in and i cant wait to finally put it on the field and see what we can do
7631314 theres five or six on offense weve got eight nine maybe 10 true freshmen that will play for the first time this weekend thats why im a little nervous but im also excited for them
7631315 we kind of deal with a spread offense every day
7631316 its an advantage practicing against the spread we feel well be ready for an up tempo pace
7631317 theyre solid theres really no weak spots and theyre a veteran team
7631318 its not like were opening up against somebody we can mess around and play awful and win
7631319 a photolog of new york with an emphasis on urban decay strange signage and general weirdness
7631320 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
7631321 its a confidential deal and the buyer wants anonymity but i can tell you it is not mr trump and its not john mccain
7631322 when it comes to rounding up john edwards news and links i cant hope to compete with deceiver
7631323 thank you for your awesome posts deceiver is by far the best new blog i discovered this year
7631324 thank you for having the balls to cut through the spin and hype
7631325 oh my god can i come and work for you people
7631326 it is nice to get intellectual about something that really has no bearing on anyones life
7631327 another blog filled with the angry ramblings of the jealous and envious
7631328 interesting that most of the hypocrisy comes from popular and attractive women
7631329 love your site btw im so through with all that nasty perez like gossip based on nothing
7631330 how did i ever live without the keen insights and cutting observations of deceiver

7631340 i am asking you to those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me during the primary
7631341 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumour of controversy than the fact of unity
7631342 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so
7631343 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
7631344 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7631345 we have decided to quit the coalition and sit on the opposition benches in parliament
7631346 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7631347 the ppp also violated the latest agreement reached earlier this month that the judges will be restored 24 hours after the resignation of musharraf
7631348 the ppp even nominated zardari for president and announced the election schedule without consulting our party
7631349 struggle for restoration of the judges and genuine democracy in pakistan
7631350 we have requested saeed uz zaman siddiqui to accept our offer to become presidential candidate
7631351 he is a good pakistani who is a non partisan person
7631352 despite the break up of the coalition both parties should continue to work for the stability of the country
7631353 we will play the role of constructive opposition and will not create hurdles for the ppp government
7631354 we are sad over nawaz sharifs decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government
7631355 die russische invasion in georgien darf das land nicht von seinen zielen abhalten

7631367 i was really happy then my whole world was dark then but it was like a light like a lighthouse
7631368 so youre saying its pointless for me to be here
7631369 because of that misunderstanding you probably felt very disappointed and angry at jin soo when you start to care for someone isnt that what happens you feel more disappointment and more anger
7631370 its about waiting i wait for these guys and these guys wait for me we wait for each other and come to happiness
7631371 we hope to boost our nationally distributed cataloging efforts as well as providing new customer friendly services like a quick turnaround specialty sign shop
7631372 we would like to personally thank the state of wisconsin department of commerce the mmac metropolitan milwaukee association of commerce and the village of brown deer for their diligent efforts to help a growing wisconsin based business stay in wisconsin we will look to boost our employment immediately
7631373 no definitive timeline or specific plans are in place at this time for the property
7631374 the joining of these two great companies represents a strategic move that better aligns both organizations with the newly formed miller coors joint venture building upon each companies recognized strengths in delivering exemplary customer service and developing long standing relationships within local operating communities
7631375 this is a joining of two great organizations and we fully intend to build on the strong consumer loyalty to the miller brands in milwaukee county
7631376 this deal gives us long term continuity and combines the forces of a bigger better and stronger service organization to serve our customers and offer consumers an expanded array of top flight brands

7631389 im extremely pleased to announce the launch of tracemonkey an evolution of firefoxs spidermonkey javascript engine for firefox 3 1 that uses a new kind of just in time jit compiler to boost js performance by an order of magnitude or more
7631390 for years many of us have been salivating over the idea of jited javascript in the browser adobes jiting flash vm virtual machine showed a preview of tremendous speed gains to be had but weve had to wait until squirrelfish from webkit to see anything dramatic happen in the browser until now
7631391 a fantastic new improvement to mozillas javascript engine spidermonkey has landed code named tracemonkey this engine utilizes a technique called trace trees which adds just in time native code compilation to spidermonkey
7631392 a major goal of the project has been to set javascript up to compete with natively compiled code rather than simply against other interpreters this means that were starting to see speeds that are completely out of this league when it comes to performance
7631393 were supporting a bunch of platforms out of the box including arm so were supporting mobile firefox
7631394 we have right now x86 x86 64 and arm support in tracemonkey this means we are ready for mobile and desktop target platforms out of the box
7631395 tracemonkey advances us toward the mozilla 2 future where even more firefox code is written in js firefox gets faster and safer as this process unfolds
7631396 these are the early results from a project weve been calling tracemonkey which adds native code compilation to mozillas javascript engine spidermonkey based on a technique developed at uc irvine called trace trees and building on code and ideas shared with the tamarin tracing project a few of us have spent the last 2 months and most of the last few nights teaching spidermonkey some exciting new tricks
7631397 you record the instructions the interpreter is executing like a vcr
7631398 were looking at putting this tracing jit into our native c dom document object model code base
7631399 were going to make our dom traceable well move a lot of our code into javascript
7631400 javascript with tracemonkey will be so fast people can do ports of games
7631401 only a start with tracing performance will keep going up we have easy small linear speedup tasks remaining better register allocation spill reduction around built in calls we will trace string and regular expression code we will even trace into dom methods the tracing jit approach scales as you move more code into js or otherwise into view of the tracing machinery
7631402 it means that javascript is no longer confined by the previously challenging resource of processing power with this improvement its leapfrogged any sort of traditional and has gone head to head with computationally powerful languages like c
7631403 applications that are number heavy like image manipulation or object heavy like relational object structures
7631404 the primary thing holding back most extensive canvas development hasnt been rendering but the processor limitations of the language performing the challenging mathematical operations related to vectors matrices or collision detection
7631405 i expect this area to absolutely explode after the release of firefox 3 1 as we start to see this work take hold
7631406 i believe that other browsers will follow our lead and take javascript performance through current interpreter speed barriers using just in time native code compilation
7631407 beyond what tracemonkey means for firefox and other mozilla projects it heralds the javascript lightspeed future weve all been anticipating we are moving the goal posts and changing the game for the benefit of all web developers
7631408 toda la campa a de agresi n contra alba es una jugada de estados unidos para frenar lo que no va a frenar porque hay una revoluci n y un proceso de cambio en am rica latina

7631427 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
7631428 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
7631429 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
7631430 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
7631431 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
7631432 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
7631433 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
7631434 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
7631435 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug
7631436 has already been shown to have selective anticancer activity in preclinical studies and this finding may stimulate the development of a novel class of small anticancer compounds
7631437 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics
7631438 we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
7631439 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
7631440 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
7631441 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
7631442 this work underscores the value of scientific collaborations between large scale structural centers and individual biomedical research labs

7631450 at the black sea resort of sochi syrian president bashar assad told reporters thursday aug 21 that he is considering a russian request to deploy missiles in his country in view of russian western tensions over the georgian conflict which he said had polarized east and west anew
7631451 assads arrival coincided with a visit by a large syrian military delegation thursday at the russian weapons manufacturing giant the kalinin machines plant east of moscow debkafiles military sources report that this plant makes sophisticated anti air missile systems including the s 300 and the buk m for which damascus is bidding

7631453 we only have 7 000 residents and were providing services that towns such as peachtree city with a population of 40 000 provide
7631454 this provided an exceptional and unique opportunity to examine risk and resilience processes in such a heavily burdened population
7631455 these findings highlight the potential importance of community mental health efforts as protective resources in times of traumatic stress more research on the subject is necessary to determine the extent to which support helps students cope with the difficulties
7631456 this may be a unique path toward potential drug development
7631457 if we are able to understand the genetic cues involved in rapid python heart muscle increases and decreases that to me says there is the potential to develop therapeutics for humans

7631459 we think several of the striking changes we see in python physiology may have significant potential for the pharmaceutical industry
7631460 we are very pleased to have the opportunity to assist zafgen in its efforts to find novel and effective therapies to combat obesity

7631472 i am incredibly proud of our faculty and their commitment to discovery and scholarship
7631473 when out of despair and exhaustion they find christ to be alive and alive in them the discovery has been revolutionary
7631474 our clientele is ready to discover a different kind of love and were almost always the first stop for curious people who want to find their counterpart with or without fangs
7631475 it will be so nice to eat something that doesnt have a wrapper
7631476 todos os homens gostariam de ter filhos n o digo todos mas cerca de 95 por cento sim
7631477 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalized an agreement
7631478 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7631479 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7631480 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7631481 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament arent ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7631482 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7631483 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and cannot grant full immunity
7631484 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament
7631485 without the approval of the iraqi government and american forces
7631486 south lebanon has been turned into an arena for hizbullah activities
7631487 recommending the extension of the unifil mandate until august 31 2009
7631488 if a war were to happen as they are threatening our victory this time will be decisive unquestionable and final
7631489 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7631490 russia needs to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
7631491 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7631492 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7631493 i expect that the russian president wont sign the resolution
7631494 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7631495 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7631496 what russia decides to do with regard to the wto is up to russia but it should be very clear that its not business as usual with russia
7631497 we have made that point numerous times we would continue to make that case until russia decides to change its behavior
7631498 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7631499 the release of this group fills us with joy but we will not be satisfied until all prisoners are released the 11 000 who are still waiting
7631500 there will be no peace without the release of all our prisoners
7631501 this is a day of joy for the fighters of freedom and independence
7631502 it is like a wedding celebration for the palestinian people but our joy will not be complete until all palestinian prisoners are released
7631503 this is a big day we have been awaiting for 32 years
7631504 it is not easy to release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7631505 to provide an update on the latest developments on electoral issues
7631506 transform the electoral culture in lebanon by promoting a law that guarantees open democratic and participatory elections and to create opportunities for lebanese citizens to lead change
7631507 before june 23 the committee had only met four times but since then it has met over ten times
7631508 we are already late in these reforms they should have been made one or two years ago
7631509 basically ccer is providing mps with information to tell them that yes we can implement these reforms and this is how we do it
7631510 so the justice and interior ministries will in one form or another supervise
7631511 we are still waiting to hear from isf chief ashraf rifi on whether this is possible or not if it isnt elections will be held over a saturday and sunday
7631512 with the return of the 1960 electoral law based on 25 county electoral districts having a quota for women is no longer feasible as you already have a sectarian quota
7631513 this issue remains a big demand of ccer but for now the best thing we can do is to encourage as many women as possible to run
7631514 if you compare what was being said about electoral reform one year ago to what is being said today so much progress has been made
7631515 we are talking about real reform now and this is basically due to the efforts of ccer to lobby mps
7631516 our efforts are not yet over the committee will finish its work soon and will submit the draft electoral law to speaker nabih berri who will put it on the parliamentary agenda for the general assembly to vote on article by article
7631517 until the ministry of interior gets the green light to implement these reforms there is still a lot of lobbying to be done inside and outside of the justice and administration parliamentary committee
7631518 a policeman assigned to guard the archangel michael church in deshasha in beni soueif province south of cairo hit three women while they were taking sand into the church to fix the floor which was cracked as result of water collection underneath
7631519 the worrying rise in sectarian tension that we have seen in deshasha is a direct result of violations committed by the police
7631520 this incident must be investigated and those responsible held accountable
7631521 the archangel michael church in deshasha is but one example of the futility of any efforts to reform and unify construction and renovation laws for places of worship so long as security agents continue to violate existing laws in a discriminatory manner and with complete impunity
7631522 all parties are committed to implementing the doha agreement in this regard but it is left for parliament to decide whether to adopt the law at once or do that in different stages
7631523 the committee will be done studying the reforms in three weeks this way parliament will vote on the law and the reforms altogether instead of adopting the law first and postponing the reforms to a later stage
7631524 we have a draft proposal by mp amin sherri asking parliament to adopt the new electoral law the speaker will simply present the proposal to vote and lawmakers will decide the fate of this proposal
7631525 if the majority of lawmakers decide to approve the proposal parliament will ratify the new electoral law otherwise the entire issue will be postponed to another session
7631526 it makes no difference if parliament adopts the law first and the reforms at a later stage or adopts both the law and the reforms in one session both scenarios will yield the same result
7631527 the new electoral law should be adopted tomorrow delaying this should be out of question
7631528 i dont understand why some are hesitant about adopting the new law which was approved by 14 people in doha
7631529 the issue of introducing reforms should not be used as an excuse for not ratifying the law tomorrow
7631530 i advise the critics of my southern tour to go ahead and visit the south it would be a chance to see if they will be welcomed or not
7631531 the president was a former army chief and he can deal with this issue
7631532 like any other institution the cabinet should have internal regulations that organize its functioning
7631533 the post of deputy premier is not recognized by the constitution but yet it remains to be a customary post this has been the case for years
7631534 it seems that the new law does not suit some politicians within the march 14 camp
7631535 even some reforms such as lowering the voting age to 18 are not in their advantage
7631536 mashhadani left al hussein medical center on sunday night after treatment he was in good health
7631537 they were having the feast when a stranger walked in and blew himself up it is a criminal act i cant believe a muslim man could do it
7631538 all those who were killed are innocent people what did the children do what did the women do most of those killed are elderly people
7631539 we played an important role in establishing diplomatic relations between syria and lebanon
7631540 we can help in solving them not by interfering but at the request of both countries
7631541 all kouchner heard about the hopes difficulties and wishes of all the lebanese to live in an independent democratic and sovereign lebanon
7631542 i have noted the goodwill in continuing this process by setting a date for an exchange of ambassadors which will be before the end of the year im happy about that
7631543 one must always take threats seriously both those made by israel and by mr nasrallah because this is a very inflammatory region

7631559 according to the latest information 65 people were killed 22 were hospitalized with various injuries and three returned home after receiving medical help
7631560 the remaining foreigners on board the boeing died their names are being checked as several corpses were received at the morgue without documentation
7631561 suddenly there was a fire and lots of smoke my eyes were sore it became very hard to breathe
7631562 then i saw another iranian escape by the planes rear door i ran and fell to the ground
7631563 we screamed for help luckily my two sisters also survived
7631564 everywhere around the site there were body parts of the unfortunate passengers you could hear screams and moans there was a horrible stench of burning bodies
7631565 our three telephones were ringing incessantly people were crying could not speak yelling at us demanding to know how we allowed such a tragedy there were children there young athletes and their parents grief was overwhelming
7631566 people were kissing what remained of their loved ones even we who should be used to anything could not look at this and turned away not to begin crying too
7631567 i swear to allah that i do not know them they were strangers
7631568 one of the womens names was maybe fadhila and the other was called widad
7631569 no no they put it on me and told me to take it off at home
7631570 i did not disconnect it because maybe it fell from me
7631571 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda in iraq and its practices
7631572 the seven vessels went as far as eight miles from the coast watched by israeli navy patrol boats which circled around them
7631573 this is likely linked to the fact that last year a lot of iraqis were permitted to stay while this year a lot have had their asylum applications rejected
7631574 we are accusing the government of mismanagement of public funds undermining security and lack of a development vision
7631575 i am here to say yes to this motion and sack the current government

7631580 io sono amministratore delegato di atlantia e di autostrade per litalia
7631581 siamo pronti ad accettare qualunque decisione anche quella di congelare completamente i rapporti
7631582 riteniamo che sarebbe un errore sospendere tutti i contatti tra la russia e la nato in un momento in cui sono cos necessari
7631583 oggi evidente che dopo laggressione georgiana contro lossezia del sud i rapporti tra questi due paesi e tra la georgia e labkhazia non possono tornare a essere quelli di prima
7631584 le popolazioni dellossezia del sud e dellabkhazia hanno il diritto di essere indipendenti
7631585 e essenziale che la russia fornisca aggiornate e puntuali informazioni sui tempi e modi della sua completa attuazione
7631586 we are delighted to have david on our staff here at penn state

7631588 so if you havent heard the word the rep is bursting with new energy
7631589 it promises to help make kansas city a source of theatrical innovation for the rest of the country to follow
7631590 we think our approach to all our marketing is going to be really different
7631591 weve got cool plans to release micro pages and web sites about specific shows
7631592 were not doing a very good job of reaching people who arent already going to the theater
7631593 we want to try to catch em off guard and get em to think maybe ive been missing out on live theater amp 61486
7631594 well be doing things that we think will appeal to a younger audience without alienating our longtime subscribers

7631602 the un urges restraint and calls for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that the injured may be evacuated
7631603 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7631604 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7631605 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7631606 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties up to now we have 27 confirmed dead and 75 wounded
7631607 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7631608 we called off regular patrols in kalma because it is not part of our mandate to search for arms and arrest individuals
7631609 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7631610 a unamid police and military force accessed the camp we are prepared for possible assistance in the case of evacuating any type of casualties
7631611 is the first year when production has reached the level prior to that of saddam husseins fall
7631612 the increase in the generation of electricity has been achieved by repairing some old plants and installing some new ones
7631613 distribution is now much improved as sabotage has been eliminated to a very high extent because the security situation is much better this has affected our network now most of the network is in operation
7631614 there are still some lines which were sabotaged two or three years ago and now we are trying to rebuild them
7631615 the capacity of iraqi power stations is actually far higher but plants are so outdated and in bad shape that they frequently shut slashing generation to less than half of the 13 000 mw of nominal capacity
7631616 we may face a very serious problem if we do not put in place new power generation
7631617 the need for energy will be much more we have millions of iraqis outside iraq if these people return to iraq this means that new projects would be needed this is a pressing need
7631618 he has authorized us to negotiate directly with companies of international standing
7631619 there is no doubt whatsoever that if we had unlimited means everyone of us could fully allocate to the issues that we define as important and we could all celebrate the state budget very nicely
7631620 focus on your goals but just dont get caught focusing
7631621 would examine and revise procedures taken regarding the new refinery project
7631622 tests were completed over the weekend the pipeline is back in service
7631623 the volume depends on how fast we can raise production rates
7631624 the tanks at ceyhan have been filled and petrol exports can recommence
7631625 quite frankly i think its more about the agent than the player when you look at the numbers it doesnt make sense for anyone expect the agent building a client base for next year
7631626 peters is also somewhat similar to the anquan boldin situation in phoenix
7631627 has become a textbook example of how a large it management framework vendor can effectively fill a gap in its offerings through acquisition
7631628 inconsistent with the concept of an open and accessible internet
7631629 the desire of certain security institutions to purchase aircraft helicopters and naval vessels
7631630 what is the purpose of this institutions purchase of the planes helicopters and warships will we reach the stage whereby we have one official and one unofficial army and where we cannot decide which one to preserve
7631631 similar to the resistances weapons in order to confront israeli violations
7631632 we have nine external managers including five for emerging markets and four in high yield debt we are currently conferring with legal counsel on the impact of the ruling and what legal option should be taken
7631633 our concern is that our members pensions would not be subjected to risky investments that will endanger the future of the pension system we are reviewing the court decision to see what the impact is on both of those issues
7631634 njea is disappointed that the court will allow the state to pursue riskier investments with the state pension fund
7631635 njea is pleased however that the court held that outside contractors could not be hired by the state to manage these funds
7631636 i want people to get used to graffiti as art and not as something bad
7631637 carry peace in your heart not weapons in your hands
7631638 that was a very emotional poster and it touched me deeply
7631639 the last war was basically a street war with guns my art is a reaction to what im living in and a statement to the public
7631640 i want to push people and the mind of the designer
7631641 participation was more minimal from ad agencies than the public
7631642 these seconds when im shakin leave me shudderin for days
7631643 housing is not out of the woods and that means banks arent either
7631644 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7631645 we have a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7631646 its extremely important to just keep making forward progress rather than prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7631647 ultimately gaza has to be resolved and it has to be resolved on the basis of abbas program for it
7631648 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7631649 we will be honest to answer your all problem and welcome to test our honesty
7631650 hope sincerely to have glad and long term business relationship with you
7631651 it must be weird not having anybody cum on you
7631652 i couldnt believe id said it i didnt know why id said it id never said it before
7631653 shimmering dazzling nearly blinding brightness that made me cover my eyes with my hands
7631654 i find it mind boggling that with nearly 70 percent of americans describing themselves as christians and witnessing the success of the passion of the christ and the chronicles of narnia that hollywood still doesnt do the kinds of faith based and family value entertainment that people are desperate to see
7631655 the rich amp infamous brand is sculpted from snoop doggs trend savvy classic vision
7631656 for snoop dogg the name represents a fraternity of sorts from presidents to gangsters whove been able to endure the burden of gaining wealth at any cost garnering equal parts admiration and disdain these men savor the fruits and relish the spotlight
7631657 google tv ads are bought using an auction model and through a single online interface that is already familiar to agencies and advertisers so like adwords advertising program
7631658 with anonymized data from set top boxes google will be able to target ads by demographic daypart and channel
7631659 it was a little disappointing it lasted for about 25 minutes and then we passed out
7631660 it was the thought in my mind when i first ran for office
7631661 so in a way the fact that biden will be on this ticket is the perfect bookmark for my own political career
7631662 we love senator biden hes our third senator in pennsylvania
7631663 les pido a ustedes que me han apoyado y a quienes siempre les estar agradecida que trabajen tan duro en favor de barack obama como lo han hecho por m durante las primarias
7631664 ahora estamos reunidos en denver para prometer nuestro apoyo y para unirnos detr s del pr ximo presidente de estados unidos barack obama
7631665 y lo que tengo que decir es que soy hillary clinton y no apruebo estos mensajes
7631666 ni abjasia ni osetia del sur volver n a vivir en el mismo estado que georgia
7631667 es nuestro destino geopol tico tr gico pero nadie puede legalizar la anexi n de territorios georgianos
7631668 respetar la integridad territorial y la soberan a de georgia
7631669 no depend a de la decisi n de un solo
7631670 supongo que el presidente ruso no va a firmar esta resoluci n ya que provocar a una situaci n muy dif cil y cr tica para la seguridad territorial de georgia
7631671 i was supposed to be calling the shots i was hoh
7631672 there is an agreement actually reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7631673 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7631674 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7631675 has become a textbook example of how a large it management framework vendor can effectively fill a gap in its offerings through acquisition
7631676 brooke and i are thrilled shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for
7631677 seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 perhaps a boy awaits us
7631678 my friend an army soldier was on the bus and he called me right before the explosion
7631679 it was the hardest and worst moment of my life
7631680 after my friend died i live in fear a person in tripoli goes out expecting something bad to happen
7631681 in june i sent a letter to the interior ministry asking them to not allow the army to take busses from this area because it is too dangerous
7631682 i saw the explosion heard the sound of the blast then a black fog was everywhere
7631683 someones leg was over here i tried to help but got sick from the sight and smell of the bodies
7631684 if god wanted me to die i would have died
7631685 there is no solution to the conflict in tripoli maybe when the powerful find a solution then our problems will be solved
7631686 we were at home at the time and everyone called us to see if we were ok
7631687 this is our way of life we are expecting every minute that something will happen here and we dont know where or when they will attack again
7631688 i think the bombing happened because tripoli is the last gate of conflict between iraq and the united states whoever wins here will control the region
7631689 the conflict is not in bab al tabbaneh anymore now it is next door
7631690 i think we are in a long dark tunnel and the solution is outside of lebanon
7631691 the problem was conceived outside of lebanon and was delivered inside of lebanon
7631692 it makes me want to go out more because the next day i might die
7631693 nagyon izgatottak vagyunk a legjobb mostohaanya akit sam lola s cassandra k v nhat l tom mennyire szereti a h rom gyerekemet brooke biztos vagyok benne hogy fantasztikus anya lesz
7631694 a new box doesnt make these films any better george nice try there is nothing new in this set folks so dont bother
7631695 are scouting for girls really so witless as to think singing a song about a nuclear attack on london would be appropriate for what is a celebration of london ideally not being attacked
7631696 the basic idea of the new latitude is that the machine will have a second arm based processor and linux operating system along side the standard intel processor and windows os
7631697 having played at the real life wedding of two of the stars of bbc 1s spooks miranda raison and raza jaffrey the band called in a favour and asked the duo the help them create a hostile reception as part of the plot

7631699 shahid was shooting for vishal bharadwajs kaminay in pune this was august 11 the birthday of his childhood friend shriram who lives in bangalore so shahid called shriram to pune saying that he had some urgent work and needed his friend to come to pune it was only when shriram came to pune that he realized that shahid had thrown a surprise birthday get together for him also shahid had earlier requested vishal bharadwaj to allow him to pack up early so that he could spend more time with his childhood friend vishal and the entire crew of kaminay were not only surprised but also moved to see this human side of shahid

7631704 it has been an extremely difficult decision to take given my burning desire to represent europe again in defending the ryder cup in the united states
7631705 but the fact that boston this week is my only opportunity to qualify for the final two play off events as well as being my final opportunity to play my 15 events on the us pga tour conflicts with my ambition to play gleneagles and earn my spot in the team
7631706 the captains picks are a nightmare and not a position i would have wanted where i need one but we do know that nick will do the right thing and i will be playing as hard as i can this week to add to my year and hopefully earn one

7631711 this is absolutely silly he said this case is silly the test failed and yet they passed its solipsistic nonsense

7631724 the postponement of champions trophy is a body blow to pakistan but since the country is run by wrong people i see more trouble for cricket in the country
7631725 the event is postponed until next year but if the current government trying to outdo musharraf stays i fear the situation could worsen rather than improve
7631726 it is not that we should not fight terrorism but the way musharraf led us into the war on terror by using gunship helicopters against our own people was fatal because as a blow back peace the economy and cricket have become casualties
7631727 under the situation when foreign investors are not willing to come to pakistan how can you expect foreign cricketers to travel to a country where we are fighting someone elses war
7631728 the way the outgoing chairman of the pakistan cricket board nasim ashraf spent funds for two years and now with the postponement of series after series pakistan cricket will soon run short of money

7631737 the ppp even nominated zardari for president and announced the election schedule without consulting our party
7631738 the ppp also violated the latest agreement that the judges will be restored 24 hours after the resignation of musharraf
7631739 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs
7631740 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investments such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck
7631741 that re emphasised our commitment to australia and that it is an ongoing commitment

7631743 its extraordinary that a health minister would not want to investigate this immediately
7631744 it seems to be a common technique of his doesnt it
7631745 ive only seen the footage once during the game i couldnt really remember much when he contacted me i sort of thought well hes hit me with the head but i thought the attempt might have been legitimate
7631746 it sort of glanced off me it wasnt the full impact
7631747 the first time he went at me i could see him coming at me and the second time i sort of backed away after referee lyndon bray told me to release the ball from the ruck and luckily for me i did because it sort of just glanced me but i wouldnt have liked to cop the full brunt
7631748 id have to say its probably the most enjoyable test that ive been involved in
7631749 i suppose looking back i wasnt expecting to be a part of this squad and to get a start against the springboks such a proud nation at probably what is my favourite stadium to play at at kings park absa stadium it was just a real honour and wins are at a premium over here
7631750 i have to manage it pretty well these days given my age
7631751 i do have to stay pretty warm when the guys start calling you things like tin man then it becomes a bit of an issue so its a constant reminder that i have to keep myself ready to play test football

7631755 i suppose its not something that im that happy about but its good to break it
7631756 ive had a couple of draws over here but never a win so i just sort of had goose bumps there for the last few minutes of the game when we realised that wed won it
7631757 i know every other time ive come over weve said how hard it is to play here and how not many teams win here
7631758 we never mentioned that at all this week we just focused on our own preparation and i think that was a pretty big factor in getting a result
7631759 we sort of had balance between our training and the guys getting away from rugby as well on their days off
7631760 robbie mentioned it in the change rooms that he was really happy how the boys used their downtime throughout the week to get out there and enjoy the place and really use it as a tour as opposed to a chore which i think a lot of teams that come here sort of think
7631761 i think once you get over that thing of playing in south africa and now the guys have felt what its like to win here then i think that could be pretty important for the group
7631762 weve already discussed that straight away in the change rooms
7631763 the last time i played a test there was when mandela was there so that was an amazing experience
7631764 i remember going up the long race there he was sitting in a golf cart the whole team was around the cart and half of them were crying

7631952 the truth is that joe robach is the single biggest barrier to womens health in rochester
7631953 hes taking a page from karl roves playbook and championing a lie robach is consistently anti choice and has stalled on allowing even the most basic measures such as age appropriate sex education from passing the senate

7631980 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the indian courts decision
7631981 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary
7631982 she was there at the door every morning greeting you when you came in

7631987 were getting back to a more average type of production after a couple of years of fairly hot dry conditions in parts of the prairies
7631988 rains have certainly hurt the harvest on the wheat crop in terms of quality rendered probably some of it unsuitable for milling
7631989 the only concerns this year are more on the quality side
7631990 our expectation is that prices will stay up for those commodities a little bit more than for the wheats that have been downgraded to the feed level
7631991 there are many costs in the food chain the biggest thing is what is going to happen to the cost of energy
7631992 even if you do get average crops or slightly above average crops the fundamentals are not going to go away
7631993 the demand for a lot of these commodity grains is going to continue if not grow and the supply is going to either maintain roughly where it is or possibly even shrink
7631994 you have to remember thats only slightly and its still going to be at near record lows in terms of stock to use relationships
7631995 youve seen the input costs go up but not everyone of the processors has passed through the complete input cost increases
7631996 the presence of the international community in afghanistan must be reviewed through a mutual agreement
7631997 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
7631998 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7631999 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7632000 it is one heck of a shame that he johnson was in less danger defending our country in iraq than in a college station bar where he was attacked by a band of thugs
7632001 they finished today in arlington va we lost four in our company when we were down range in our last deployment
7632002 we would go to their police stations and show them how to defend their city against the insurgents
7632003 you know how to make yoghurt but you dont know anything about football
7632004 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
7632005 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
7632006 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
7632007 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
7632008 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
7632009 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
7632010 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
7632011 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
7632012 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
7632013 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
7632014 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
7632015 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7632016 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7632017 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7632018 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7632019 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7632020 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7632021 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7632022 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7632023 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
7632024 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
7632025 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
7632026 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
7632027 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
7632028 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
7632029 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7632030 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7632031 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
7632032 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
7632033 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
7632034 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
7632035 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
7632036 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
7632037 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
7632038 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
7632039 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
7632040 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
7632041 we can look at it as an army command issue
7632042 but it really comes down to a husband and wife issue
7632043 they say if he can do it i can too it happens a lot
7632044 if theres somebody here whos friendly to her and pays attention to her guess what shes real open to an affair
7632045 youve got dummies over there who either dont care or theyre trying to get back at their wives but me man its not worth losing your rank over your moneys your money
7632046 when theyre cheating its up to them to live with it because its eventually going to come out
7632047 theyll blame the deployments and the hardships and such i personally dont buy it
7632048 i know a number of soldiers who have deployed who have not cheated and to turn around and just if thats your excuse its a crutch and its a lie
7632049 i would really be hard pressed to say that infidelity is more prevalent in the military
7632050 i do not think thats an issue i seem to run into it as much in the civilian community as in the military community
7632051 what other business what other organization provides a family support group
7632052 joe cannot afford to deploy and question whats going on at the home front he or she has to concentrate on what the mission is while deployed
7632053 its like we recruit the soldier but we re enlist the family and the family needs to know that being part of the military is not going to be harmful to their marriage
7632054 some are in uniform some are in wedding dresses and suits some are in casual clothes
7632055 we just want to get it knocked out and go celebrate
7632056 and theyre not ready financially and they dont have maturity and they dont have the emotional skills for what it takes to be committed to a marriage
7632057 persons of senior status higher ranking officers and noncommissioned officers
7632058 most of my clients are persons of substance if you will
7632059 if infidelity takes place its because theres brokenness in another part of a persons life
7632060 an affair is just a dimension of a destructive addictive behavior lets get beyond the symptom what is it that is in you thats causing you to risk a great deal and do you have any evidence that this relationship the one you left or the one youve begun has eased the pain within your heart and your soul
7632061 soldiers can compartmentalize tune out the emotion in order to do their jobs effectively
7632062 they are traits that arent necessarily good for a relationship
7632063 its cumulative you can lose sleep one night maybe two but after a while your body shuts down
7632064 the operational tempo of the military is just wearing down the families
7632065 it has a number of adverse effects and one of those adverse effects is affairs
7632066 if theyre willing to work on it not just the affair but the underlying issues
7632067 it will never be like their old marriage but it will be their new normal
7632068 usually when theres a big deployment thats when i get most of my calls i get calls from afghanistan and iraq we get calls from everywhere
7632069 weve had some cases that would totally blow your mind
7632070 if she hadnt joined the army wed still be together
7632071 you cant deal with the flow the numbers are against you
7632072 deshalb steht es ausser frage dass das leben von rettungskr ften zur bergung von leichen riskiert wird
7632073 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could and the fact that hes launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will

7632079 una de las primeras cosas que descubrimos hace nada menos que 400 a os pero como si no es que ni el planeta ni nosotros mismos somos el centro del universo andamos subidos a 250 kil metros por segundo en un planeta de una estrella mediana en la parte exterior de uno de los billones de galaxias existentes y no obstante cu ntas personas siguen crey ndose que son no s lo el centro del universo sino el ombligo del mundo nos ha costado m s todav a una mayor a de los habitantes de la tierra sigue creyendo lo contrario aceptar que es muy dif cil detectar cualquier atisbo de prop sito o intenci n en la historia de la evoluci n en la perspectiva del tiempo geol gico hay otra manera de medir el tiempo somos la ltima gota de la ltima ola del inmenso oc ano c smico ni es seguro que hayamos salido de la era de los artr podos ni est cantado que las bacterias no nos sobrevivan con sus artilugios para medrar en el tiempo y el espacio de momento hay mayor n mero de ellas en nuestra boca que habitantes en nueva york descubriendo por qu somos como somos constatamos que muy probablemente los graznidos fueran la primera muestra de comunicaci n verbal que a ellos sucediera la m sica a sta el lenguaje que o bien era casi innato o bien crec a como un rgano del cuerpo la culminaci n de este proceso fue la escritura que desde hace unos 4 000 a os introdujo el compromiso la se al indeleble de una voluntad que permiti modular la convivencia social pero el an lisis del origen del lenguaje ha permitido matizar que no siempre sirvi para entenderse sino para confundirse y que su impacto es menor que el lenguaje corporal descubrir por qu somos como somos ha sido la primera pista para intentar ser de otra manera para no desaprovechar de manera tan grosera como en el pasado nuestras posibilidades de cambiar tal vez sabiendo por qu tomamos determinadas decisiones no lo sab amos hasta hace muy poco acabaremos tomando otras

7632085 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumour of controversy than the fact of unity
7632086 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so
7632087 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
7632088 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period

7632142 esse boicote n o envolve oposi o ao direito de empregar funcion rios homossexuais nem no modo como eles s o tratados envolve a escolha do mcdonalds de investir seus recursos para promover a agenda homossexual

7632148 heres the problem if fannie mae and freddie mac collapsed then probably the financial system would receive such a body blow that it could be disastrous
7632149 i think long term what we have to do is we have to go ahead and make a decision if these are public entities then maybe they ought to get out of the profit making business
7632150 and if theyre private entities that we dont bail them out

7632156 you should avoid these areas until they are reported as having been cleared
7632157 on august 24 an unexplained explosion near the railway line at skra 10km west of gori destroyed a fuel train you should avoid this rail route for the time being

7632164 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7632165 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7632166 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7632167 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7632168 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7632169 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and we cannot grant full immunity
7632170 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament

7632186 the successful measures by health plans focus on incentives rather than punishment

7632192 i hold marcus in very high esteem and he is a strong character guy miller said
7632193 this has been a horrible situation for marcus and we are in the middle of this horrible process of trying to figure out a best avenue for marcus while we are in that process its incumbent of me to respect that process and his privacy
7632194 we feel that we owe that to him tillman said while acknowledging it was unusual to have a player involved in the process
7632195 we are going to talk again monday and he will have a voice in what we decide we owe that from what he has invested in this club and the community
7632196 that intricate detail on the side of the building it had to be of historical significance

7632202 efforts of the two countries had in the field of cooperation have registered positive progress
7632203 bilateral trade has made relatively big progress that as chinese goods are inexpensive but good in quality and fits the consuming level of the cameroonian people cameroon is expected to import more goods from china so as to achieve greater progress with striking positive balance in bilateral trade
7632204 selfless assistance by the chinese government over the past years and hopes to expand such friendly cooperation in all areas
7632205 chinas cooperation and investment in africa cannot be labelled as
7632206 we african people welcome chinese goods because they are both affordable and reliable we hope more small and medium sized chinese enterprises come to invest in cameroon so that more people can be benefited that such cooperation will not only bring the investment but also technical expertise so that african people can learn to rely on themselves eventually
7632207 taken unawares as chinese traders flooded the streets with what they call
7632208 we used to buy goods from nigeria ghana and other african countries that produce solid goods but now the business seems to be falling since most of our customers rush for the cheaper goods
7632209 chinese products are very unreliable and risky when it comes to electrical appliances this poses a threat to technicians
7632210 i think the cameroon government should invest in the local production industry or better still lay complaints to the chinese government for them to improve on the quality of these goods even if it means increasing the prices

7632214 we are investigating an incident that took place in cardiff street last night where a number of males were fighting
7632215 so far we have made four arrests and those people have been detained at peterlee police office

7632222 it will be tough to put a team like this back together

7632224 the ioc in 2001 reached the conclusions that the focus must be much more on sustainability that big is not necessarily better
7632225 we have been dazzled we have been impressed we have been blown away by these beijing games but we have not been intimidated and in our own sweet way without wasting tax payers money i am convinced that we can do just as well in 2012
7632226 clearly they have chosen the path of arrogance unilateralism thats a serious blow to confidence building in the talks
7632227 we are not going to allow the election to go ahead without our members even a single one we will not allow them to rig this process
7632228 according to updated information 68 passengers were killed including 24 kyrgyz five iranians one turkish national three canadians three kazakhs and one chinese

7632232 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7632233 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7632234 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7632235 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7632236 the acquisition of pbs will help ensure that severstal controls its operating costs by providing a guaranteed supply of metallurgical coal for our coke making operations in the u s
7632237 its a good acquisition in that it allows severstal to supply the needs of its north american assets
7632238 production of coking coal can be expected to double in the medium term
7632239 the acquisition looks a bit expensive compared with russian coking coal producers but compared with north american coals its a bit cheaper
7632240 we realize that a lot of people are really busy on the ldi show floor
7632241 so this year we came up with new options of purchasing sessions in our conference program a six pack and twelve pack of sessions to offer more flexibility and make the conference realistic for more people to attend both in terms of time and affordability
7632242 you can pick from a wide variety of different sessions
7632243 my goal is to have at least 1000 people out of the more than 13 000 at the show pick up on these options and at least buy a six pack
7632244 what most people see is that if the muslims are here surely there is no temple

7632247 the university has dismissed bill shanahan as an assistant professor in our communications program and as head coach of our debate program for violation of the universitys faculty code of ethics
7632248 its just a known fact that policy debate is evolving

7632253 ive rested since may 29th after our loss against lakers i havent played a game for two and a half months the spurs have given to me a program for this summer that ive strictly followed mainly lifting weights and shooting so i dont have a concern about my current shape
7632254 oo i want to look like everybody else i cant bare thinking about it if im the only one not wearing the new coat trousers top
7632255 our main concern here is that we invest in the employees and make all the employees aware of the risk factors they have
7632256 there are a lot of us that have health problems thats causing us to be overweight its not something that weve just decided to become fat
7632257 i think its a good idea actually it helps people keep their weight down and it helps keep them in shape
7632258 were simply trying to help individuals find the risks that they have then provide the means for them to go do something about it

7632262 un ex presidente argentino duhalde fue propuesto por brasil como director de la representaci n permanente del grupo regional y despu s dicho pa s acept la propuesta argentina de que fuera un ex vicepresidente chacho lvarez quien lo reemplazara
7632263 por esta raz n el gobierno argentino no presionar para obtener esta posici n y brasil tampoco lo har con lo cual es muy poco probable que finalmente kirchner sea elegido para esta funci n
7632264 los pa ses de la orbita bolivariana prefieren a kirchner m s por razones ideol gicas que regionales brasil al elegir el primer presidente pro tempore del grupo eligi a bachelet quien ejerce hoy esta funci n hasta fin de a o
7632265 la posible designaci n del ex presidente n stor kirchner a la secretaria general de unasur podr a tener diversos efectos tanto a nivel sudamericano como a nivel interno
7632266 esta inminente designaci n fue apoyada por la mayor a de los pa ses de sudam rica en especial venezuela bolivia brasil ecuador paraguay y uruguay
7632267 este ltimo punto es de especial relevancia debido a los intentos de venezuela brasil y argentina por contener una extensi n de la influencia pol tico estrat gica de norteam rica tanto en la zona andina como en el cono sur
7632268 en la institucionalidad actual del mercosur que siempre se fue muy cuidadoso en que no creciera hay rganos decisorios que son los creados por el protocolo de ouro preto subgrupos de trabajo que colaboran con el grupo de mercado com n en su tareas y comit s t cnicos
7632269 se empezaron a crear reuniones especializadas en varios espacios reuni n especializada de la mujer reuni n de la juventud de agricultura familiar turismo de las cooperativas de cine y las audiovisuales etc
7632270 institutos del mercosur que tienen determinadas autonom as sedes en diversos lugares propuestas de estructura de personal presupuestos en decenas de miles de d lares etc y que adem s no tienen funciones claras los diversos institutos est n planteados con presupuestos de hasta 300 000 d lares
7632271 estas propuestas contradicen aquella primera definici n de no crear una burocracia del mercosur lo cual se cumple en el caso de la secretar a administrativa con sede en montevideo que solamente tiene 24 funcionarios para apoyar todo el andamiaje del bloque
7632272 gente formada ya que tenemos un d ficit de burocracia para llevar a la pr ctica las decisiones que tomamos
7632273 los argentinos y brasile os se repartieron todos los cargos
7632274 somos como grandes jarrones chinos en apartamentos peque os no se retiran del mobiliario porque se supone que son valiosos pero est n todo el rato estorbando
7632275 el gran problema de la argentina y de este gobierno es encontrarle un trabajo a kirchner
7632276 todos nos dicen qu valioso y qu importante es este jarr n pero nadie sabe d nde ponerlo
7632277 ayudar a a descomprimir la compleja situaci n que vive de cara a la actual administraci n
7632278 los pa ses de la orbita bolivariana prefieren a kirchner m s por razones ideol gicas que regionales
7632279 they are trying to tie me as browders lawyer to the extortion of 232 million from the state budget
7632280 the flow of oil began this weekend and the pipeline reopened today
7632281 were shocked by the magnitude of the numbers especially given that the company revised its investment plans only a month ago troika dialog analysts oleg maximov valery nesterov and alex fak wrote in a note to investors friday
7632282 this raises questions about whether the management actually intends to generate any meaningful free cash flow
7632283 limits the likelihood of the company returning value to the shareholders in the short term
7632284 we expect 50 premieres while we only had 22 of them in 2006
7632285 some of the cars are designed specially for the russian market like the mazda kazamai which is due to be unveiled at our show for the first time in the world
7632286 this is the first time that such a car show has been held in russia
7632287 what we have seen during a 30 minute tour of the plant is really a miracle
7632288 being 100 percent automatic the production technology makes it impossible to add ingredients like dried milk to the tanks
7632289 thirty farms in the leningrad oblast are prepared to work with gatchina the galaktika plant as the plant will offer higher wholesale pricing
7632290 we are at the beginning by launching a large and modern plant we have accomplished a minor goal
7632291 as soon as there are reports on the production efficiency we will consider whether or not to expand
7632292 the administration has ordered the citys construction committee to announce another tender for a new contractor with a new budget and approval from the main state expert body before the end of the year
7632293 the city is not able to finance the whole project now we are holding negotiations to have gazprom co finance no less than 50 percent of the project i even think that gazprom should cover even more than 50 percent
7632294 depending on the nature of the deal he may try to block it
7632295 there has been an abuse of power by the state labor inspectorate
7632296 when there is a developing corporate conflict between the russian and foreign shareholders over a short period of time
7632297 all the checks that took place at the firm were done by the law
7632298 but russias like a prize fighter whos been knocked down yet will get back up and beat the count
7632299 at that time its very important that the investment case for russia is there
7632300 any bad news in the next couple of weeks would add fuel to the funeral pyre of investment sentiment
7632301 take more than the passage of time and the usual september rally
7632302 until relations improve between russia and the west significant progress is made on legal reform yields drop globally or major pension reforms are enacted
7632303 but there was not even a catheter to carry oxygen from the pillow to the babys lungs do you think i am a magician
7632304 patients are often asked to bring everything from cups to syringes with them when they are checked into the hospital
7632305 this list is meager and needs to be updated so doctors do not have much to chose from
7632306 the total contribution of alcohol to overall mortality is roughly 50 percent
7632307 it has created somewhat better conditions for providing medical aid but there is huge work ahead here
7632308 this situation is not unique many of the regions are incapable of making good use of the federal aid
7632309 this system is not effective and not transparent and it is also costing more money
7632310 maybe we need to look again at the state health care model which we once brushed aside not in order to return to the old soviet system but to return to state funding and control
7632311 public health should be an area of state responsibility in a country like russia
7632312 this would promote competition in the medical industry and develop the medical institutions properly
7632313 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7632314 this is what is going to happen now georgia is going to accelerate its march toward nato and i hope to an action plan in december
7632315 russia has shown exactly why georgia needs to be in nato russia did not lift a finger against the baltic states once they entered nato it would not lift a finger against ukraine if ukraine were in nato the same goes for georgia
7632316 we need georgia and ukraine in nato to deter these kinds of tragic military adventures on the part of russia when it feels it has some room to potentially block the accession of these countries to nato

7632328 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again

7632330 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof from the fateful day of our lunch tell tale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge

7632360 apabila tahap kalium naik terlampau tinggi antara tandanya ialah rasa lemah otot sakit dada serta palpitasi jantung dengan jantung berdenyut secara cepat dan tidak normal
7632361 bagi masyarakat melayu mereka suka makan ulam seperti petai dan pelbagai jenis pucuk seperti pucuk paku pucuk ubi daun selom ulam raja dan juga sayuran hijau yang lain tapi ini semua mengandungi tahap kalium yang tinggi
7632362 begitu juga buah buahan tropika seperti pisang limau dan oren buah kiwi papaya durian serta tembikai susu juga air buah seperti air kelapa dan jus prun
7632363 bagi yang mengalami kerosakan buah pinggang anda perlu mengurangkan pengambilan sayur seperti bayam kangkung dan sawi
7632364 elak atau kurangkan makan aiskrim makanan serta minuman dalam tin dadih susu coklat dan juga bahan gantian garam kerana semua ini tinggi kandungan kaliumnya
7632365 resin seperti sodium polystyrene sulphonate atau kayexalate boleh diambil resin akan bergabung dengan kalium dalam intestin dan kalium yang lebih itu akan dikeluarkan dari badan melalui najis
7632366 sesungguhnya sesiapa yang telah makan batal puasa hendaklah ia berpuasa baki waktu harinya itu
7632367 dan ketika waktu waktu bersahur itu mereka meminta ampun dan beristighfar
7632368 jadikanlah solat sunat witir sebagai solat kamu yang terakhir dalam satu malam
7632369 tiga golongan yang tidak di tolak doa mereka pemimpin yang adil individu berpuasa sehingga berbuka dan doa orang yang di zalimi
7632370 sesungguhnya bagi orang berpuasa itu ketika berbuka atau hampir berbuka doa yang tidak akan ditolak
7632371 last night on the eve of the democratic national convention we trashed the democratic party headquarters in asheville nc
7632372 it has been an extremely difficult decision to take given my burning desire to represent europe again in defending the ryder cup in the united states
7632373 the fact that boston this week is my only opportunity to qualify for the final two play off events as well as being my final opportunity to play my 15 events on the us pga tour conflicts with my ambition to play gleneagles and earn my spot in the team
7632374 i have called nick faldo and told him of my decision and hope that my performance so far this year will earn one of his two wild card picks
7632375 the captains picks are a nightmare and not a position i would have wanted but we know that nick will do the right thing
7632376 working with orson was like having a private 12 month film course with orson welles as the teacher
7632377 we would have long chats about film and his experiences in the golden days of hollywood the first thing i ever asked orson was how he got such good performances out of his actors
7632378 i had a lot of encouragements from my parents so i hung unto the game while paying attention to my studies i fully engaged in my tennis career in 2001 when i played the under 14 national tournament and won my first medal
7632379 it was my first competition out of cameroon and we came back with a lot of medals gold silver and bronze in various categories
7632380 i wish i could have a scholarship one day so that i can be able to exploit my talents
7632381 settle your problems with others or with yourself when there is still time because it is deplorable in there
7632382 you dont know when they will bring the food and it is usually just once
7632383 in view of the socio economic importance that the bridge will offer the villages will benefit as their farm produce will easily be transported to the markets we are bent on realising this bridge which will also go along way to curb the numerous cases of people drowning in this river every year
7632384 i dont know what came to my mind i did it because i have become desperate since my parents disowned me
7632385 before coming to church this morning i spent the night out in the open at the down beach so i was just trying to see how i could raise money maybe to go back
7632386 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7632387 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7632388 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7632389 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7632390 the situation needs to be resolved since we cant have those type of negotiations to resolve this amicably we have to take the city to court
7632391 if you the mall merchants continue with the unprofessionalism and badgering its not going to move forward
7632392 we had identified the issues to be discussed and we had a timeframe this is very simple if we want to resolve this issue we can if not thats up to you i will not engage in this public hysteria
7632393 the importance for merchants to perhaps not be so vocal
7632394 our overall advice to candidates has been to stay home
7632395 not to separate themselves from the democratic party but because thats where their constituents are you dont find your constituents in denver and these are important days
7632396 our goal is to democratize democracy myspace is the leading forum for engaging in discussions of ideas and culture so its important that we have a strong presence at both conventions
7632397 this is where leaders of government business and citizens all come together and our unique platform provides an ideal setting for all of these groups to connect
7632398 we dont like it but we cant do anything about it
7632399 este um grande passo para distanciar a empresa da amd
7632400 ainda n o sabemos quanto de energia os chips consomem e como o calor ser dissipado estas s o as principais preocupa es

7632402 we look forward to another orange cameroun sponsored inter quarter football competition come july 2009
7632403 oh i get it the fork is the dinglehopper from the movie
7632404 bitch dont make me go ghetto on you with my dinglehopper i am real like that
7632405 victor dont make any sudden movement but look over there
7632406 were getting back to a more average type of production after a couple of years of fairly hot dry conditions in parts of the prairies
7632407 rains have certainly hurt the harvest on the wheat crop in terms of quality rendered probably some of it unsuitable for milling
7632408 the only concerns this year are more on the quality side
7632409 our expectation is that prices will stay up for those commodities a little bit more than for the wheats that have been downgraded to the feed level
7632410 there are many costs in the food chain the biggest thing is what is going to happen to the cost of energy
7632411 even if you do get average crops or slightly above average crops the fundamentals are not going to go away
7632412 the demand for a lot of these commodity grains is going to continue if not grow and the supply is going to either maintain roughly where it is or possibly even shrink
7632413 you have to remember thats only slightly and its still going to be at near record lows in terms of stock to use relationships
7632414 youve seen the input costs go up but not everyone of the processors has passed through the complete input cost increases
7632415 we want to make sure people know exactly who senator obama is and where he wants to take the country and two that voters know their choice in this election
7632416 price advertises opportunity time regulates opportunity and volume measures the success or failure of the auction process
7632417 knowing her nose better than anyone else i was in a unique position to take care of the problem
7632418 im going to dance while im there im going to dance in the aisle
7632419 ill crash a party if theyre having a good one
7632420 its a history making event whatever happens in november you can always say you were there
7632421 a convention is no more than a big pep rally its to get us all fired up and geared up to do the job what we need to do to get our candidate elected
7632422 my mother told me never to walk out on anybodys speech so i stayed
7632423 im a hillary delegate but im 200 percent for barack
7632424 ive been a big supporter major supporter of unions virtually all my life
7632425 all statistics indicate for the last 35 years is that the main salary for the union worker has remained stagnant we have to talk about issues around living wage issues about heath care and issues about pension and retirement and unions have been the most avid advocates for those issues and thats why i support any union
7632426 i lived in the projects of san francisco for the first 11 years of my life i had a health care system because my parents worked at the post office
7632427 they took our pensions it wasnt right so were trying to find somebody to take their place to help us win the fight for the working people
7632428 i am still tooling around with my speech a little bit
7632429 it may not be as good as the headliners of the other three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice that the american people are going to face in november
7632430 he can clear his thoughts and write without the distractions of home
7632431 the return of these doctors is a positive thing because we are suffering from a severe shortage of personnel and we welcome doctors willing to their country
7632432 its just simpler and more streamlined to absorb the executive committees powers into the nominating and governance committee
7632433 the need for and use of executive committees has fallen off sharply
7632434 power and influence have flowed to the three independent committees audit compensation and nominating
7632435 pandit is continuing to exercise his increased authority over the future of business
7632436 sandy weill brought in rubin and prince kept him as a consigliere it looks like dick parsons is moving to the fore
7632437 under a gorgeous sky dave said that he and the band were having a tough week after the death last week of sax player leroi moore but added
7632438 surprised by how much smaller and more intimate the place looks in real life compared to tv but i was very pleased to see virginia for the first time in a long time has a prominent spot on the floor of the convention hall highlighting its prominence this election cycle
7632439 han aparecido situaciones personales como la que ha manifestado el presidente provincial de que ahora l esta con el si a nivel del guayas cosa que nosotros como bases y como educadores no estamos de acuerdo
7632440 nosotros rechazamos esto y exigimos que se respete la decisi n nacional adoptada por el partido que es el voto nulo
7632441 la se ora pierina correa manifiesta que el guayas con la id respaldan al si nosotros estuvimos en d as pasados una convenci n donde ustedes fueron testigos que el partido se reuni y decidi en el cuerpo ejecutivo estar por el voto nulo
7632442 i will tell you having visited israel just a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7632443 my job as president would be to try to make sure we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that we mobilize the world community to go after irans nuclear program in a serious way we have to do it before israel feels its back is against the wall
7632444 this item is distinct and is seen being carried and used by the thief on july 12th

7632450 gt here are pennystockers who practice the specific or some variant of the strategies i detail in my and michael gooooooooode clocking in at 15
7632451 and i think what you will conclude is gee he is sort of like us
7632452 he is still not that well known in parts of the country
7632453 and because he has been caricatured by the other republican side his speech is probably more important than most acceptance speeches are
7632454 what obama is hoping for out of this week is a redefinition of himself and his campaign that is lasting and that is appealing to the american people
7632455 im not feeling very good a little mexico y i need a gatorade could you get me one please

7632465 is it worth the time and money required to provide sexual harassment awareness training to county employees and elected officials
7632466 why not release the videos and let the people see what took place
7632467 we found independent witnesses that dont support the allegations that any racial comments were made
7632468 when the white people pass the van they just go naturally when william and nathaniel pass the van their heads immediately snap towards the van in unison
7632469 what would have been said to cause both of them to react the same way
7632470 inappropriate things that were said and done in relation to the black community by a former commander
7632471 russias parliament has backed a motion urging the president to recognise the independence of georgias breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia
7632472 the us said any move to recognise independence of the two regions would be contrary to international law ummmm the us invasion amp occupation of iraq was
7632473 russia and georgia fought a brief war this month over the two provinces
7632474 russia fought a brief war after georgia tried to retake south ossetia by force
7632475 i was elected by the people of my district to represent them at this convention im not off the campaign trail im just not in brooklyn
7632476 go to minneapolis theyll probably be there as opposed to somewhere where real democrats are meeting
7632477 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys who has to step up and take advantage of it
7632478 im more concerned with the team that we have right here in our locker room and that this team mentally prepares itself as best we can
7632479 as always well continue to research all of our options
7632480 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7632481 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7632482 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7632483 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7632484 it makes you feel more attractive youre turning on a guy and he thinks its cool
7632485 immediately after guys come up and are like do you want to do that with me its a quick fix to get a guys attention
7632486 het was heel moeilijk voor me om niet aan de spelen te denken
7632487 ik probeerde gisteravond op tijd te gaan slapen maar het lukte niet
7632488 ik wilde de sluitingsceremonie in peking bekijken in mijn gedachten ben ik nog steeds daar
7632489 als je in rusland mensen op straat vraagt wat een grandslamtoernooi is blijven velen je het antwoord schuldig maar als je vraagt wat de olympische spelen zijn kan iedereen je het antwoord geven het is het grootste toernooi ter wereld soms kan ik nog niet geloven dat ik goud gewonnen heb
7632490 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7632491 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
7632492 the funds werent here to buy today they were here to take profits
7632493 the markets having a difficult time rationalizing current prices on these demand levels
7632494 localized rains could be pretty decent but overall this looks to be more of a scattered thunderstorm event where the places that get good rains are far outnumbered by the areas that get very little
7632495 we are to the point in the year where the benefits of rainfall on the corn and soybean crops start to be limited
7632496 sfc is on a firm footing now it needs to consolidate further as it goes along hopefully it will control a nuclear triad in the near future its good that an army officer has been named as its chief all three services need to get the nuclear experience
7632497 iaf says it does not have enough assets at present instead it itself maintains some dual tasked fighters jury rigged to deliver nuclear weapons the sfc should ideally have at least half a squadron of dedicated bombers

7632504 javascript being a single threaded language makes extensive use of event driven programming to enable responsive web applica tions however standard approaches to sequencing events are messy and often lead to code that is dif cult to understand and maintain we have found that arrows a generalization of monads are an elegant solution to this problem
7632505 our findings have important implications for both education and social policy
7632506 first they suggest that policies that change a childs exposure to classmates from troubled families will have important consequences for his or her education outcomes in addition the results also help provide a more complete measure of the social costs of family conflict
7632507 there are many reasons for disruptive classroom behavior domestic violence is one particularly good indicator of a troubled child
7632508 the dollar wants to pull oil lower and the storm wants to pull it higher it s a bit of a tug of war right now
7632509 from the caribbean to the caspian we ve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7632510 it certainly doesn t bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7632511 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7632512 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7632513 someone once told me you cant have it all but i say thats entirely up to you
7632514 well you can say that im the one curly fry in the box of the regular
7632515 so if you havent heard the word the rep is bursting with new energy
7632516 it promises to help make kansas city a source of theatrical innovation for the rest of the country to follow
7632517 we think our approach to all our marketing is going to be really different
7632518 weve got cool plans to release micro pages and web sites about specific shows
7632519 were not doing a very good job of reaching people who arent already going to the theater
7632520 we want to try to catch em off guard and get em to think maybe ive been missing out on live theater amp 61486
7632521 well be doing things that we think will appeal to a younger audience without alienating our longtime subscribers
7632522 so if you havent heard the word the rep is bursting with new energy

7632529 they just missed me but hit the two trucks behind
7632530 this road used to be safe but in the last month theyve been attacking more and more
7632531 if the afghan army isnt there a fly cannot pass
7632532 the talebans trying to cut the main roads to kabul to target supplies for foreign forces just like the mujahidin did with the soviets if the highways are cut even for two days it could also create riots in the city
7632533 he also says that the moolahs have been to all the villages and laid the people under ban not to assist the english and that consequently the mussulman population are as one man against us
7632534 the taleban will surround kabul politically and militarily to make it hard for nato forces to receive logistic convoys
7632535 that will mean less nato movement and will show we can make trouble in the capital
7632536 in no sense have they created or can they make a strategic threat to the government of afghanistan
7632537 were fine for fuel and food with the air power we have and the quality of troops on the ground there is no way they can win
7632538 they used to warn us not to supply the infidel
7632539 if they catch me now theyll throw me in my own container cover me in petrol and burn me alive
7632540 temas como aborto fam lia educa o e liberdade religiosa os bispos do equador decidiram discutir estes pontos com base nos pronunciamentos do papa bento 16
7632541 well you can say that im the one curly fry in the box of the regular
7632542 miembros del ej rcito nacional llevaban a cabo ejecuciones extrajudiciales y arbitrarias de personas presunta o verdaderamente vinculadas a los grupos guerrilleros y que para tal prop sito contaban con el apoyo de grupos paramilitares patrocinados y dirigidos
7632543 donde se reun a con ste haciendo alarde de que ten a que exterminar a los guerrilleros que hab a en la sonora
7632544 relato escabroso en donde se describe la forma en que se secuestraba y torturaba a muchas de las infortunadas v ctimas la manera en que se descuartizaban sus cuerpos y c mo sus restos eran arrojados a las aguas del r o cauca en el valle del cauca para que desaparecieran y no dejar rastro de los homicidios ejecutados por el grupo bajo sus rdenes
7632545 yo s que mi declaraci n va a dar problemas
7632546 the harper government cut loose a contentious private members bill that would have made it a crime to take the life of a fetus just as election speculation hits fever pitch
7632547 weve heard criticism from across the country including representatives of the medical community that mr epps bill as presently drafted could be interpreted as instilling fetal rights let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7632548 for this reason im announcing that the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but do so in a way that leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights
7632549 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7632550 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7632551 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
7632552 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7632553 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7632554 maybe illustrates how difficult it can be when you have food allergies to stay on top of that information
7632555 after 12 weeks the whole body vibration group weighed less showed no changes in lean muscle mass and had a lower overall percentage of body fat than the age matched non vibration group
7632556 over the course of the study the vibrated rats were healthy tolerated the vibration well and exhibited no obvious signs of distress following adaptation to vibration
7632557 vibration training has been shown to improve strength and balance in older women
7632558 vibration training may give you the same results as a moderate intensity workout
7632559 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7632560 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7632561 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7632562 this finding means that it is possible to offer simple non invasive screening for patients with a family history of neuroblastoma
7632563 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile
7632564 its an advantage to be able to start with agents that have already been shown to be safe in adults
7632565 together with this current study we are defining the genetic events that underlie this childhood cancer
7632566 better understanding of these biological pathways will guide our efforts to develop more effective treatments
7632567 not only is compound 1080 one of the most concentrated deadly poisons on earth with no known antidote it is also horrifically cruel causing a long agonizing death
7632568 in early may 2003 a sensitive source gave coalition forces a box of chemicals he claimed the iis m16 preparation division was researching the chemicals were meant for assassinations or to assist in kidnapping
7632569 clearly this local business owner simply wanted to support the american security pacs goals which are to help support congressional candidates who believe in a strong national defense
7632570 but i have never spoken to him about the pending bill or about compound 1080
7632571 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7632572 he should have called bill clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7632573 para todos nossos familiares e amigos temos o prazer de anunciar que nossa princesinha anja louise ambr sio mazur nasceu ela pesa 3 kg e absolutamente perfeita

7632575 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
7632576 wanting to protect the rights and benefits of floridians or keep government out of our lives isnt partisan
7632577 people are not about to take a hydrogen car seriously until it gets treated like a real car
7632578 wormwood is really just me having fun and trying to throw in as many disgusting perversions of my old childhood influences i call it my riff on doctor who if it were more demonologically oriented and written for very juvenile adults with a sick sense of humor
7632579 lenz who four years ago created a textbook example of how to lose a perfectly winnable election did one thing extremely well during the marsh campaign he chased out the door numerous people with strong talent and desire to help us i am not referring exclusively to one incident in particular but rather a steady string of volunteers who came into the campaign office eager and able to help and left jaded and turned off i would even count myself among people who came off that debacle feeling used abused under appreciated and in no hurry to get back into politics anytime soon observing lenzs behavior in many of these instances i came to suspect that he would rather lose an election than win without getting full credit for it
7632580 he would rather lose an election than win without getting full credit for it
7632581 is it a dead possum a raccoon a dog or could it possibly be a distant relative of the gulp montauk monster
7632582 it seems to be a common technique of his doesnt it
7632583 ive only seen the footage once during the game i couldnt really remember much when he contacted me i sort of thought well hes hit me with the head but i thought the attempt might have been legitimate
7632584 it sort of glanced off me it wasnt the full impact
7632585 the first time he went at me i could see him coming at me and the second time i sort of backed away after referee lyndon bray told me to release the ball from the ruck and luckily for me i did because it sort of just glanced me but i wouldnt have liked to cop the full brunt
7632586 id have to say its probably the most enjoyable test that ive been involved in
7632587 i suppose looking back i wasnt expecting to be a part of this squad and to get a start against the springboks such a proud nation at probably what is my favourite stadium to play at at kings park absa stadium it was just a real honour and wins are at a premium over here
7632588 i have to manage it pretty well these days given my age

7632603 mickey was suddenly underqualified to make decisions about real estate cash flows debt levels and employment problems
7632604 i kept thinking weve got to fix it the press and the stock market were killing us
7632605 mickey wasnt so passionate about compensation committees and budgets and strategic plans
7632606 we knew the company couldnt continue to operate with a master merchant driving the brand my own view was that there should be a transition to a more management oriented ceo
7632607 mickey was given 99 percent of the credit but don had started the company and maybe he felt he deserved more credit than he was getting

7632620 ive already won a stage on the tour de france 2006 and have been french champion 2005 the win at plouay is like a bronze medal in my list of achievements
7632621 ive not totally recovered from the jetlag i still have some worries over my sleep levels

7632624 between the reds and the wallabies thats my first win over here
7632625 i suppose its not something that im that happy about but its good to break it
7632626 ive had a couple of draws over here but never a win so i just sort of had goose bumps there for the last few minutes of the game when we realised that wed won it
7632627 i know every other time ive come over weve said how hard it is to play here and how not many teams win here
7632628 we never mentioned that at all this week we just focused on our own preparation and i think that was a pretty big factor in getting a result
7632629 we sort of had balance between our training and the guys getting away from rugby as well on their days off
7632630 robbie mentioned it in the change rooms that he was really happy how the boys used their downtime throughout the week to get out there and enjoy the place and really use it as a tour as opposed to a chore which i think a lot of teams that come here sort of think
7632631 i think once you get over that thing of playing in south africa and now the guys have felt what its like to win here then i think that could be pretty important for the group
7632632 weve already discussed that straight away in the change rooms
7632633 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7632634 i imagine nothing would keep him away from a democratic convention
7632635 tonight will be an opportunity for the american people to be introduced to senator obama once again to learn about his values from people who know him best
7632636 the story of barack obama is firmly rooted in the american tradition
7632637 i am asking you to those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me during the primary
7632638 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are gonna do
7632639 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
7632640 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7632641 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president
7632642 the postponement of champions trophy is a body blow to pakistan but since the country is run by wrong people i see more trouble for cricket in the country
7632643 the event is postponed until next year but if the current government trying to outdo musharraf stays i fear the situation could worsen rather than improve
7632644 it is not that we should not fight terrorism but the way musharraf led us into the war on terror by using gunship helicopters against our own people was fatal because as a blow back peace the economy and cricket have become casualties
7632645 under the situation when foreign investors are not willing to come to pakistan how can you expect foreign cricketers to travel to a country where we are fighting someone elses war
7632646 the way the outgoing chairman of the pakistan cricket board nasim ashraf spent funds for two years and now with the postponement of series after series pakistan cricket will soon run short of money
7632647 not just from the spectators point of view but also funds wise these cancellations and postponement have hit pakistan cricket hard but i fear it will suffer more

7632651 tonight will be an opportunity for the american people to be introduced to senator obama once again to learn about his values from people who know him best
7632652 the story of barack obama is firmly rooted in the american tradition
7632653 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumour of controversy than the fact of unity
7632654 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
7632655 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7632656 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7632657 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7632658 this situation forced us to withdraw our support and sit on opposition benches
7632659 continue struggle for restoration of judges and genuine democracy in pakistan
7632660 we have requested saeed uz zaman siddiqui to accept our offer to become presidential candidate
7632661 he is a good pakistani who is a non partisan person
7632662 the ppp even nominated zardari for president and announced the election schedule without consulting our party
7632663 the ppp also violated the latest agreement that the judges will be restored 24 hours after the resignation of musharraf
7632664 i think he could have sent a signal to say i want this tamped down
7632665 the demand is over the top youve never seen anything like this
7632666 its only for the best of the best that we host here
7632667 many of the new rules also apply to the national nominating conventions though the public would not know this by looking at the roster of parties being planned by lobbyists and lobbying organizations
7632668 i respect the position thats been taken by the senator but i dont necessarily agree with it
7632669 so barack obama who says that he doesnt want to have any lobbyist money in his campaign is having a lobbyist bundle money from large corporations many of which are clients for the convention thats going to nominate obama
7632670 were right back to the pre watergate era right now
7632671 this whole federal election campaign law was developed because in 1972 the nixon administration had set up a slush fund through the 1972 republican national convention
7632672 this late primary also impacted the host committees ability to raise funds we have been supportive of the host committees work to fund the convention and have encouraged those who support us to support their efforts
7632673 significantly change the way conventions are funded in the future should he be elected
7632674 barack obama is committed to reforming our political system and getting the special interests out of politics
7632675 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7632676 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal
7632677 russias historic role of the guarantor of peace in the caucasus has increased
7632678 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7632679 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7632680 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods

7632695 si los directivos de pcp no firman el convenio por la deuda de 500 mil pesos que mantienen el 1 de septiembre le cortaremos la luz
7632696 si antes del 31 de agosto los actuales arrendatarios de la ex empresa celul sica benfide no firman el convenio de pago por la deuda que mantienen el 1 de septiembre le bajaremos la llave de la energ a es decir que reduciremos la potencia porque no queremos dejar sin este servicio a las escuelas y de agua potable a la localidad ya que las bombas de agua est n dentro de la planta
7632697 la deuda solamente de capital alcanza los 500 mil pesos tenemos una reglamentaci n que la gente de pcp la conoce que especifica que cuando hay una transferencia o sucesi n de empresas para la reconexi n energ tica de un punto cualquiera se deben cancelar las deudas preexistentes
7632698 si bien la deuda es de benfide nosotros no hemos tenido ni siquiera un cambio de empresa porque pcp no nos present ni un s lo papel y por eso para nosotros la que sigue tomando la energ a es benfide aunque sabemos que la que administra la f brica es pcp con lo cual la cooperativa entendiendo de que hab a una per odo muy largo de cese laboral que hab a que dar los primeros pasos para reconectar y reiniciar las actividades hemos acordado prestar servicios hasta el 31 de agosto porque no podemos seguir sosteniendo esta situaci n porque la cooperativa tiene un proceso muy serio de endeudamiento y de emergencia econ mica por lo cual necesitamos por lo menos una muestra de voluntad de pago para que podamos proseguir proveyendo de energ a a la planta
7632699 diez pagos a partir de enero de 2009 pero hasta el momento no lo quisieron asumir vienen se firma el convenio de pago y se termina el fantasma del corte

7632701 entendemos que presentar n la documentaci n que corresponde para que se hagan cargo los empresarios locales de lo contrario tendremos que seguir factur ndole a benfide

7632732 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
7632733 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7632752 cynthia mckinney deserves a place in the new orleans debate any presidential candidate who has qualified for enough ballot lines to achieve the necessary electoral votes to win to be elected regardless of poll numbers has earned a place in the debates the 15 threshold is being used to exclude all candidates outside of the corporate party nominees john mccain and barack obama
7632753 ms mckinney is more than just the candidate of a viable and growing party she has played a special role in the movement to help survivors of the 2005 hurricane disaster in new orleans and the gulf coast region no other presidential candidate can talk about the needs of those whove been displaced or otherwise affected by katrina the way ms mckinney can their concerns will be missing from the debate if cynthia mckinney isnt invited
7632754 voters deserve to know about all the names theyll see on the ballot on election day and to know which candidate best represents ones interests and ideals its time to end debates limited to candidates approved by sponsoring corporations and pollsters
7632755 how can any progressive look themselves in the mirror after the election if mccain wins and they have not devoted at least some time to the obama campaign

7632767 its weird how things work coming right into the season and having two of the three guys battling different ailments
7632768 but we still have a couple weeks before we really need to go
7632769 its a unique situation we have here we have three guys three young guys that are battling for a position that will determine how far we will go in this season
7632770 all three of them are still in the bag right now and i guess after this game well empty the bag and see who is the starting quarterback
7632771 we need to look at troy i dont think thats changed from last week
7632772 kyle is still viable in the mix hes had really good practices all through training camp wed like to play him also in the game
7632773 i dont know what theyre thinking all i know is i have to prepare myself as a starter go out there every day in practice and try to get better
7632774 i think hes in the mix because we have two quarterbacks that arent able to practice today so joes going to take all the reps
7632775 but the big picture hasnt changed dramatically in the sense that hes still a rookie and weve got two guys that were ahead of him before we came into this situation right before the st louis game
7632776 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds today in the 1970s maybe it was
7632777 when the taliban fell and i decided to come back to afghanistan some of my family was not happy with me
7632778 my three sons even did not come back with me but my wife and daughter did and we now live and work in kabul
7632779 when we heard from the ministry of education in kabul that they desperately needed land for a school my wife encouraged me to give this land here for a girls school
7632780 she had to move away from panjshir to get an education and she didnt want the girls today to have to do the same thing
7632781 it is a good thing that his family was willing to give their personal land for a girls school because good useable land is getting very hard to find here in panjshir
7632782 when i decided to come back to afghanistan a good friend of mine from holland asked me why i would want to leave the netherlands for afghanistan
7632783 i told him that i was sure that as long as coalition forces were here helping our government then i knew it would be a good safe place to come
7632784 i am very happy that i made the decision to come back to afghanistan because i can do something for the people here for my people
7632785 i was in the office during physical training hours about as often or more as i was outside doing pt during those hours
7632786 there were several factors like overall health and wanting to look and feel better
7632787 i wanted the flag gone before the board convened and i wanted to be underweight by a solid margin and not just making it
7632788 i started with a diet that was high protein low fat low carb and eating six to eight times a day
7632789 i run four days per week and do a combination of abs and muscular strength training three days per week on the days i dont run
7632790 in the next month or so i will register for the country music marathon in nashville
7632791 as it turns out this race will be on my birthday in april 2009 that will almost certainly be my first official marathon at this point i cant possibly imagine it will be my last
7632792 my wife and i are both trying to alter our lifestyles to be much more aware of our health
7632793 it isnt quite time for my over 40 physical but im not getting any younger either
7632794 my teenage girls kept saying dad got hot and i cant believe you are wearing teenager clothes
7632795 of course my wife said we need to go shopping
7632796 it shows his true dedication to improving his overall physical fitness level and his desire to lead by example
7632797 my job is such that much of what i do is reactive to whatever is going on
7632798 a soldier comes in the office and needs a power of attorney we do that a first sergeant or commander comes in with a packet for an article 15 we do that unless im going out on a claims mission its really difficult for me to say what i will be doing from one day to the next

7632806 he thinks hes famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving
7632807 nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really no one bothered to follow him
7632808 pictures of him and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to nobu is hardly worth it
7632809 its a great story shes carried the memory of her fiance throughout her whole life

7632814 i have called nick faldo and told him of my decision and hope that my performance so far this year will earn one of his two wild card picks
7632815 i think through the past weeks and months and years with the media talking about my putting and writing about my putting and people talking about my putting and people wanting to help me i must have had hundreds of letters and phone calls and all saying that they can fix my putting said singh
7632816 you know at the end of the day it kind of gets to your head that youre not a good putter
7632817 so i made a point after last week that im going to change that attitude i believed in myself that im the best putter and i came out here with a different attitude and i putted great this week if i keep doing this im going to win a lot more golf tournaments
7632818 last year we were a young team starting out with a lot of question marks
7632819 i would characterize 2007 as a successful year and i have a good feeling for 2008
7632820 when you look at the talents of most of the newcomers it points to offense
7632821 it is what we need we have proven that we can play defense and a few of the newcomers can step in to replace the seniors we lost
7632822 the nucleus of the defense is back and i feel good about that area we have proven that we can defend but my concern is to continue to defend hard and also score goals otherwise it puts too much pressure on us throughout the game
7632823 the only weakness i am concerned about is having to count on a number of freshmen to contribute immediately and do a good job you never know how they will do adjusting to college and the rigors of a military school it is a lot but they somehow do it every year the good thing is that we have a large group and chances are good that they will be able to step up and contribute
7632824 pia is physically imposing and has become more polished with the ball in finishing strong
7632825 she is more confident this year and we are expecting big things from her i feel she is capable of being a big time scorer and it makes her dangerous even if she doesnt score because she commands respect from her opponents
7632826 sarah is a very talented player who is dangerous on set plays such as corner kicks or free kicks
7632827 she hits the ball well and is equally strong in the air sarah is the best header on the team and has tremendous timing
7632828 the returnees will do a nice job as they look to extend upon the success enjoyed by this unit last year i am also pleased with the younger players in the program especially julia stoddard and lindsay gordon who can help us in the back with their attacking skills
7632829 this is the kind of team we want to have a balanced one that defends as a team and attacks as a team with numbers
7632830 the trip to st louis toys for tots tournament has always been a challenging one air force falcon invitational is constantly tough no matter who is hosting while colorado college is one of the toughest teams in the state our final weekend has us facing a much improved albany team at the governors cup
7632831 it is very difficult to make the patriot league tournament top four teams
7632832 every year it seems to go to the final weekend not only for who makes it but who is going to host top seed
7632833 i have to burp and poop i have to burp and poop i have to i have to i have to
7632834 the capture of abu tiba and abu uthman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the al qaida in iraq network
7632835 iraqi and coalition forces have made great strides in improving security in iraq especially in baghdad
7632836 it is fair to say they are still not living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement
7632837 over the weekend we have 48 sorties that have flown in with 774 short tons of materials
7632838 once we assemble the packets they are sent through iraqi channels to be vetted
7632839 if they are approved and deemed appropriate candidates the applicants will receive a class date and will attend the iraqi police academy for approximately four weeks
7632840 its good to see the local population wanting to step up and get involved and it will help us get out of here faster for them to take the point
7632841 its an honorable job to serve our nation as an iraqi but the salary will also help me support my family and will guarantee my familys future
7632842 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7632843 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7632844 i dont want to speculate on whether or not israel feels like it has a green light or not because that would be speculation
7632845 what is not speculation is that we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities

7632875 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
7632876 even the father of my rich trophy wife was a poor war hero like me he barely finished high school but flew a b 17 in world war ii and came back with practically nothing and realized the american dream and i am proud and grateful for that because that trollopy cunt i divorced my first wife for is richer than croesus
7632877 so not only am i a war hero and former prisoner of war im sort of related to another war hero you troop haters
7632878 hold on a second hey guadalupe wheres my fucking cappuccino you cunt
7632879 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time

7632887 scientists engineers and skilled workers showed the power of human ingenuity and enterprise in serving at this significant point in u s history
7632888 the men and women who worked on the b reactor made their mark on history with an extraordinary technological and human achievement
7632889 preservation of the b reactor will ensure their groundbreaking role in american history remains visible for future generations to see their accomplishments will serve as inspiration to others as we continue to apply science and technology to address todays most pressing global challenges
7632890 the return of these doctors is a positive thing because we are suffering from a severe shortage of personnel and we welcome doctors willing to their country
7632891 this result confirms what mr zardari has argued since 1997
7632892 the cause of this mishap was pilot error both men failed to clear their flight paths and did not recognize their impending high aspect mid air collision
7632893 they were doing maneuvers we do every day thousands of times in all of our air combat command flying aircraft
7632894 it was a different set of circumstances but it opens the question of whether jivanjee totally understood those closure moments
7632895 in doing so this company has fallen far short of meeting the high business standards that iowans expect
7632896 there will be no industrial jungles in iowa on my watch
7632897 in the end we are certain that the governor will see firsthand that our plant is anything but a jungle and that when all the bitterness of the last few months is taken out of the equation that we are indeed on a course to being on an even higher road
7632898 all iowans not just those who work within his administration have a right to know the level of the governors concerns and the fact that their government is acting responsibly in response to the disturbing reports
7632899 i was afraid of an abusive panhandler who happened to be black
7632900 concerned about someone googling someones name and being able to access it later
7632901 to find out who the men are you can buy tomorrows new zealand herald
7632902 over a decade of shrinking budgets has meant less money for realistic training there are also equipment shortages the net result is several layers of leadership that are really not well prepared for a shooting war the leaders of these nations have also been warned about this by their own special operations troops who have seen combat in afghanistan most of these operations have been kept secret as is normal for this sort of thing but the commandos from these different nations had opportunities to exchange notes and it was generally agreed that most post cold war european nations had let most of their combat troops down
7632903 we had a group that if you didnt turn the ball over you got a t shirt that said on the back its all about the ball
7632904 we were really focused on keeping the ball and as everyone knows that wins or loses games
7632905 its been a huge emphasis as players we carried it through summer workouts in the 7 on 7s you could tell cody was really focused on not turning the ball over as well as all the other quarterbacks and receivers
7632906 im trying to be cody hawkins just be the best i can be and hopefully thats the best for the buffalo program
7632907 last year when i had to run the ball i did fairly well he finished with minus 11 yards rushing with a long run of 12 yards and 97 yards lost in sack yardage
7632908 whenever ive been asked to do things ive been capable of doing them nobody on the staff is going to ask somebody to do something they cant theyre going to put us in position to succeed
7632909 but it was tough for me when it came to the aspect of having to call somebody out it was tough to call out guys who had been here for five years and tell them they need to do something when theyve been here through so much and been here for so long
7632910 i tried to focus on just the physical aspect of leadership show up at every workout and work very hard i think now im in a much better situation where i can call guys out and get guys here to throw extra i can call guys up to watch some extra film i can pump guys up i think i have a much better gauge for that
7632911 obviously its a big jump from your freshman to your sophomore season and your first year playing
7632912 i think hes got a lot more confidence more of a command of the offense and this year hes really got a leadership role guys are looking to him to be a playmaker
7632913 i think im a better leader now both vocally and in my body language im taking care of the ball better now i have a much better feel for the offense now than i used to particularly in knowing where to go with the ball
7632914 i think i have a better feel for when i can move i think ive always done a decent job of getting outside the pocket but the more i get a better feel for that i know when to run where to run and also when my protection breaks down where to go
7632915 in the shotgun i can move around i can talk to different guys for me one of my things is to be an energetic vocal guy if youre moving around you can line guys up when youre under center its tough to line guys up point to people and signal with this offense i can do things at a faster pace and have so many more options
7632916 kind of an underrated part of hawkins game hes certainly not a guy you can count on winning a game with his legs but hes also a guy whos going to be a little more productive than you think with his legs
7632917 i dont think thats something were going to design an entire game plan around but he certainly has the capability to make that a part of it
7632918 i always think every offense is better suited for a guy whos a little more mobile as long as he can still sling it
7632919 we still want to be able to throw the football efficiently and i think theres a certain type of guy that requires
7632920 you have to play to their strengths cody sees the field well starts in the right place almost all the time you have to build on his strengths and build the game plan around that
7632921 the organisers would have tried to get him to perform london calling at the opening ceremony
7632922 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7632923 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7632924 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7632925 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7632926 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7632929 no foreign soldiers will stay on the land of iraq
7632930 there is agreement between the two sides that there will not be any foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7632931 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side until we have a deal we dont have a deal

7632945 the common refrain everywhere we went was where do we get these cars
7632946 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7632947 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7632948 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7632949 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7632950 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7632951 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7632952 this year the traditional lower summertime rate is not as low as it used to be
7632953 is being touted by the media as a man of principle yet he was involved with other women while married to his first wife and was implicated in the so called keating scandal with four other senators
7632954 given these concerns about mccain it is difficult to understand how other republicans can support him with great pride and with absolutely no reservation unless they too are adulterous nonethical violent profane gambling alcoholic homos
7632955 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7632956 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7632957 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7632958 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7632959 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7632960 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7632961 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7632962 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7632963 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7632964 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7632965 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7632966 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7632967 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7632968 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7632969 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7632970 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7632971 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7632972 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7632973 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7632974 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7632975 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7632976 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7632977 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

7632989 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of rev martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
7632990 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7632991 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7632992 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter

7632994 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7632995 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7632996 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7632997 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7632998 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7632999 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7633000 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7633001 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7633002 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7633003 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7633004 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7633005 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7633006 who are open to doing something on the production side
7633007 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7633008 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7633009 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7633010 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7633011 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7633012 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7633013 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7633014 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7633015 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7633016 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7633017 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7633018 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7633019 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7633020 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7633021 i dont like your friends so i get pissy when you hang out with them
7633022 i can tell you why and its crap the belt wont work and rather than stopping things to fix it theyd rather screw us by giving us a break an hour early and fixing it then they normally only pull stunts like this during christmas when were swamped
7633023 so whats the deal with the belts turning on and off
7633024 its the one belt somebody ordered a shit ton of lube and the box broke open spilling the lube everywhere and it short circuited the whole damn thing
7633025 you listen to me and listen to me good janssen
7633026 i went down to the one belt myself because i didnt believe it either its a goddamn slip and slide of hotness down there the one belt is as lubed up as i wish my girlfriend was
7633027 im telling you janssen we need to strip down to our boxers get a running start and then slide all the way down that damn belt the guys working on the one wont know what to think i bet we look so hot when we finish that they all turn gay thats what i bet
7633028 i dont know if i want to work here anymore
7633029 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7633030 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7633031 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7633032 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7633033 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7633034 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7633035 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7633036 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7633037 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7633038 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7633039 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7633040 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7633041 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

7633044 those who would sacrifice essential liberties for a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7633045 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support
7633046 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support
7633047 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support
7633048 in the aftermath of 9 11 john mccain fought for the creation of an independent 9 11 commission to identify how to best address the terrorist threat and decrease our domestic vulnerability he fought for the establishment of the department of homeland security and the creation of the u s northern command with the specific responsibility of protecting the u s homeland

7633052 bipedalism is the most distinctive apparently earliest defining characteristic of humans
7633053 this behaviour is a good place to start in terms of what pre adapted the hominid body particularly the hip joint and knee joint for the adoption of habitual routine bipedalism
7633054 what did you do on your summer vacation did you go back to your country

7633057 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7633058 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7633059 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7633060 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7633061 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

7633065 the postponement of champions trophy is a body blow to pakistan but since the country is run by wrong people i see more trouble for cricket in the country he former world cup winning captain said
7633066 the event is postponed until next year but if the current government trying to outdo musharraf stays i fear the situation could worsen rather than improve said khan who now heads his own political party tehrik e insaaf movement for justice
7633067 it is not that we should not fight terrorism but the way musharraf led us into the war on terror by using gunship helicopters against our own people was fatal because as a blow back peace the economy and cricket have become casualties he said
7633068 under the situation when foreign investors are not willing to come to pakistan how can you expect foreign cricketers to travel to a country where we are fighting someone elses war he added
7633069 the way the outgoing chairman of the pakistan cricket board nasim ashraf spent funds for two years and now with the postponement of series after series pakistan cricket will soon run short of money said khan
7633070 not just from the spectators point of view but also funds wise these cancellations and postponement have hit pakistan cricket hard but i fear it will suffer more

7633078 the centre and the state government were delaying the decision to hand over the land to the board due to pressure from separatists in view of their dilly dallying tactics the samiti has decided to continue its agitation and so it has extended the bandh up to august 31

7633082 guys do tend to have hiccups for one or two games but these are quality players who are eager to get back into form its a question of playing out the early overs which we have not managed
7633083 with great regret and as there is not a single ray of hope that the ppp wants to restore the judges we have decided to withdraw from the coalition rather it would be more appropriate to say that we were forced to leave

7633093 knows the law so getting in the car is going to be difficult
7633094 first the presence of several air fresheners commonly used to mask the smell of narcotics hanging in the mercedes
7633095 the prior traffic stop of the mercedes in a drug trafficking area branchs evident nervousness the presence of air fresheners and the fact that branch was driving a car not registered to him these factors in combination could form the basis for a reasonable suspicion of narcotics trafficking
7633096 a seizure that is justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission
7633097 in sum there is insufficient evidence to establish the presence of air fresheners and at the very least there was evidence that called into question officer whites wavering testimony in this regard given that most people are nervous when pulled over by police officers officer whites observation that the defendant seemed nervous in conjunction with the defendants reputation as a drug dealer does not in my opinion rise to the level of reasonable articulable suspicion that would justify a thirty minute detention during a routine traffic incident

7633144 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7633145 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7633146 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7633147 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower

7633160 unfortunately danny has expressed his desire to quit our club
7633161 fc twente approached me to fill this position i see this as a new step in my career
7633162 we have received two interesting offers both of which are from english clubs
7633163 what we always do is defend our interests we wont sell any player if the bid is not the amount we have asked for
7633164 if they want albert riera theyll have to pay what espanyol is asking
7633165 while luis garcias possible transfer to benfica has stalled this one could be in its final hours
7633166 if someone does leave within the next 24 hours they will be replaced

7633171 it is right that sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer has flown to brazil in order to clarify the last details with the player alex silva and the selling club sao paulo
7633172 our team doctor dr oliver dierk has accompanied him in order to carry out our medical obligations he will examine the player on the spot
7633173 when the examinations and the last details with sao paulo are sorted we expect all three back in hamburg by the middle of the week the exact time frame is still not certain though
7633174 the board and the coach martin jol made clear after the departure of vincent kompany that the transfer fee should be invested straight back into strengthening the team
7633175 it is to be assumed that this week yet more transfers will be negotiated

7633191 the focus of this mission may not be one of our primary missions but it certainly is a primary focus of the current mission of providing humanitarian assistance to the folks here in georgia
7633192 our job was to get the supplies to georgia as quickly as possible
7633193 the entire crew of this ship realizes the significance of their efforts in helping to provide comfort to the people of georgia

7633198 when i saw phillips die i looked down and was bleeding pretty good thats probably the most scared i was at any point
7633199 when you ask for volunteers to run across an open field to a reinforced op that almost everybody is injured at and everybody volunteers it feels good there were a lot of guys that made me proud putting themselves and their lives on the line so their buddies could have a chance
7633200 its usually three rpgs some sporadic fire and then theyre gone i dont where they got all those rpgs that was crazy
7633201 it was some of the bravest stuff ive ever seen in my life and i will never see it again because those guys
7633202 just guys kicking ass basically just making sure that we look scary enough that you dont want to come in and try to get us
7633203 perhaps the most important take away from that encounter though is the one that the mainstream media couldnt be bothered to pay attention long enough to learn that not for the first time a contingent of american soldiers that was outnumbered by up to a twenty to one ratio soundly and completely repulsed a complex pre planned assault by those dedicated enough to their cause to kill themselves in its pursuit that kind of heroism and against all odds success is and has been a hallmark of americas fighting men and women and it is one that is worthy of all attention we can possibly give it

7633205 if you have never read auster before this is the place to start

7633233 wenn ich jetzt durch mein eigenes land fahre muss ich immer damit rechnen an einem russischen kontrollpunkt angehalten zu werden das ist nichts anderes als illegale besatzung
7633234 seit 30 jahren bringe ich jungen georgiern russisch und die russische kultur nahe wie soll ich jetzt meinen sch lern unter die augen treten wir brauchen eine echte internationale friedenstruppe unter un f hrung nicht russische besatzer
7633235 tod dem juden saakaschwili ruhm den luftlandestreitkr ften der russischen f deration
7633236 poti und umgebung sind ab sofort teil der mit abchasien vereinigten sicherheitszone unter aufsicht der russischen friedenstruppen
7633237 es ist beschlossen worden alle bewaffneten georgischen formationen zu entwaffnen unsere kontrollpunkte werden daf r sorgen dass keinerlei bewaffnete in die sicherheitszone kommen und du mein freund wirst uns dabei helfen
7633238 von mir aus k nnt ihr euch im stadtzentrum versammeln und euren saakaschwili hochleben lassen aber nicht an standorten der russischen armee das wird eure aufgabe sein
7633239 wir werden in poti den eisenbahnverkehr und den hafenverkehr visuell kontrollieren und sicherstellen dass keine milit rischen g ter abgefertigt werden die georgische marine gibt es hier ab sofort nicht mehr
7633240 meine m nner und ich sind keine friedenstruppen wir sind fallschirmspringer ich unterstehe general schamanow
7633241 wenn du nicht kooperierst fahre ich zu schamanow zur ck und sage ihm in poti gibt es einen polizeichef der nicht mit uns kooperieren will wenn wir uns hier nicht einigen dann mein freund wird es hier keine georgische polizei keine staatsanwaltschaft und berhaupt nichts georgisches mehr geben
7633242 freedom of speech is an american concept so i dont give it any value
7633243 ive got to do a better job of putting the guys in the right position
7633244 i just got done telling you that he wanted to play
7633245 i have recommended this book to so many different types of people young and old male and female and i havent heard one negative review of it
7633246 in fact friends of friends of friends and distant relatives of friends have gone out of their way to tell me how much they liked it
7633247 it is not offensive per se for women to be topless it may be distasteful to some but in my view the council reference to offensive cannot reasonably apply in these circumstances

7633254 illegal immigrants is no longer a serious problem the number of illegal immigrants entering india has been reduced considerably
7633255 they attacked us suddenly abused us for our paravartan mission and dragged us out to kill our driver and angrakshak were roughly beaten up it was a pre meditated plan to kill us the area is dominated by converted christians and minority hindus suffer a lot we were going to perform a religious satsang there the attackers told us that their government is ruling at delhi and they can do everything in my 90 years of life i have never faced such an incident swelling of their number by massive conversion has increased their anti national and criminal activities the administration has failed to check conversion in vanvasi areas we will not stop our mission protection of hindutva is my diksha
7633256 investigation is going on from preliminary inquiry it is disclosed that the attackers chalked out a plan to kidnap swamijee and to kill him on december 25
7633257 i have come here to stay i consider india my second home the news being given out that i am leaving india is not true
7633258 i will do everything in my power to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon everything in my power to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon everything
7633259 we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there
7633260 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharraf wont act we will
7633261 i believed it was a grave mistake to allow ourselves to be distracted from the fight against al qaeda and the taliban by invading a country that posed no imminent threat and had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
7633262 since then more than 4 000 americans have died and we have spent nearly 1 trillion our military is overstretched nearly every threat we face from afghanistan to al qaeda to iran has grown
7633263 he just wants to be on the side thats winning
7633264 vote to adopt an amendment that allows the senate budget committee chairman to raise spending levels to increase border security expand enforcement of immigration laws increase penalties against employers who hire undocumented immigrants deploy national guard troops to the southern and northern borders of the united states and identify and deport non citizen immigrants in prisons provided that such spending would not increase the budget deficit
7633265 obama supports a system that allows undocumented immigrants who are in good standing to pay a fine learn english and go to the back of the line for the opportunity to become citizens
7633266 one of the things weve got to figure out in our political culture generally is distinguishing between really dumb policies and policies that rise to the level of criminal activity you know i often get questions about impeachment at town hall meetings and ive said that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances
7633267 well look obviously there was a tragedy in new york i said at the time without benefit of all the facts before me that it looked like a possible case of excessive force the judge has made his ruling and were a nation of laws so we respect the verdict that came down
7633268 but if we are honest with ourselves well admit that what too many fathers also are is missing missing from too many lives and too many homes they have abandoned their responsibilities acting like boys instead of men and the foundations of our families are weaker because of it you and i know how true this is in the african american community we know that more than half of all black children live in single parent households a number that has doubled doubled since we were children we know the statistics that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime nine times more likely to drop out of schools and twenty times more likely to end up in prison they are more likely to have behavioral problems or run away from home or become teenage parents themselves and the foundations of our community are weaker because of it
7633269 im not getting conned by the lesser of two evils logic anymore
7633270 will even a temporary reduction in prices take voters minds off energy issues in the upcoming election
7633271 yea the wonderful government you didnt expect them to do something smart did you
7633272 some lawmakers have blamed these firms for the volatility of oil prices
7633273 it was so quiet and comfortable compared with my regular small car it was a paradise
7633274 by 2015 we project that we will have saved more on our energy bills than we have spent on all of our planned investments to that point
7633275 many american consumers even in the face of economic uncertainty express a willingness to pay more for environmentally friendly products
7633276 toyota cant make the prius fast enough to meet consumer demand to cite just one example and many see green products as the wave of the future
7633277 these results suggest that manufacturers who offer high quality and credibly labeled eco friendly products will have opportunities to gain a competitive edge
7633278 the outlook is not good but we are giving the calf its only option it cant be fed and in fact we wouldnt know what to feed it
7633279 for the past few days our phone has just been ringing off the hook
7633280 with this growing number of graduates the potential is limitless
7633281 i think it deals with a topic that no one wants to talk about
7633282 we understand theres a problem with the way society views how women are beautiful but we never do anything about it and i think this play just throws it back in our faces
7633283 what drew me to fat pig was its cruelty and its honesty about the flaws of human nature
7633284 it questions our dogmatic belief of what beauty should be we strive for weight loss and fitness not because its healthy but because of the images we continually receive from a very young age
7633285 the downloading or distribution of unauthorized copies of intellectual property such as movies television music games and software programs via the internet
7633286 if theres salmon swimming therell be a bear on a river
7633287 they are not hunting people they are very adept and silent hunters
7633288 if they were out to get us theyd get us
7633289 hopefully one of the reasons why they chose to come here is for the people that are here the coaches the community that they see when they come on their visit and eventually the program will be successful enough that one of the reasons that they come is for our success in volleyball
7633290 we definitely want the players to improve as the season goes along we are not going to worry too much about wins and losses we want to keep getting better as a team and compete well especially in the gnac
7633291 we outlined a lot of expectations on the first day
7633292 as far as what we expect from them each and every day of practice what we expect from them as students our expectations for them as people in the community and as young ladies in the community
7633293 the students in the camai room watch out for one another
7633294 if theres any concern about a friend students reach out to me to get help for that friend
7633295 students who are engaged and know the goal theyre working toward are the ones we see fly through their degree program
7633296 when they know how theyll use their education to better the lives of people theyre on their books and on top of classes the students who tumble through semesters because theyre not sure why theyre here are the students who have a big challenge going from admission to graduation
7633297 the moment we label somebody its easier for them to follow that label i dont want to set these students up for failure because all of them are very capable of succeeding well at school
7633298 we find that students face the same kinds of challenges transitioning from small schools to anchorage
7633299 i had a family bring their non native student to our center because he was born and raised in a village and was used to being in a village he felt uncomfortable coming here so we helped him register for classes
7633300 being away from home is hard but home will always be there for you make the best out of the experience away from home if people are homesick i hope they surround themselves with other people come to the camai room if theyre homesick because theres always somebody here for them
7633301 so you preach to the choir for moral support theyll laugh at your punch lines and see you in court
7633302 the one message id like to leave with the public is please do your homework before you hire somebody and please hire a licensed contractor
7633303 we dont have the foot soldiers or the strength to really offset the tide
7633304 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7633305 when michael rang me last tuesday i was on my way to new zealand
7633306 he said dad youve got to come and see me
7633307 i said to my wife maybe the doctors have told him hes only got a few weeks to live
7633308 so we cancelled everything and jumped on the plane and went to see him in melbourne and thats when he told us the story
7633309 we were just in absolute shock and we still are we havent had time to get our head around it he said i dont have cancer ive had two lives that ive lived
7633310 his wife amanda who has been with him for seven years found out the day before we did and shes had no idea
7633311 michael has had a severe addiction to pornography the addiction to pornography started when he was 12
7633312 its horrendous because we dont have that sort of stuff around he was raised in a christian home weve never brought that stuff into our home
7633313 he lived the two lives and he would get sick as a result of the guilt
7633314 he was feeling like he was letting god down letting his family down his church his friends
7633315 hes been living this for so long feeling like hes had these two lives and now hes the one thats come out in the open he confessed it he didnt get caught
7633316 to deal with the guilt he would pour himself into doing good work hes touched the lives of young people all over the world now they are all affected by this
7633317 he hasnt done this for any reasons that have been portrayed that hes a fraud
7633318 it was either keep pretending or come out with the truth and tell everything hes come out with everything but now weve got the consequences of it all
7633319 we have to accept it were hoping to share with our congregation how it all started and how it got where it is
7633320 an addiction like this is not going to be fixed overnight you cant have a 16 year problem and fix it in a week
7633321 they have said to me that he is very ill they are assessing where reality stopped and fantasy kicked in and whats caused all this
7633322 the doctor believes that at times michael was totally convinced that he had this sickness
7633323 when he was about 12 he did vomit all the time hed get really really sick
7633324 he was in the adelaide childrens hospital for seven weeks at one stage he didnt eat and we thought we were going to lose him
7633325 they took out his appendix thinking that it might be that but they realised that it wasnt
7633326 they gave us the option of putting him in a psychiatric ward to see if there was something psychological but we felt uncomfortable with that at the time
7633327 we signed him out from hospital and then he would go a few months and then he would get sick again
7633328 wed always take him to hospital wed always do the proper thing but they couldnt get to the bottom of it until now
7633329 we have watched our son go through what we thought was cancer
7633330 my wife and i over the past two years have watched him vomit in buckets having nosebleeds and even his hair fell out in clumps at one stage
7633331 every time we saw him we saw symptoms he stayed with us for a while where we had to put a special air conditioner in one of the rooms because he would heat up so much in the middle of winter
7633332 he had this cold air conditioner blowing on him to try to keep the heat down as a professional minister ive stood in front of my congregation and cried and said to pray for my son
7633333 ive travelled the world asking people to pray for him can you imagine what a horrible thing it would be if i was playing a game
7633334 to be honest i ask myself as a father what did i miss what did i not do
7633335 details on ripping games to your xbox 360 hdd are still to be announced but it appears that the only limitation on users is that the game disc must be in the drive in order to play
7633336 thats the new look of the xbox 360s guide accessible from the big old guide button on the standard controller
7633337 xbox lives larry hryb showed netflix integration in action updating his queue via the web which then updated automatically on the xbox 360
7633338 tengo un problema de ingenier a a pesar de que la mayor parte de m est en excelente forma f sica tengo 10 tumores en mi h gado y s lo me quedan unos meses de vida
7633339 no podemos cambiar las cartas que nos han sido dadas pero s podemos jugar la partida
7633340 fue un partido muy bonito llegar a una final ol mpica es muy dif cil y jugar como jugamos contra estados unidos que estaba mucho mejor que en otros campeonatos y estar con posibilidades de victoria hasta el final es para sentirse orgullosos
7633341 es relativamente f cil entrenarles porque hay mucho talento desde el principio ten a el reto de sustituir a pepu con el que se hab an conseguido cosas muy importantes y sab a que si no lo consegu a se me iba a echar todo encima lo ten a asumido y estoy muy contento
7633342 hemos conseguido una plata y hemos plantado cara al equipo americano jugamos un partido incre ble y creo que merecimos la victoria as que estamos muy satisfechos
7633343 una final ol mpica no se juega todos los d as
7633344 no puede considerarse como un fracaso conseguir 18 medallas porque hay muchas cosas que influyen en un deportista

7633350 do you really think nuns are all wizened funereal old ladies today its not like that any more thanks to an injection of youth and vitality brought to our country by foreign girls
7633351 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7633352 and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the clintons and the clinton wing of the party
7633353 that puts him in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7633354 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7633355 you dont rah rah about commander in chief you rah rah about hope and change and a new party and all that so no matter what he does somebody will find fault with it
7633356 now judging from the trailer i thought this was going be like a movie were jason statman hasto find the killer of his wife and at the same time has to play in these races
7633357 as a runner youre allowed to do that what doug ruled at second base was even though a j did kind of stick his arm out to make contact aybar was still in his way so a j if he would have turned he wouldnt have been able to continue on to third so after making the throw aybar is no longer in the act of fielding and he cant obstruct the runner which is what doug ruled happened and in a rundown even though a j was going back to second the rule of obstruction during a rundown is he gets his next advanced base and thats why he was rewarded third base
7633358 even though a j did kind of stick his arm out to make contact aybar was still in his way
7633359 so a j if he would have turned he wouldnt have been able to continue on to third
7633360 so after making the throw aybar is no longer in the act of fielding and he cant obstruct the runner
7633361 if aybars got the ball theres no obstruction you protect the fielder when hes in the act of fielding once that balls released and out of his hand he has to vacate
7633362 youve got more of the concerns weve seen about credit and the financials lehmans down because of the speculation that the bid is not happening and theres a negative report on aig
7633363 the credit crisis is more than a year old and still there are lots and lots of issues
7633364 investor psychology is certainly suffering from credit crisis fatigue people are disappointed that the situation is not visibly improving
7633365 clearly there is no light at the end of the housing tunnel yet
7633366 the supply of unsold homes is still very high suggesting theres going to be downward pressure on prices well into 2009
7633367 although there are many regional and sector specific composites events throughout the year there is no national get together and over the years many fabricators suppliers as well as academics have wondered why we dont develop a canadian composites show and conference
7633368 the composites council of cpia is hopeful that this expoplast effort may be the catalyst that will evolve into an on going composites event for canada
7633369 defend the world without catching your cape in the bus door
7633370 its up to the discretion of the driver but i believe everybody is taking action
7633371 they have broad ability to restrict or deny carry ons
7633372 the suit claims obama was not born an american citizen lost any hypothetical american citizenship he had as a child may not now be an american citizen and even if he is may hold dual citizenships with other countries
7633373 editors note this point is not supported by u s citizenship law
7633374 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7633375 is reporting that analysts working separately have determined the birth certificate posted on the daily kos website and later on sen barack obamas fight the smears campaign website is fraudulent
7633376 i guess its exciting because now im attending the university im still a freshman but youre part of the group now
7633377 im looking forward to it its kind of like starting my new life college life
7633378 the energy is just amazing everybody weve talked to the parents the students are excited to be here
7633379 we were a little worried before but weve got room for everybody and then some
7633380 its kind of when they pass through the columns its the next step in their life
7633381 and you want to be here you want to do this
7633382 a couple of his teammates in a fit of high spirits took a photo of him sitting on a toilet and in what they saw as a prank circulated this photo to other team members
7633383 this was inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign for which the team members concerned have been suspended from the team
7633384 all three swimmers are very remorseful and have apologised to team management for what was poor judgement on their part and accept the punishment handed down
7633385 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
7633386 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed they know that and well look at it in greater depth when we get home
7633387 we only have one rule in the olympic team that we respect one another
7633388 unlike prop 85 or 73 the sarahs law initiative allows an adult relative of the minor seeking an abortion to be notified if the minors parents are abusive
7633389 a search firm is going to want to do their own
7633390 obviously you want a strong educator who understands school finance a good communicator with good leadership qualities then provide a lot of opportunities for good community input to add to what you want as a board
7633391 i dont think you want too early to go out and ask about a financial issue down the road
7633392 if you sent it out now youd know the answer
7633393 to michael although the evitation say november 5 which was a saturday so maybe they were working on saturday
7633394 should i replace my light bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps cfls today or wait until they burn out
7633395 dont say it dont say it i cant believe he said that
7633396 when we first proposed the cut in january we knew it was difficult but necessary we need to achieve these savings
7633397 why dont you put a different name on your resume
7633398 if they dont want sufiya abdur rahman then they dont want me

7633403 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7633404 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discreet charm
7633405 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case anymore
7633406 minutes before the official announcement of pope benedicts election cardinal macharski points to the liberal reporters assembled in st

7633408 macharski emboldened by the felicitous election of ratzinger jumps the gun and announces gaudium magnum annuntio urbi orbi et universo
7633409 development of race based products such as vitamins and drugs
7633410 misleading the public to believe that races are biologically distinct requiring race specific products but the basis for their wares flies in the face of science
7633411 while there are some differences in disease prevalence among races there are no diseases or conditions and certainly no nutritional requirements that are exclusive to just one group
7633412 if weve learned anything from the last decade of genetics research its that our dna is generally colorblind
7633413 as a genetics researcher and someone of mixed heritage myself these companies reflect a troubling trend
7633414 given the wide variation within groups the development of a genetically specific formula would be challenging to say the least
7633415 the recent increase in the numbers of people who identify with more than one race would seem to pose a rather large problem to the companies marketing race based products
7633416 although genetics is involved in most if not all aspects of our health the environment plays at least an equal role
7633417 even if we knew which genes played a part in our dietary needs its unlikely those differences would follow perceived racial divides
7633418 were working with police about whats happened over the summer and what new pseudo gang has come around
7633419 were just making sure we get enough information to monitor situations and make sure these kids dont bring stuff from the community into the schools
7633420 the jamboree is a no charge event and that creates a new dynamic the jamboree is not really a game so kids are really there to socialize
7633421 we just need to make sure the right kids are on campus and do things to be more vigilant
7633422 ninety nine percent of the kids do the right thing the 1 percent who dont make it difficult
7633423 i think even saying youre going to have a search has its problems
7633424 you have to define what that is and how far youre going to search we do have a lot of police at games how many more do you have its hard to find the answer that completely ensures safety but we continue to look for reasonable ways to supervise crowds
7633425 i just want to know when can the family members come up and be heard
7633426 i want them to exhume my sister so i can identify her and i want them to pay for it

7633908 there is no way i would cheat on my husband even if he is in remission i am so saddened and disappointed to find out he is just another philandering shyster politician

7633915 a marriage in the public eye is very different than a normal marriage
7633916 since politicians and their families are scrutinized and held to much higher standards than say a celebrity many marriages stay intact through problems so their careers wont suffer

7633950 they are good economic projects but they require us to spend significant capital in terms of the investment required to build and maintain and operate those facilities so clearly we are taking on an expense challenge but in exchange for that we expect to see and have seen higher gross margins on the merchandise side and a slight deterioration in our expense rate and the combination of those factors is a very solid economic proposition for us

7634030 poland and the u s signed a deal to build a controversial missile defence shield in eastern europe
7634031 the agreement highlights how russias invasion of georgia has prompted a swift reappraisal of the regions security and alliances the u s and poland have been talking about the missile shield for a year but rushed to cement their alliance in the wake of this weeks conflict
7634032 tried and failed just before leaving for europe on monday 7 july to seal a deal to place missiles in poland the state department said
7634033 sie sind alle ernsthaft besorgt dar ber dass es heute georgien und einer von ihnen morgen
7634034 polen und den usa unterzeichnet einen vertrag zum bau eines umstrittenen raketenabwehrsystem in osteuropa
7634035 die vereinbarung verdeutlicht wie die russische invasion in georgien hat eine rasche neubewertung der regionalen sicherheit und allianzen die usa und polen wurden spreche von der raketenschild f r ein jahr sondern eilte zu zementieren ihre allianz im zuge der in dieser woche den konflikt
7634036 versucht und haben es vers umt kurz vor seiner abreise nach europa am montag 7 juli versiegeln eine einigung zu platzieren raketen in polen der state department sagte
7634037 if that dude squidward dont get off my ass im gonna kill him
7634038 die diskussionen gehen weiter da wir noch zu keiner einigung gekommen sind
7634039 diese forderung erschwert eine l sung der konflikte im kaukasus
7634040 unsere position ist klar die territoriale integrit t georgiens steht nicht zur disposition eine politische l sung der konflikte muss auf dieser grundlage erfolgen
7634041 dies hat nichts mit der situation in georgien zu tun
7634042 in keiner weise sind die raketenabwehrpl ne des pr sidenten gegen russland gerichtet
7634043 der zweck der abwehrraketen besteht darin unsere europ ischen verb ndeten vor bedrohungen durch schurkenstaaten zu sch tzen
7634044 entgegen der offiziellen version von ministerpr sident tusk und des us au enministeriums spielte der krieg in georgien eine entscheidende rolle bei der beschleunigung der polnisch amerikanischen vertragsverhandlungen ber die abwehrraketen der krieg war der letzte ansto f r tusk seine zustimmung zu dem abkommen zu geben
7634045 sollte der raketenschild tats chlich der abwehr iranischer raketen dienen so w re der russische kompromissvorschlag ein gemeinsames abfangsystem in aserbaidschan zu errichten weit besser daf r geeignet denn dort stationierte abfangraketen k nnten iranische raketen bereits am beginn ihrer flugbahn treffen und zerst ren
7634046 dass die usa diesen kompromissvorschlag ausgeschlagen haben l sst nur einen schluss zu der raketenschild richtet sich in erster linie nicht gegen den iran sondern gegen russland dies wird auch dadurch unterstrichen dass die anderen basen des raketenschildes ebenfalls in grenzregionen zu russland wie beispielsweise alaska stationiert sind
7634047 die strategische bedeutung des systems besteht darin jene paar dutzend raketen abzufangen die moskau nach einem amerikanischen berraschungsangriff noch f r einen zweitschlag zur verf gung st nden der raketenschild ist also ein entscheidender faktor in dem bem hen eine nukleare erstschlagkapazit t gegen ber russland aufzubauen zwar ist zun chst geplant nur zehn abfangraketen in polen zu stationieren doch sofern das system erst einmal errichtet ist k nnte deren zahl leicht erh ht werden
7634048 dieser artikel f hrt einem vor augen worin die wirkliche funktion des raketenschilds besteht er soll den usa die f higkeit sichern einen atomkrieg zu f hren ohne selbst von gegenschl gen getroffen zu werden w re diese f higkeit erst einmal erworben so lie e sie sich als geopolitisches druckmittel einsetzen um nationale interessen durchzusetzen
7634049 durch die stationierung setzt sich polen ganz klar einem gegenschlag aus
7634050 zwischen denen die in der atlantischen struktur sein wollen und denen au erhalb
7634051 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
7634052 us missiles in europe beyond deterrence to first strike threat
7634053 by means of a us first strike about 99 of russian nuclear forces would be taken out
7634054 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere
7634055 it would be better to look for other ways to fight terrorism than create low yield nuclear weapons that lower the threshold for using these weapons and thereby put humankind on the brink of nuclear catastrophe
7634056 i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
7634057 sobald die raketenabwehr system eingef hrt wird es funktionieren wird automatisch mit dem gesamten nuklearen f higkeiten der vereinigten staaten
7634058 langj hrige us politik der nuklearen ersten schlag gegen russland
7634059 us raketen in europa beyond deterrence bei first strike threat
7634060 mit hilfe eines us erstschlag ber 99 der russischen nuklearen streitkr fte w rden
7634061 einige menschen haben die illusion dass man alles tun so wie sie wollen unabh ngig von den interessen anderer menschen
7634062 es w re besser sich nach anderen m glichkeiten zur bek mpfung des terrorismus schaffen als low yield atomwaffen senken die schwelle f r den einsatz dieser waffen und damit die menschheit an den rand einer nuklearen katastrophe
7634063 ich bin davon berzeugt dass wir erreicht haben das entscheidende moment als wir m ssen ernsthaft gedanken ber die architektur der globalen sicherheit

7634098 you know weve been politically involved on the margins of campaigns but hes taken it to a level that we havent engaged in and in fact hes been an inspiration to me

7634101 the learning experience that you get on a campaign with organizing tips and different people skills and just how to run a campaign how to win an election is just going to be amazing

7634107 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror
7634108 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired in a final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed

7634120 a government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have

7634128 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7634129 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7634130 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the than idolizing someone standing on the street corner

7634145 the coastline as it is now will be completely changed by the end of this century because the sea level is rising along the coast at around two centimetres every year
7634146 increasing salinity will make the ground water undrinkable and unsuitable for agricultural purposes the result will be food and water insecurity
7634147 it is all due to climate change the greenhouse gas emissions result in global warming and subsequent melting of the greenland ice cap
7634148 i think the best way out for the moment is devising simpler and more cost effective solutions such as how to preserve towns and villages under threat and preventing sea water intrusion
7634149 the sensible option is moving to higher ground which is a tough option especially for nigeria as it means giving up its economic centres in lagos and its oil installations in the delta
7634150 every solution to a problem must focus on the major cause of that problem and in this case greenhouse gas emissions by industrialised countries which are responsible for sea level rise must be effectively tackled
7634151 the industrialised countries should take proactive steps in curtailing their emissions responsible for climate change which will have a positive impact on sea level rise

7634162 in the world of eternal return the weight of unbearable responsibility lies heavy on every move we make that is why nietzsche called the idea of eternal return the heaviest of burdens the absolute absence of a burden causes man to be lighter than air to soar into the heights take leave of the earth and his earthly being and become only half real his movements as free as they are insignificant

7634172 the united states expressed regret sunday for any civilian deaths from us led military operations in afghanistan without confirming reports of nearly
7634173 we regret the loss of life among the innocent afghanis who we are committed to protect
7634174 what the united states is talking about is integrating the missions they recognize that there are serious difficulties arising because there are two separate missions in afghanistan now and have been from the beginning operation enduring freedom oef and the international security assistance force right now there are two americans in command of both and what they are talking about is integrating the bulk of the american troops who are in operation enduring freedom
7634175 canadians are rather conflicted about why theyre in afghanistan some people saw this as an apology for not going to iraq and some people actually genuinely think that being in afghanistan is about helping the afghan people and if thats your position then id think this is all good because its going to be more help and more substantive help
7634176 some of the success from iraq into the afghan theatre as well
7634177 the american tactic of aerial bombings where there are civilians
7634178 the hill times inquired with communication shops at both the department of national defence and the department of foreign affairs about an increased american presence in the nato led mission however neither responded conservative mp deepak obhrai calgary east alta the parliamentary secretary to the foreign affairs minister and conservative mp wajid khan mississauga streetsville ont a member of the house standing committee on foreign affairs were also contacted but staff for both mps said they were unavailable for comment
7634179 i join with canadians who stand proudly in support our men and women of the canadian forces as they courageously risk their lives every day to bring peace and security to the people of afghanistan their sacrifice will not be forgotten we will honour their sacrifice by continuing on with this vital mission canadas commitment to peace and security in afghanistan remains resolute we will not allow the taliban to deter us from continuing to help afghans rebuild their country

7634183 i believe the democrats have a much greater problem than the outside activists who are not allowed in to enhance the debate
7634184 i think their problem is that they are so busy kowtowing to the status quo to republicans really its unbelievable the lack of leadership and courage and vision that the democratic leadership has shown
7634185 five or six times congress has clearly passed resolutions or bills that say there will not be permanent bases in iraq and yet were talking about possibly 50 000 or 60 000 troops remaining the bases being built there look very permanent to us

7634201 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the sixties trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7634202 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
7634203 and the fact that hes launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
7634204 doesnt look like those other presidents on the dollar bills

7634210 i am honored to receive the endorsement of a man who has provided great service to our state and our nation senator reed has been at the forefront confronting difficult issues in a meaningful way and i have a great respect for his work and accomplishments
7634211 i hope to continue my work in the state senate addressing issues of concern to working families and i appreciate his support

7634226 woodrow wilson s new freedom promised our nation a new political and economic framework franklin d roosevelt s new deal promised security to those in need but the new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promises it is a set of challenges it sums not what i intend to offer the american people but what i intend to ask of them
7634227 i cant deliver any magic potion no president can but we can make things better if we all decide to give it up some and pull together and that means living in the here and now of the 21st century and engaging in the world as it is not as it was and that means electing a president who yes uses a computer and knows from mac powerbooks and it also means fighting the corporations tooth and nail for the soul of our country and that means pushing back on the politics of greed and selfishness now and forever
7634228 experience is evidentally not a reliable measure when judging presidential performance vs their experience its all over the map
7634229 of course the same is true in business for example most of the computer companies that are now mega corporations were started by kids in garages
7634230 i myself got hired by a very big very famous company into a pretty important position with no experience i just convinced them to do it i wound up being one of their two top performing executives and brought very significant turnaround to several departments in the company no experience
7634231 nowadays i hire people because of what they can do not what they have done or not
7634232 if experience was so important then only the top senators would have a chance in elections the ones that have been in the senate for 25 years or more has this been the case
7634233 experience does not matter either to performance nor to the american people because were smarter than that experience doesnt guarantee a person it just tells you about what type of person they are

7634256 it would be a great shame if we didnt make the most of the potential that is there the recent past has shown that the two markets are making steps towards each other it is the combination of both sectors as well as innovative technologies that make our market interesting we too are progressing more and more in this direction we plan to increase webmaster integration this year in the venus web area and were currently working with several companies on the right concepts for this after all the webmaster is the retailer of the online sector
7634257 we feel that we have neglected this sector in the past
7634258 we will now provide an additional attraction increasing the venus portfolio retailers can increase their collections and find new interesting offers there are also retailers selling directly to consumers there will be a separate stage for shows and performances on a fetish theme and to round this off there will be a large fetish party on saturday evening at insomnia one of the favorite fetish clubs in berlin
7634259 everything beyond the adult market from packaging machines coffee machines to shop fitters
7634260 every year we are confronted by exhibitors who want to come to berlin but dont want to be confronted with the adult business
7634261 until this year a shop fitter could be exhibiting next to a hardcore film supplier and would be unable to avoid staring at the screen all day we wanted to create an area for erotic free products and services
7634262 it was always difficult to convince suppliers in the non adult markets to exhibit at the venus
7634263 many people still consider the venus as a porn show but the venus has long since become a lifestyle trade show with both an erotic and pornographic flair so the demand was there and new exhibitors and visitors from a vast variety of sectors means that the venus continues to expand were not quite sure where the non adult area will be exactly but it will certainly be separated from the other areas it all depends on the number of exhibitors and their individual exhibiting space
7634264 the trade show goes on for four days and we wanted to provide something special on the sunday all trade visitors who visit the venus on sunday have free entrance there will also be a live show by the wildecker herzbuben and therell be free beer and sausages for all trade visitors it should be a fantastic sunday in berlin

7634378 a property next to this convicted slum lord tony rezko his property is 300 000 below value the other guy paid full price he buys part of rezkos property and lo and behold what did we find that the convicted slum lord with the help of barack obama got 14 million from the state of illinois thanks to baracks help
7634379 does open up the question of how did you buy a house for cheaper than the market price and then either the day after or that day the rezko buys the next door lot at full price and then sells you a part of it so that you can have as big a yard as you want to have and this guy is a dirty guy whos now on his way to the federal pen
7634380 t he couple who sold barack obama his chicago home said the illinois senators 1 65 million bid was the best offer and they didnt cut their asking price because a campaign donor bought their adjacent land according to e mails between obamas presidential campaign and the seller
7634381 t he appraisal did note that the other parcel rezkos remaining parcel would be fully developable if he sold this to me and so rather than pay the appraised price i paid one sixth of the cost of his property he agreed to sell that 10 foot strip

7634458 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7634459 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7634460 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7634461 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7634462 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7634463 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7634464 my personal opinion is anyone involved in a crime should be charged
7634465 how can satan drive out satan if a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand and if a house is divided against itself that house will not be able to stand and if satan has risen up against himself and is divided he cannot stand that is the end of him but no one can enter a strong mans house to plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man then he can plunder his house amen i say to you all sins and all blasphemies that people utter will be forgiven them but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will never have forgiveness but is guilty of an everlasting sin
7634466 therefore i tell you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven
7634467 not that this is a blasphemy which shall not be forgiven forasmuch as even this shall be forgiven if a right repentance follow it but because as i have said there arose hence a cause for that sentence to be delivered by the lord since mention had been made of the unclean spirit whom the lord shows to be divided against himself because of the holy spirit who is not only not divided against himself but who also makes those whom he gathers together undivided by forgiving those sins which are divided against themselves and by inhabiting those who are cleansed that it may be with them as it is written in the acts of the apostles
7634468 but in this passage according to matthew 12 32 the lord far more plainly explained what he intended to be understood here namely that he who speaks a word against the holy spirit who with an impenitent heart resist the unity of the church where in the holy spirit is given the remission of sins for this spirit they have not as has been said already who even though they bear and handle the sacraments of christ are seperated from his congregation
7634469 although in ways known to himself god can lead those who through no fault of their own are ignorant of the gospel to that faith without which it is impossible to please him the church still has the obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all men
7634470 the church knows that she is joined in many ways to the baptized who are honored by the name of christian but do not profess the catholic faith in its entirety or have not preserved unity or communion under the successor of peter
7634471 who believe in christ and have been properly baptized are put in a certain although imperfect communion with the catholic church
7634472 that it lacks little to attain the fullness that would permit a common celebration of the lords eucharist
7634473 do unto others as you would have them do unto you

7634481 as we grow internally and expand nationally we need to augment our executive team with quality people with real world experience and the drive to make certain that our current clients and new customers are entirely satisfied bill has all of these qualifications and i am excited to begin working with him
7634482 yet we underestimate its power and its prevalence highly destructive complacency is in fact all around us including in places where people would deny it deny it and deny it still more
7634483 in a fast moving and changing world a sleepy or steadfast contentment with the status quo can create disaster
7634484 this flurry of behaviour is not driven by any underlying determination to move and win now its driven by pressures that create anxiety and anger the resulting frantic activity is more distracting than useful
7634485 who can feel absolutely determined to deal now with the central issues facing an organization after racing into nine meetings on nine different topics in the space of one day
7634486 with a true sense of urgency people want to come to work each day ready to co operate energetically and responsively with intelligent initiatives from others and they do people want to find ways to launch smart initiatives and they do they dont move at 35 miles per hour when 65 is needed to win
7634487 behaving with passions conviction optimism urgency and a steely determination will trump an analytically brilliant memo every time
7634488 heres what youre doing right heres what youre doing wrong and heres what your competitors are doing better than you
7634489 a real sense of urgency is rare much rarer than most people seem to think
7634490 a big reason that a true sense of urgency is rare is that it is not a natural state of affairs it has to be created and re created

7634523 when it comes specifically to hiv aids the most important prevention is education which should include which should include abstinence education and teaching the children teaching children you know that sex is not something casual but it should also include it should also include other you know information about contraception because look ive got two daughters 9 years old and 6 years old i am going to teach them first of all about values and morals but if they make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby i dont want them punished with an std at the age of 16 you know so it doesnt make sense to not give them information
7634524 the artist has to look at everything as though he saw it for the first time he has to look at life as he did when he was a child the first step toward creation is to see everything as it really is and that demands a constant effort
7634525 however as almost every previous similar study has shown patients who received stents were nearly 5 times as likely to require subsequent interventions to clear and open re clogged coronary arteries after stenting when compared to the patients that had their narrowed coronary arteries completely bypassed by cabg surgery
7634526 when the fda approved a new kind of cardiac stent coated with time release drugs to keep newly opened arteries from reclogging with plaque many saw the stents as a miracle now cardiologists are debating whether the stents when improperly used might put patients at greater risk of blood clots heart attacks even death
7634527 two thirds of the stents that are placed nowadays are not properly deployed
7634528 the drug eluting stent is extremely safe and the number of patients who are adversely affected is less than 1 percent
7634529 its important to prevent renarrowing putting in drug coated stents prevents the re narrowing of arteries at the small cost of possible late clotting
7634530 with bare metal stents the risk of clotting takes place in the first two to four weeks
7634531 with drug eluding stents the risk happens late six months to two years later
7634532 its important to remember that in all circumstances studied so far drug eluting stents have been shown to be more effective than bare metal stents with less risk of restenosis and the associated risk of more procedures keep in mind that compared to bare metal stents drug eluting stents dramatically reduce the chances your arteries will become clogged again
7634533 this study is worthy of note because it shows a significant advantage for drug eluting stents over bare metal stents with lower rates of death and heart attack as well as lower rates of re intervention
7634534 these findings are consistent with results shown in the taxus clinical program and suggest further that the benefit of drug eluting stents may be even greater in real world patients
7634535 despite this benefit antiplatelet therapy is sometimes prematurely discontinued within the first year after stent implantation
7634536 death rates due to presumed or documented stent thrombosis range from 20 percent to 45 percent

7634550 many people sustain simply on corn alone when they begin to feel ill they will seek herbal remedies from herbs gathered in the hills they will then slaughter either a goat or sheep and boil the meat and herbs into a stew the stew is the consumed for a minimum of three days but for a more serious infection it can be up to one month ten goats or sheep may be slaughtered during this one month

7634554 everyone should come to minneapolis its the most beautiful city in the united states
7634555 i heard that the republican national convention is coming to town and im wondering if its being held here at the convention center
7634556 no its actually not its going to be in st paul
7634557 but ive been here since 1987 i know minneapolis better because this is where i landed when i got off the plane
7634558 whenever ive gone over to st paul it just looks older the people are older the buildings are older
7634559 if youre looking for paul anka and have to have his gold album we can sell you two of them
7634560 i bet you in st paul they dont have any of those
7634561 the smush bush doll here a little anger management system would sell equally well to the conservative crowd as it would to the liberal crowd
7634562 used to be a shot and a beer years ago now its not
7634563 we do a lot of martinis but its more of a blue collar town
7634564 there are more murders in minneapolis and the people in st paul are brought up better they look better and there are nicer people in st paul
7634565 i think being small minded is not a good quality to have
7634566 i think you have to open up and realize what an incredible community st paul is im in a mixed marriage i married someone from minneapolis
7634567 i would definitely raise a family here in my own personal opinion i go to minneapolis to party and go to st paul to sleep
7634568 the one on the right is the minnehaha window thats the older of the two made in 1893 by the tiffany studios in new york
7634569 the minnehaha window was actually commissioned by the state of minnesota and was used in the 1893 columbian exposition in chicago as part of the minnesota pavilion
7634570 one of the reasons duluth has such an incredible vast treasure of tiffany windows is the fact that anne weston lived here and designed windows for churches
7634571 in this case for the library and other buildings around duluth
7634572 oviously these are desperate times for the city of duluth and desperate measures are needed
7634573 im not totally enthused about losing such a beautiful treasure i refer to it as selling the family jewels
7634574 and some of the things that we have in our possession arent necessarily things that we should have in our possession
7634575 as an example christies will be doing an exclusive tiffany sale in new york later this year

7634578 are they going to sell off the chandeliers theyre part of the building theyve been there forever
7634579 we will be at that council meeting and speak against it as will other organizations that care
7634580 and i hope citizens also come out for this to speak when all is said and done all we can do is voice our opinion hope that they would either take it off the block or at least table it and think about it

7634584 the problems in a polygamist family are first the creation of poverty
7634585 yes in some areas i e education maasais long ago neglected it because of culture children would herd cattle instead of attending school which still happens today
7634586 if i could have married one wife my children could have gone to school but now since i married so many wives my children are not even getting enough food
7634587 as the dispensary chairman and a leader in the community we are discouraging polygamist families since it is creating poverty we would also like to have adult education in family planning and the use of contraceptives both oral and injectable and also educating people on other ways of earning a living rather than keeping cattle
7634588 if it would be possible for us to get the seeds for planting i e corn and education on proper farming there is great potential for success also plows that can be powered by ox or donkey would go great lengths

7634649 speko vroeg dus om technisch onderzoek maar de telecomwaakhond wist niet hoe dat moest beweert arjen jongeling directeur van speko
7634650 speko had aanwijzingen dat activisten het bedrijf in diskrediet wilden brengen door berichten uit spekos naam te versturen het bedrijf vroeg dus om technisch onderzoek maar de telecomwaakhond wist niet hoe dat moest
7634651 het bedrijf speko dat eind 2005 aan de schandpaal werd genageld wint een hoger beroepszaak tegen opta en hoeft een spamboete niet te betalen
7634652 arjen jongeling is ten onrechte beboet wegens verzending van spam
7634653 de rechter heeft de opta teruggefloten voor wat betreft het opleggen van een boete voor spam
7634654 volgens arjen jongeling directeur van speko zijn de spamjagers over de schreef gegaan
7634655 speko directeur arjen jongeling is opgelucht over de uitspraak en laat weten veel last van de schuldigverklaring door opta te hebben gehad
7634656 we vonden het raar dat men enerzijds bij ons onder politiebegeleiding het halve kantoor leeghaalde en anderzijds de klagers op de blauwe ogen geloofde aldus arjen jongeling
7634657 speko directeur arjen jongeling legde zich echter niet bij de boetes neer volgens hem heeft opta niet bewezen dat de e mails daadwerkelijk naar particulieren zijn verzonden
7634658 volgens speko heeft de opta te weinig forensisch onderzoek gedaan de rechter gaf het bedrijf gelijk
7634659 de opta heeft arjen jongeling ten onrechte beboet voor het verzenden van spam
7634660 telecomautoriteit opta heeft het bedrijf speko ten onrechte een boete van 60 000 euro opgelegd wegens het versturen van spam
7634661 overigens bleek alleen al uit die lijst dat het onderzoek rammelde aangezien sommige adressen toch van bedrijven bleken te zijn of niet tot een persoon herleidbaar waren aldus jongeling
7634662 laten ze nu voortaan maar eens hun zaken goed regelen bij de opta er zijn teveel gedupeerden waarvan later blijkt dat de boete niet correct was
7634663 tijdens de rechtzaak kwam echter naar voren dat de opta eigenlijk niet wist hoe je via proxies de verzendende computer kunt opsporen
7634664 arjen jongeling is ten onrechte beboet wegens verzending van spam

7634670 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7634671 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7634672 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

7634704 consider the history of such empires as the roman the ottoman and more recently the soviet to think that a new alexander the great will be born and raise the macedonian empire from the grave is an impossible dream an illusion a plot for a science fiction novel to speak of another golden age of armenian literature and culture in our context is not optimism but megalomania run amok let us therefore be more realistic shall we let us aim at common sense and decency

7634707 free at last free at last thank god almighty i am free at last to make an ass of myself
7634708 please be gentle with them they are my bread and butter i need them the way a garbage collector needs garbage
7634709 after reading you i feel ashamed of being an armenian
7634710 had no desire to learn he wanted to become a hero
7634711 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7634712 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7634713 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7634714 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in europe and fighting the japanese in the pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the
7634715 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7634716 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7634717 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience
7634718 armenia was always in favor of dialogue and talks particularly on the issues concerning cooperation and security in our region the turkish prime ministers statement on the intention to start talks with armenia on this agenda could be welcomed
7634719 during the conversation mr babacan conveyed our concrete proposals concerning the caucasia stability and cooperation platform to the russian side
7634720 osce the organization for security and co operation in europe is ineffective in regards to the nagorno karabakh issue since russia is one of the co chairs in the osce minsk group if such a caucasia platform is established russias participation in this body is inevitable and if turkey can get russia and georgia together under the same roof then this will be a success by itself
7634721 both russia and georgia do not want to give up south ossetia and abkhazia at the same time however there may be a bargaining on the two regions while georgia will definitely be very stubborn as it considers both of the regions its own soil on the other side there is a deep lack of confidence vis vis russia a lack of confidence which makes expectation of great consequences from this platform in the short run very difficult russias main goal was to topple saakashvili with its recent move it would either walk to tbilisi in order to enter the capital or it would force georgia to give major concessions like withdrawing half of its troops from the disputed regions nevertheless none took place and it seems saakashvili will remain in power for a considerable time thus russia couldnt reach its eventual goal
7634722 what could happen is this the parties come together around the same table and they can take steps regarding secondary issues related to nagorno karabakh for example the refugee issue in the long run russia has a tendency to introduce the issues of nagorno karabakh south ossetia and abkhazia in one package which will not be acceptable for a large majority of the international community because the situation in nagorno karabakh is entirely different from all others since armenia is de facto on azerbaijan soil via invading nagorno karabakh following the unilateral declaration of kosovos independence and its recognition by the world russia has become increasingly aggressive concerning the issue of nagorno karabakh but it is impossible to put these issues in the same file neither geographically nor historically can this be done even looking at the significant differences of population between kosovo and these regions make this point clear
7634723 we also have this triangle of caucasia the united states and turkey the us is actually looking favorably at all kinds of moves of rapprochement between turkey and armenia yet a significant step by armenia is not easy to be taken in the short term due to the clout of the hard liner karabakh clan with the leadership of the country as a matter of fact turkeys conditions for reopening the border and re establishing diplomatic relations are quite moderate
7634724 if someone has a better idea then s he should come forward and tell us this better idea
7634725 such an initiative could not be taken without having russias consent and turkey gained this consent nobody takes initiatives with consequences or success being taken for granted as there is always a calculated risk when turkey initiated the black sea economic cooperation back in the early 1990s the same kinds of comments were made suggesting that the idea was not realistic at all but it took off later it lost its vigorousness due to neglect by the governments of the time starting from 1996
7634726 unfortunately the coalition government led by late prime minister b lent ecevit and the next president ahmet necdet sezer neglected the idea put forward by demirel purely on political concerns since it was not first floated by them and it failed before it was born
7634727 when governments give clear signals about their priorities the people of turkey read this message and act accordingly and make the necessary sacrifices falling on their shoulders in the case of the absence of clear signals and messages extreme ideas such as turkey joining the shanghai five or its establishing a new front with iran and russia gain currency in the town
7634728 but now it needs sustainable power and it cannot rely forever and solely upon the ups and downs in natural gas prices to maintain its power
7634729 i find comments suggesting that a new cold war era has started as exaggerated but it is obvious that the cards are being redistributed and that this is happening putting forward constructive and positive ideas as ankara has been doing is extremely good
7634730 the fact that this idea has not been rejected spells that it will be able to stand on its own feet even if these five countries come together and set a date for their second meeting without making a concrete decision over disputed issues this will be a real success
7634731 i hadnt been briefed that that was going to happen we have a partnership with turkey on the caucasus and i presume that well be able to work together very closely now with our allies in turkey since we do have clearly shared interests not to mention values throughout the caucasus with our turkish ally
7634732 russias actions in gori led to an environment of cold war and washington was actually not expecting such action by russia which fuelled already existing doubts over moscows respect for georgias sovereignty all of these facts might have led to such a distanced manner by the united states however in the long term this platform is also in the interest of the united states
7634733 then we were discussing the involvement of the united states and iran in the issue today there is no us aspect of the issue at the time being but washington should definitely be persuaded to effectively support this initiative
7634734 the western world in general for example via nato and the united states in particular should be appropriately briefed that their interests in the region will be protected in this regard mr babacans telephone talks are very positive yet i believe that the level should be upgraded with mr prime minister recep tayyip erdogan holding talks with eu term president frances leader nicolas sarkozy as well as with the eus foreign policy chief javier solana
7634735 as we have seen in the recent past turkey has played an important role in the region and we hope that turkeys new efforts to promote stability in the south caucasus will be in harmony with other international efforts to promote peace prosperity and stability in the caucasus including through nato the eu and the osce
7634736 and we look forward to consulting with ankara on its caucasus platform concept
7634737 if president gul visited armenia to monitor the game there will be meetings protests and appeals against turkey
7634738 but this will not be organized only by the dashnaktsutyun
7634739 we have problems with turkey and the solutions of these problems relate to the future rather than the past
7634740 the dashnaktsutyun has always been an independent force in politics and expressed its positions on various issues regardless of what others thought
7634741 as we stated back in january armenian americans a community that is deeply committed to a moral u s foreign policy and constructive american engagement abroad respect senator bidens leadership and today we welcome his addition to the democratic ticket
7634742 i support it and the reason is simple i have found in my experience that you cannot have a solid relationship with a country based on fiction it occurred it occurred
7634743 recognition by the united states of the armenian genocide is not the final goal the real goal is the recognition of turkey of the turkish government of the armenian genocide and the establishment of a common turkish armenian understanding of the events and tragedy that took place
7634744 my mother father big sister we all sing different songs
7634745 we inherited a sense of rhythm and talent for language i performed songs in hems in georgian laz and greek languages in a concert it was my first i was stunned to sing before 5 000 people
7634746 i am from the black sea and i use my revolver whenever
7634747 here is everything you need now it is your turn to make something out of this
7634748 let armenia stop the occupation of karabakh and resign the groundless claims about the genocide turkey must not be ensnared with fake ideas for matters of stability and peace armenia must give up the policy of enmity against ankara and baku
7634749 the controversies with armenia are not of emotional matter there are serious claims of territories and it is ridiculous to make an alliance with that country
7634750 although president abdullah guls visit shall have a great importance and positive consequences the armenian side has not made yet the gesture necessary to make the visit real therefore the most reasonable neutral move is to send sports minister murad baseskioglu to watch the game
7634751 armenia has always advocated dialog and talks especially over issues of cooperation and security in our region
7634752 we welcome the turkish prime ministers statement on the plans to start talks with armenia on these issues
7634753 if the countries in the region do not stand for their joint future the caucasus will not be able to enjoy peace security and prosperity
7634754 iran should be included in the platform both due to the position of parts of its territories in the caucasus and due to the fact that the alliance will be of direct concern for iran the platform should be supported by a number of internationally recognized organizations such as the eu the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce the black sea economic cooperation bsec and the world bank
7634755 it was president abdullah gul who gave the first message to caucasian countries last year regarding the proposed platform he called on armenia to normalize its relations with turkey and azerbaijan and participate in giant energy projects in the region
7634756 turkeys call for an alliance in the region is very important for all caucasian countries turkey may become a leader in a project for peace and development in the region by persuading all regional leaders to contribute to the alliance war will bring no good to the caucasus as it didnt bring any happiness or wealth to the middle east
7634757 the platform will include russia turkey georgia azerbaijan and armenia it will aim to make these five countries discuss matters with one another to me making these countries sit around a table is a great success but i dont believe the platform will even succeed in this i dont expect russia to discuss the caucasian issue with any other country on the one hand if russia decides to recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia the caucasus will be dragged into greater chaos and on the other it will not allow any other country to intervene to help solve the problem thus it is of great importance to closely follow developments in the region
7634758 the tradition of humanitarian intervention once ran deep in world politics
7634759 that the russian ambassador had told him that russia did not care a pin for bulgaria or bosnia
7634760 turkey is playing its first game in the group preliminaries of the world cup with armenia in yerevan on sept 6 2008 armenian president serzh sarksyan has invited turkish president abdullah g l to yerevan to see the game this game is a great opportunity to normalize relations between turkey and armenia
7634761 fans traveling from turkey to see the game have two options for getting to yerevan the first is by air which is very expensive and where it will be hard to find a free seat second is going to georgia by road which takes only half an hour from igdir to yerevan
7634762 we just want to see the game and then return home
7634763 they have been invited to this to help resolve problems talks and preparations are still under way
7634764 by its decisive interference russia has rescued the south ossetian people from genocide
7634765 the tragic events in south ossetia proved that such conflicts should be settled on the basis of peoples free will otherwise we will inevitably witness ethnic separatism and violation of the norms of international humanitarian law
7634766 azerbaijan and the world society should recognize the independence of nagorno karabakh otherwise russia will enter its troops and force azerbaijan to peace
7634767 heranus and her brothers clung to their mothers skirts but though she was terrified she was desperate to know what was going on
7634768 reconcile us with our history but also to reconcile us with ourselves
7634769 this is our holiest shrine our grandparents who perished in the genocide do not have marked graves this is where we remember them
7634770 a sad shepherd on the mountain played a song of love
7634771 she loved to dance but after her ordeal she never danced again
7634772 we shall repair the cross again and again no matter how often it is desecrated
7634773 turkey wants to push azerbaijan towards compromise and also make sure armenia plays more pragmatic role this is the vision behind the caucasus platform idea of erdogan
7634774 if the west manages to push russia out of caucasus then the idea of the common caucasus home might be possible if russia stays in the region then not
7634775 armenia was always in favor of dialogue and talks particularly on the issues concerning cooperation and security in our region
7634776 the turkish prime ministers statement on the intention to start talks with armenia on this agenda could be welcomed
7634777 do i think that the idea to promote regional cooperation in the region is a good one and that turkey has a role to play here
7634778 the answer is yes but this particular proposal is not the way to approach it in a general sense i would agree that turkey has a role to play and needs to be more active
7634779 we are ready to discuss with turkey all kinds of regional initiatives but at this stage there is no possibility that we enter any cooperation mechanism with russia as long as the occupation goes on and a single occupying soldier stays on my soil
7634780 after occupying forces leave and all of those people who were forced out of their houses go back then we will start talking and discussing future probabilities and possibilities but again i can assure that the territorial integrity of georgia will maintain
7634781 can you imagine georgia being in any kind of regional group with russia when it has just invaded that country and still has troops on its soil this is like inviting the fox in the hen house
7634782 i have to take that with a great deal of skepticism
7634783 i can imagine a regional grouping between turkey plus the caucasus countries azerbaijan armenia and georgia of course even then it would be difficult without some kind of regulation of relations with armenia i cannot imagine even azerbaijan is too interested especially now helping a regional partnership with russia
7634784 i think that whats great about the turkish initiative is that mr erdogan is one of the few people who have talked to all of these people as a neutral person i think thats more important than the substance of the caucasus stability and cooperation pact
7634785 we will discuss the project with armenia to construct a cooperation region with five countries
7634786 early measures to resolve frozen problems in the region and prevent instability in the future
7634787 this is our understanding on all problems we are no enemy to anyone in the region
7634788 armenia occupied a chunk of azerbaijan in a war over nagorno karabakh
7634789 we may not have diplomatic ties but turkey recognizes armenia
7634790 we have vital interests in securing durable peace and stability in the region
7634791 said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan at a press conference thursday august 14 upon his return from a trip to moscow and tbilisi
7634792 next week the platform will be discussed during a visit to baku
7634793 we hope that azerbaijan will accept both the new platform of cooperation that will help find solutions to ethnic conflicts in the region
7634794 of course the minsk process is underway in the region
7634795 said erdogan at a joint press conference with mr saakashivili
7634796 we want to establish an economic cooperation and it leads to cooperation for regional peace and security
7634797 we also want this institution is responsible for managing the crisis and seek solutions to any problem in the region
7634798 the russian tanks rumbling across parts of georgia are forcing a fundamental reassessment of strategic interests across europe in a way not considered since the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 and the subsequent collapse of communism
7634799 washington and european capitals had encouraged liberalization in lands once firmly under the soviet aegis
7634800 farther west in poland american negotiators thursday dropped resistance to giving the poles advanced patriot missiles in exchange for stationing parts of a missile defense system there that system the americans insist is intended to deflect attack from iran
7634801 the russian ambassador to nato dmitri rogozin was not the only member of the russian military and political leadership who saw things differently
7634802 the fact that this was signed in a period of a very difficult crisis in the relationship between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will not be deployed against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
7634803 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
7634804 for the first time since 1991 russia has used military force against a sovereign state in the post soviet area the world will not be the same a new phenomenon is unfolding in front or our eyes a re emerging power that is willing to use force to guarantee it interests the west does not know how to respond
7634805 at stake 20 years ago was whether the kremlin then under mikhail gorbachev would intervene militarily to stop the collapse of communism but gorbachev chose to cut eastern europe free as he focused in vain on preventing the collapse of the soviet union itself
7634806 communist bloc lands from the baltic states in the north to bulgaria in the south have since joined the european union and nato a feat despite flaws that in the western view has made the continent more secure and democratic
7634807 but russia never liked the expansion of nato in the 1990s it was too weak to resist today in the caucasus russia is showing off its power and sending an unmistakable message georgia or much larger ukraine will never be allowed to join nato
7634808 the implications of russias action reverberate well beyond that from the european unions muddled relations with its key energy supplier russia through armenia and azerbaijan in the south to ukraine and moldova
7634809 this region has everything the west and russia both covet and abhor immense reserves of oil and gas innumerable ethnic splits and tensions corrupt and authoritarian regimes pockets of territory which have become breeding grounds or safe havens for islamic fundamentalists
7634810 the eu as ever slow and divided has offered few concrete proposals in order to bring the countries of what russia calls its
7634811 the emergency meeting this week of eu foreign ministers showed just how divided they were analysts say it is because the 27 member states have not been able to separate their view of russia from adopting a clear strategy towards the former soviet republics on the eus new eastern borders
7634812 the georgia crisis shows that russia is in the process of testing how far it can go
7634813 this is part of a much bigger geopolitical game it is time for the europeans to decide what kind of influence it wants in the former soviet states that is the biggest strategic challenge the eu now faces
7634814 nato led by the u s and several east european countries has reached out more actively at a summit meeting in bucharest in april georgia and ukraine failed to get on a concrete path to membership as they had sought but did secure a promise of joining eventually
7634815 georgia and its supporters say that nato membership would have protected georgians from russian tanks
7634816 the newly resurgent russians buoyed by oil and gas wealth and the firm leadership of vladimir putin have played their hand with less hesitation
7634817 tomas valasek the slovak born director of foreign policy and defense at the center for european reform in london says russia has used the ethnic and territorial card in order to persuade some nato countries that admitting ukraine or georgia would prove more dangerous and unstable than keeping them out
7634818 recognize kosovos break with serbia putin warned last spring and russia will feel entitled to do the same with south ossetia and georgias other breakaway enclave abkhazia where putin needs stability in order to realize his cherished project of the 2014 winter olympics in nearby sochi
7634819 ukraine bigger than france and traditionally seen by russians as integral to their heritage and dominion has been conspicuously quiet over the past week
7634820 they are very concerned about the crimea and the energy situation ahead of the winter
7634821 in the case of crimea yushchenko signed a decree that would impose further controls over access to the port of sevastopol where the russian black sea fleet is based russia has insisted it would keep the fleet there despite a 1997 agreement between moscow and kiev to end the lease in 2017
7634822 senior ukrainian officials say that the weak eu response on georgia will only embolden russia to focus even more on ukraine where many inhabitants speak russian and particularly in the eastern half look to moscow not kiev for leadership
7634823 the crisis in georgia has clear implications for regional security and of course ukraine
7634824 this crisis makes crystal clear that the security vacuums that have existed in the post soviet space remain dangerous
7634825 the eu and u s cannot take their eyes off ukraine now russia will do everything possible to ensure that nato will not offer ukraine the chance to start accession talks in december
7634826 as for georgias eastern neighbor azerbaijan energy and ethnic tensions provide ample fodder for strategic dispute
7634827 but it is the unresolved status of nagorno karabakh an armenian enclave in azerbaijan which explains why president ilham aliyev of azerbaijan has been measured in his response to the crisis in georgia
7634828 we know that russia is involved in nagorno karabakh aliyev does not want to provoke russia by trying to change the status quo of the enclave if he tried to do so it could cause a big russian reaction
7634829 visitors to the museum will come to understand the armenian genocide as the prototype for modern crimes against humanity including the holocaust cambodia rwanda and darfur
7634830 if president gul visits armenia to watch the game there will be meetings protests and calls against turkey
7634831 we have problems with turkey and solutions to those problems relate to the future rather than the past

7634856 its hopeful to see the presidential contenders from both parties responding to the widespread public outrage over the problem of excessive executive pay but their solutions fall short both support boosting shareholder power over executive compensation this reform known as say on pay could shame some boards away from offering truly obscene pay packages but it has had limited effect in other countries real executive pay reform demands tougher legislative action and step one should be to plug the tax loopholes that currently encourage and subsidize runaway pay we need to be asking our lawmakers how much longer are you going to allow our tax dollars to wind up in the pockets of top executives
7634857 senators barack obama and john mccain both propose greater shareholder say over ceo pay
7634858 but when it comes to taking real action to close the loopholes that subsidize these obscene reckless and super sized salaries neither candidate is aggressive enough

7634864 the first thing i noticed about chris on that flight back from athens was his complete humility about everything he had done
7634865 he spoke all the time about the support he had received and how he was the tip of the iceberg that started with his familys love and support and the input of everybody concerned with team gb
7634866 ive had the very best support and back up in the world
7634867 on the way home from athens chris was already looking ahead to beijing
7634868 i was lucky in that my event was over early and i spent most of the last week celebrating each gb medal and accumulating quite a hangover
7634869 as far as im concerned every olympics is your first olympics you have to clock on afresh every time and leave your last games far behind nothing ive done in the past will count for anything in london or rather weymouth which is going to be a stunning sailing venue with a lot of breeze and exciting action
7634870 winning an olympic title in front of my home crowd would be the ultimate
7634871 i couldnt have trained an ounce harder for these olympics if theyd paid me a million pounds it makes no difference
7634872 it would be a nice bonus and help pay some of the bills but that could never be my motivation
7634873 i wont be changing much london 2012 is enough motivation in itself i dont really need any interim goals between now and then but i do need to let my body recover first and catch up with family and friends im based down at manchester and havent had a chance to get home more than four or five times this season and have hardly seen my girlfriend sarra it can be hard and thats why olympic medals are for everyone involved to enjoy

7634877 the fact that the mdc won despite these tactics is certainly an important psychological victory for them and a big blow for mugabe

7634890 i dont think we could have contributed in any other way to exciting the nation about us becoming the next hosts of the olympic games in 2012
7634891 the whole country has woken up to the fact its us next and it is going to be a hell of a show in london in 2012
7634892 all of us will be back in training in a months time back to the real world and the hard graft
7634893 but it is only going to help to spur the rest of the team on to keep training through the next four years up until the london olympics
7634894 it is so timely we were able to get this result now and do so well and get the nation really behind the games
7634895 in my experience that will make the difference between london being a great games or not how the british public will react to it
7634896 you saw in sydney how the australians got behind the 2000 games and you saw a fantastic home performance by their team and again in china it is great to get home to such a reception and now the next four years hard work start now
7634897 from what ive seen there is so much money and facilities and great coaching and support staff coming into britain and helping us out i dont see how it can get worse
7634898 can i ask you something what does she look like
7634899 i get frightened when that dark cloud comes over me it leaves me not knowing where i am
7634900 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7634901 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7634902 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7634903 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7634904 lately people are realizing that there may be a whole other leg of this credit market fallout that they havent anticipated yet
7634905 youre seeing a rolling problem that started two years ago in the mortgage business and we havent touched the bottom of the swimming pool in terms of the housing market
7634906 between all these factors i dont think you can make the argument that the broad market is at a compelling place to get in

7634950 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7634951 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7634952 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7634953 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7634954 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7634955 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7634956 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7634957 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7634958 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7634959 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7634960 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7634961 clinton herself has suggested that the party needs a cathartic moment to cleanse any remaining bad blood between the two camps
7634962 if the obama can come out of denver with even a little more enthusiasm from clinton supporters it will be a victory
7634963 we love the underdog the brits but when you drill down deep into the psyche of the individual we want to be winners

7635009 another aspect of this tragedy nobody is discussing is the fact that those living in immigrant communities are the ones most likely to be victimized by these hardened criminals why arent the mayors taking that into account and where is the news media on that aspect of this issue

7635022 i know all eyes are on denver right now but were excited and were getting ready to host the 2008 republican national convention here in minneapolis st paul
7635023 weve created a fun filled menu that blends political savvy with minnesota favorites like apples and cheddar cheese and a tremendous green environment hotel wide well have the new york and wisconsin delegations with us and while their republican solidarity is a given they may scrimmage a bit over who owns football rights to brett favre were looking at a special area of our lobby or bar to accommodate that contest
7635024 weve got our special brand of service and our entire team of people here at the hotel ready to impress and deliver on every need and desire the hotel has to be perfect so that nothing stands in the way of the politics at hand
7635025 and of course we plan a few surprises that will delight the delegates
7635026 if president bush does what no world leader has ever done before fully protect these colossal areas of shallow and deep coral reefs seamounts and other vulnerable marine ecosystems in the pacific ocean now and forever
7635027 two years ago president bush shook the world when he made the northwestern hawaiian islands a marine national monument and what was then the worlds largest no take marine reserve
7635028 he gifted americans and the world by protecting life in an incredible area of ocean 1 200 miles long and 100 miles wide
7635029 if the president ultimately acts to protect these amazing areas of ocean to the fullest extent
7635030 his conservation legacy will rival that of president teddy roosevelt leadership in protecting our planet can and must come from republicans and democrats alike
7635031 the fate of our oceans is far more important than partisan politics
7635032 by using his presidential powers under the antiquities act and other statutes to fully protect ocean areas like he did in hawaii president bush could write a new chapter in the history of conservation
7635033 this could be the best thing ever for ocean conservation these vast pacific areas are nearly three times the size of texas
7635034 indeed theyre bigger than mexico countless seabirds dolphins fishes corals and tiny things as yet undiscovered could survive as a result free of the threats that are eliminating them elsewhere if the president gives full protection to these areas i am thrilled that president bush is considering this
7635035 but we got about to the jetty and he just dropped
7635036 he looked like he was in rough shape he had no pulse and was not breathing
7635037 i was just focused right on providing compressions and ventilations and shocking him so i was just hoping this guy would pull through
7635038 we worked as a team it was definitely a team effort and everybody took their part in saving mr paquettes life

7635041 if it wasnt for all of them he wouldnt be here the efforts of the lifeguards the troopers they got him out of the water got him back to life theyre the real heroes

7635043 to see him today and his wife a tremendous feeling its great
7635044 youll see folks in no uncertain terms lay down exactly the differences between barack obama and john mccain
7635045 make sure the know who barack obama is and where hes going to take this country and let people know the crystal clear choice between obama who wants to fundamentally change business as usual in washington and john mccain who is just more of the same
7635046 he either forgot how many houses he has misplaced the keys to those houses or he just wasnt being truthful with those reporters
7635047 weve got members who are losing are homes and he cant even keep track
7635048 in the weeks ahead lets be optimists not just opponents lets build unity in the american family not angry division lets honor this nations diversity lets respect one another
7635049 our overall advice to candidates has been to stay home

7635059 the company has offered full assistance to the authorities in helping those affected and the local community
7635060 all i can say is that were following every lead and were obviously looking at the windfarm as a possible source of the start of the landslide
7635061 the river feale has continually produced good stocks of salmon so any blow to that would be very severe in the national terms
7635062 quite frankly some of the people that i had most previously admired as commentators i have a remarkably different opinion toward right now
7635063 he is running for the most important office in the world
7635064 all the clubs from the big leagues have been watching him
7635065 so far what i can say is that nobody from newcastle has come to me
7635066 he is very ambitious and if newcastle came to us with an offer then we would have to seriously consider it

7635071 this is the most talented team we have had from top to bottom since i have been here
7635072 i think our kicking game is really good i think our kicker is the best in the country obviously you know he has kicked some 70 yard field goals in practice weve got our snapper our holder and our punter back
7635073 the reason why we initially scheduled buffalo was to have a game we could play before the texas game so we could warm up
7635074 i was in favor of playing this game on thursday because it gives us 10 days to prepare for our next opponent
7635075 ever since ive been here every high school coach in the city has told me they have another robert rodriguez
7635076 i think turner gill has done a great job at buffalo their talent level is so much better than it was three years ago and he has molded their quarterback into a pro prospect turner is from houston so there are some texas kids on that team too
7635077 my thinking is that we should actually try to do things with a social network that is we should consider the social network the model by which we do things

7635090 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7635091 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7635092 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression of the thirties and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7635093 we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7635094 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better
7635095 very much one of financial caution as regards the next year
7635096 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7635097 but the important thing is people realise this is just a transitory period of subdued of growth and we will get through the other side and growth will resume to more normal levels
7635098 to have perfectly safe water we would have to put a cover over the whole lake

7635108 hearing on radio frequency weapons and proliferation potential impact on the economy
7635109 during the cold war the united states not only engaged in a relatively open nuclear arms race with the soviet union but also engaged in a secret race developing unconventional weapons
7635110 and as the us intelligence community began to grow a secret culture sprang about which enabled the intelligence players to implement the various developed techniques to cleverly circumvent the democratic processes and institutions
7635111 like many other democracies the us government is made up of two basic parts the elected constituency i e the various governors judges congressmen and the president and the unelected bureaucracies as represented by the numerous federal agencies
7635112 in a well balanced and correctly functioning democracy the elected part of the government is in charge of its unelected bureaucratic part giving the people a real voice in the agenda set by their government
7635113 while a significant part of the us government no doubt follows this democratic principle a considerable portion of the us government operates in complete secrecy and follows its own unaccountable agenda which unacknowledged very often is quite different from the public agenda
7635114 we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions added to this three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defence establishment we annually spend on military security more than the net income of all united states corporations
7635115 this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the american experience
7635116 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or our democratic processes

7635120 on the possibility of directly accessing every human brain by electromagnetic induction of fundamental algorithms
7635121 contemporary neuroscience suggests the existence of fundamental algorithms by which all sensory transduction is translated into an intrinsic brain specific code direct stimulation of these codes within the human temporal or limbic cortices by applied electromagnetic patterns may require energy levels which are within the range of both geomagnetic activity and contemporary communication networks a process which is coupled to the narrow band of brain temperature could allow all normal human brains to be affected by a subharmonic whose frequency range at about 10 hz would only vary by 0 1 hz
7635122 within the last two decades a potential has emerged which was improbable but which is now marginally feasible
7635123 the historical emergence of such possibilities which have ranged from gunpowder to atomic fission have resulted in major changes in the social evolution that occurred inordinately quickly after the implementation reduction of the risk of the inappropriate application of these technologies requires the continued and open discussion of their realistic feasibility and implications within the scientific and public domain

7635232 the only way to get rid of jinnah was a divided india any form of a united india would start a civil war
7635233 anti communalism was not one sided he fought muslim communalism no less valiantly
7635234 unless muslims are made to feel that they are as much an integral part of india as hindus their attachment to secularism would remain hypocritical

7635248 things are different now the contemporary church is often a weak ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound it is so often the arch supporter of the status quo far from being disturbed by the presence of the church the power structure of the average community is consoled by the churchs silent and often vocal sanction of things as they are but the judgment of god is upon the church as never before if the church of today does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church it will lose its authentic ring forfeit the loyalty of millions and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century i am meeting young people every day whose disappointment with the church has risen to outright disgust maybe again i have been too optimistic is organized religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world maybe i must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church the church within the church as the true ecclesia and the hope of the world

7635324 it was different back then you would contact people like ibm and ask if you could use their computing power or phone lines linking other computers after office hours the community was so small that no one abused it it was self policing and it worked it was a privilege
7635325 first we did a bit of dumpster diving looking in their trash to find out who their computer company was
7635326 then i paid a visit posing as one of their technicians and got access to the companys servers i secretly installed a wireless network behind a desk while i was there which allowed ryan who was in a car outside to begin hacking into their computer system remotely
7635327 the owner was pissed off when he came in the next morning but then he realised that he ought to take better advice over his security
7635328 when i was a kid i used to do some dark stuff mostly trying to get free phone or internet time and i was charged over it twice although i have no record the thing is today a black hat hacker could do so much damage to a company or to an individual if they didnt have their computer security up to date there is so much money to be made out there these days for me i think growing up and having two sons changed me and made me more responsible i still get to face tough hacking challenges but now i do it for good reasons
7635329 then they just said it was a bug then they began to realise just how potentially damaging this could all be after that it was amazing to see how everyone worked together to find a temporary solution to the problem it isnt completely fixed yet but it will be and a year or so down the line the internet will be more secure than it has ever been i feel very proud to have played a part in that
7635330 when defcon started we used to see it as a nuisance sixteen years on our view has changed once a year all the knowledge out there is pooled and it allows us to see where the next threats are coming from these guys have become our eyes and ears
7635331 it is the glory of god to keep a matter hidden but it is the glory of kings to search out that matter
7635332 did you know that sometimes god will hide a thing from us not because he wants it to stay hidden but because he wants you to find it
7635333 you want this you really really wanna know about this well show me how badly you want it and come and get it i did it for you i wanted you so badly that i sent my son to brutally die to pay the debt of your sin if you want more come and get it and show me how much it means to you and how much you really trust me
7635334 search me out with a loud sound and invite me and i will uncover important and intense secrets inaccessible things and mysteries of which you have never seen or been instructed before
7635335 the future of america is as good as its schools
7635336 algo a tener en cuenta es que los comentarios que contengan enlaces con invitaciones a registrarse al mismo tema que propone mas efectivo son considerados como spam
7635337 innovation has been a key to apples success over the past decade and without it the company would be nothing more than another computer vendor
7635338 but by releasing a mac that eclipses the functionality of the tablet pc and fully harnesses the power of multitouch in a way that no one has seen before apple can create the computing worlds first iphone like success
7635339 why apple and not dell or hp its simple apple is the only company in the market thats willing to risk failure to be the most innovative and beloved company in the space on top of that apple is the only company in that market that truly has a pulse on the desires of most consumers
7635340 that would be an ideal situation for service delivery whether its fire ems police or garbage collection
7635341 if this potential merger does go through and at this point it is only an if it would become the second largest fire department in hamilton county serving more than 100 000 people second only to the city of cincinnati
7635342 a cooperative effort doesnt always generate economies of scale some communities will find in this study that they are really delivering quality fire and ems at high efficiency level other communities may see that if they can find the right mix of communities to come together that this would be something positive for them
7635343 your site is amazing i love photography too hopefully i can learn a thing or two from you
7635344 you are an excellent professional and your blog is very special with great photos a hug from brazil
7635345 i dont understand your language but the photographs of your blog are very nice
7635346 you take beautiful photos i really enjoyed visiting your site thanks for sharing it with me
7635347 thanks for dropping by keep up with those great shots
7635348 well i saw a police car here and he was talking to some people
7635349 and i just happened to notice those two monuments knocked over there
7635350 id like to get my hands on these characters as far as im concerned theyre the scum of the earth
7635351 and for somebody to go in and disturb a cemetery in such a way its devastating
7635352 i hope they catch them i have no respect for them
7635353 and i think something must be done to stop this from happening
7635354 tis event is not being put on by google they are a sponsor but not the organizer of the event check out
7635355 its just a 300 million example of a company that cannot lose gracefully so they will lose
7635356 the industry is completely devoted to this effort to unburn their house its gone fellas give it
7635357 i also want to send a greeting to chelsea fans who in the last two years always made me feel their support thanks really for this
7635358 every time we graduate a couple of classes through the national training university every time we think were getting to a reasonable manning level where people could get some time off they say look heres another cap requirement and we go right back to being undermanned again
7635359 flying uavs hasnt been established yet as a career field
7635360 as it stands right now a lot of people who were only expecting to do three years are effectively not able to leave so that we can grow
7635361 its possible that they may not ever go back to their f 16s when they showed up that was their expectation that they would go back thats a tough fix
7635362 i continue to believe musharraf has done a pretty good job
7635363 benazir bhutto and sharif presided over failed states there was corruption there was a failed state in pakistan when musharraf took charge
7635364 a president who has acted in an anti democratic fashion
7635365 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7635366 dont post about peoples personal sexual or marital problems or about how 9 11 was obviously a bush conspiracy
7635367 here was a candidate for the presidency of the united states asked for his position on one of the central moral and legal questions of our time and this was the best he could offer
7635368 listening to my opponent at saddleback you would never know that this is a politician who long since left behind any middle ground on the abortion issue
7635369 for a man who talks so often about hope senator obama doesnt offer much of it in meeting this great challenge to the conscience of america
7635370 his extreme advocacy in favor of partial birth abortion and his refusal to provide medical care for babies surviving abortion should be of grave concern to reasonable people of goodwill on both sides of this issue
7635371 there was already a law in place in illinois that said that you always have to supply life saving treatment to any infant under any circumstances
7635372 theres not a large probability at all of having a deficit this year
7635373 given the short term inflexibility inherent in expenditures it is likely that the government would run its first budgetary deficit in over a decade
7635374 i dont think there is anything in the numbers that would indicate a deficit would be a good bet
7635375 the john mccain of 2000 is not the john mccain of 2008
7635376 i dont know where that man went he has changed his position and given into the far extreme right wing of his party to the point that it is sad in many ways
7635377 folks like john mccain and myself we can afford it we were doing fine then were doing fine now
7635378 it is doubtful that he would have gotten into the naval academy or graduated from it without that
7635379 people would think im nuts if they saw me early in the morning
7635380 i wake up with a big smile because i got another day i give so many thanks because the creator gave me another day
7635381 shipping starts at 7 45 yay logitech ftw gonna use it on some speakers thanks selma amazons

7635385 dining facilities on campuses take up five times more water five times more energy five times more waste per square foot than the dorm
7635386 without the tray it just doesnt give you that i need to go everywhere and fill up my tray and then sit down option
7635387 instead youre saying i like this item on the menu today
7635388 thats how we get to as close to 0 waste as possible
7635389 fundamentally i think consumers have to understand that some of the responsibility lies with them to create less waste
7635390 if we create less waste we dont even have to consider a need for back end technologies like the pulper

7635392 do you really think that no one would perceive there is a bridge over there
7635393 when you treat people like idiots theyll behave like idiots
7635394 this is a fairly advanced course with students who have quite a lot of background
7635395 they are so happy and excited they are in love and this news makes things even better
7635396 brooke and i are thrilled shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for
7635397 seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 perhaps a boy awaits us

7635406 es gibt derzeit einfach zu viel unsicherheit am markt die diese schwankungen verursacht
7635407 a lot of people think the major textbook publishers are against e books
7635408 in our mind this is great because the functionality offered in digital devices is probably more useful in the long run to students than printed books
7635409 we have a strong relationship with amazon were aggregators we offer our materials in any way that our customers would prefer to use them
7635410 the consumer book market is very different from the textbook market
7635411 with textbooks students only buy what they are assigned its a narrow set of titles and you have to have exactly what theyre looking for the bar is higher for any entry in textbook market you need a lot of content
7635412 its very hard to do color the way its used in 90 percent of the textbooks in a biology textbook the minute you lose color you lose real education value ive seen some color prototypes theyre not that bad but the cost hurdles from what i understand are dramatic
7635413 once they get these 20 21 year old kids reading on a kindle i assume theyll have them for life
7635414 theyll pay for the device out of their college funds and then theyll keep it for pleasure reading for years and years after
7635415 by next summer there should be four solid readers in the market
7635416 to power off or leave powered on that is the question
7635417 we have a nationwide neighborhood volunteer program where we have one volunteer knock on 25 doors three times each to establish that personal connection and relay the importance of voting
7635418 but i understand that in oregon instead of one person knocking on 25 doors three times you have one person knocking on 40 doors four times
7635419 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls
7635420 joe biden is a strong leader on national defense and he understands the challenges of todays working families

7635447 we are excited to work with sylvania computers to grow an emerging class of compact easy to use devices that connect to the internet called netbook computers
7635448 the intel atom processor provides sylvanias new netbook with an optimal balance of low power consumption performance and advanced functionality
7635449 we are very pleased to be featuring ubuntu netbook remix on the latest addition to the sylvania g series of netbooks providing users with an os that just works and which allows users to get online more quickly and have faster access to their favorite applications

7635453 i know a lot of people have asked the question as to what is the cost to russia theres been costs in terms of their reputation theres costs in terms of the ability and willingness to do business in russia for example

7635455 my work in florida is finished but there is a lot of work to be done in alaska
7635456 t he fact is that contrary to popular belief there was a shockingly high level of sadistic violence and gore in some of the most popular commercial entertainments of the 1950s
7635457 even the most vehement critics of contemporary popular culture would be hard pressed to find anything in todays mainstream mass entertainment as alarming as the gore drenched gun worshipping fantasies that spillane and his publisher dished out for the delectation of millions of ordinary american readers in the supposedly halcyon days of the 1950s
7635458 level of carnage that remains unsurpassed in the history of televised childrens entertainment
7635459 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death
7635460 your enemy is not surrounding your country your enemy is ruling your country

7635463 they said if you dont voluntarily give up the dogs we will arrest you and put you in jail and charge a fine for each dog here
7635464 how can you raise dogs without worming them and vaccinating them trimming their toenails and grooming them
7635465 we petted them and played with them and held them
7635466 they rode around on a golf cart with us they were very well socialized
7635467 imagine you live your entire life inside your house one room inside your house and you never leave it
7635468 once a week somebody dropped groceries at your door thats what life was like for these dogs just one room wire mesh and you pooped where you slept
7635469 all the dogs had food and water in front of them at all times
7635470 a grossly overrun breeding facility wrought with obvious animal neglect
7635471 puedes tener una idea grandiosa y absurda pero el reto es convertirla en una buena historia que sea divertida y aut ntica
7635472 quer amos crear personajes y temperamentos intensos cada uno de los cuales se encuentra en un viaje para encontrar de menos un poco de humanizaci n
7635473 nadie ha explorado esta idea al menos hasta este punto
7635474 quer amos darle a este grandiosa y alocada premisa una impresi n de realidad crear relaciones y emociones veros miles sin sacrificar los grandes ritmos de la comedia
7635475 despu s de haber le do el primer acto supe que quer a hacer esta pel cula
7635476 el gui n evocaba historias de peces fuera del agua con bases rom nticas y no dejaba de sorprenderme
7635477 todd komarnicki ley el gui n en un vuelo nocturno de regreso a nueva york
7635478 y a las dos horas de viaje ya estaba escribiendo mensajes fren ticamente que envi tan pronto y aterriz tenemos que comprar esto tenemos que hacer esta pel cula
7635479 la primera cosa que quer amos hacer era una pel cula divertida despu s quer amos darle un tipo de encanto y emotividad los v nculos entre los personajes le dan a la pel cula su esencia que est envuelta en la comedia
7635480 fue complicado darle vida a una pel cula como meet dave
7635481 hay todo un mundo en el interior de la cabeza de dave eddie donde existen estas personas min sculas despu s tienes a dave ah afuera en el mundo real en seguida y por encima de todo ello tienes a eddie interpretando a una nave en el exterior y al capit n de la nave en el interior
7635482 al principio estaba nervioso pregunt ndome c mo iba a interconectar todos estos elementos
7635483 c mo iba a ser dave porque no es humano y no es un robot es una nave
7635484 el primer d a de rodaje le tom a eddie quiz s 45 minutos en apropiarse de los personajes
7635485 hizo los papeles diferente con respecto a cualquier otra cosa que haya hecho antes
7635486 en meet dave eddie est haciendo la cl sica comedia f sica de la vieja escuela en la misma l nea de buster keaton y charlie chaplin
7635487 tiene la gracia de un bailar n y la concentraci n de un boxeador
7635488 la precisi n t cnica de eddie se demuestra cabalmente cuando le da vida al descontrol de dave conforme el personaje aprende a caminar a aventar una pelota de b isbol o a bailar todas estas cosas ya las damos por sentado pero eddie en el papel de dave hace que se vean nuevas y sorprendentes
7635489 uno de los h roes de esta pel cula es la ciudad de nueva york con todo su caos color y locura
7635490 tiene un aspecto muy parecido al de un cr neo y no tiene ngulos rectos en l
7635491 son curvas compuestas que se unen con otras pens que se ser a un buen lugar para comenzar porque el cuerpo humano no tiene muchos ngulos rectos
7635492 es muy org nico creamos la columna vertebral como si fuera un hueco de elevador para ir a diferentes niveles de la nave te puedes bajar en cualquier piso para aparecer en una cierta parte del t rax
7635493 digo puede actuar ante cualquier cosa incluso un tripi y una pelota de tenis que en el set fungieron como dobles a los que m s tarde se les a adir an los efectos visuales
7635494 chosen to take the low road in its business practices
7635495 in doing so this company has fallen far short of meeting the high business standards that iowans expect
7635496 there will be no industrial jungles in iowa on my watch
7635497 in the end we are certain that the governor will see firsthand that our plant is anything but a jungle and that when all the bitterness of the last few months is taken out of the equation that we are indeed on a course to being on an even higher road
7635498 all iowans not just those who work within his administration have a right to know the level of the governors concerns and the fact that their government is acting responsibly in response to the disturbing reports
7635499 compliance with the law is the sole issue here it is the state of iowas duty to assure that compliance
7635500 only when the law is fully complied with will iowas workers and consumers and iowas environment be adequately protected
7635501 you should know that both the lt governor and i strongly urge your prompt prosecution of all alleged criminal or civil law violations that are supported by sufficient evidence
7635502 wir schwimmen hinten ganz sch n es kann sehr gut sein dass wir bis zum 31 august noch einen spieler verpflichten
7635503 there is a definition of black america but no definition of white america
7635504 id rather be a lamppost in harlem than governor of georgia
7635505 if you have six and the white guy has five you lose
7635506 sean combs recalls his satisfaction when a gigantic poster of
7635507 whats good for blacks has to be bad for whites
7635508 there is no other way for abkhazia and south ossetia we will never go back to the past
7635509 through their insane violence the georgian authorities have hollowed out a bloody and bottomless pit between georgia on the one side and south ossetia and abkhazia on the other
7635510 our two peoples are never under any condition going to live in the same state with georgia
7635511 everyone who sees the popatot at the beach and the kids soccer and tee ball games wants to know where we got it nobody has seen an entertainment center like this
7635512 i made the first one in my garage just for personal use with our children but the response from other parents prompted us to file for a patent and create a new product for families on the go
7635513 for the last year evan and i have been designing and building the prototype creating a company looking for financing and a manufacturer in addition to raising our 5 kids
7635514 popatot was born while camping with the family last year stacy and i found it difficult to keep the baby in a safe place while we setup camp cooked over the fire and watched the other four kids
7635515 so while sitting around the fire late one night we developed the concept on a paper sack almost unbelievably it will be delivered around labor day
7635516 its safe for my children and so simple to use
7635517 no more lugging multiple play sets and toys we just grab the popatot with the toys already in place and off we go its perfect when i go to my moms house
7635518 kelley has demonstrated unwavering dedication to children and families while also modeling starr commonwealths core values of honesty compassion respect responsibility and fairness

7635520 im looking forward to returning to the van wert community
7635521 its where i began my career met my husband and made a lot of friends i have so many fond memories of van wert and our family is looking forward to making more
7635522 i am extremely excited about this chance to work with a new population of students help even more families and the challenges and opportunities ahead
7635523 okay i can see thats darwin there in the middle and that must be the beagle on the left but whats that squiggly sketch hovering next to darwins temple what ship is pictured upper right and what gives with the sheet music
7635524 ronald dean explained that the painting is a representation of the arrival of charles darwin at the galapagos islands in the background is naturally hms beagle whilst in the foreground a small boat makes its way to the islands carrying charles darwin the figure in the bow a biologist who had developed an interest in charles darwin and later hms beagle apparently commissioned the painting the patron had also collected a lot of material and technical plans relating to hms beagle which were temporarily loaned to the artist to ensure a ship portrait which was as technically accurate as possible although the oil painting representation of beagle by the remarkable john chancellor is the image that is familiar in peoples minds i thought might be interesting to see a different less familiar interpretation particularly since it features the famous english naturalist
7635525 i proved to day the utility of a contrivance which will afford me many hours of amusement amp work
7635526 11th i am quite tired having worked all day at the produce of my net the number of animals that the net collects is very great amp fully explains the manner so many animals of a large size live so far from land many of these creatures so low in the scale of nature are most exquisite in their forms amp rich colours it creates a feeling of wonder that so much beauty should be apparently created for such little purpose
7635527 this appears to be only the second recorded use of a plankton net the first being that of j v thompson a few years earlier of which cd may have learnt from professor grant in edinburgh it is evidently based on the oyster trawl recommended to him in a letter from john coldstream dated 13 september 1831 see correspondence 1 151 3 which however was designed with a bar to scrape along the bottom rather than collecting at the surface in open water
7635528 in a heroic encounter its a little more fair for the npcs the point of a heroic encounter is to give players a specific story heavy experience that you couldnt have in the open world
7635529 es necesario proseguir los canjes estas manifestaciones de buena voluntad son actos humanitarios importantes para salvar vidas proteger los derechos humanos de las v ctimas del conflicto y empezar a reconstruir una confianza mutua entre las partes
7635530 todas las violaciones de los derechos humanos y del derecho humanitario
7635531 considero necesario crear una comisi n de investigaci n parlamentaria ad hoc
7635532 bombarderos intensivos y a ciegas de tsjinvali y de destrucci n de zonas residenciales
7635533 esencial que se den a la poblaci n rusa y georgiana informaciones exactas sobre las p rdidas humanas y materiales
7635534 el respeto de los derechos humanos del derecho humanitario y del estado de derecho deben ser garantizados por todos los medios

7635640 on the plains and mountains of the american west the united states army had once learned everything there was to learn about hit and run tactics and guerrilla warfare
7635641 the candidate of change went with the status quo in picking sen joe biden to be his running mate barack obama sought to shore up his weakness inexperience in office and on foreign policy rather than underscore his strength as a new generation candidate defying political conventions he picked a 35 year veteran of the senate the ultimate insider rather than a candidate from outside washington such as govs tim kaine of virginia or kathleen sebelius of kansas or from outside his party such as sen chuck hagel of nebraska or from outside the mostly white male club of vice presidential candidates hillary rodham clinton didnt even make his short list the picks say something profound about obama for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack the biden selection is the next logistical step in an obama campaign that has become more negative a strategic decision that may be necessary but threatens to run counter to his image

7635683 philosophical questions about mean variance analyses and optimizations is it important for an investor in the accumulation phase to control portfolio variance assuming this is a buy and hold investor not prone to behavioral panics obviously portfolio variance is important in the withdrawal phase but i was hoping to get some feedback on the utility of minimizing variance in the accumulation phase
7635684 im guessing that if you used data intervals of more than one month youd have less of a need to make the potentially controversial decision to constrain the optimization to be sure a larger sample size does allow you to predict return and risk within a narrower confidence interval but its all past data anyway so its not like youre going to be 99 confident that the future is going to resemble the past even with the larger sample

7635746 larger design organizations are slow because of excessive red tape at orchid we cut through that red tape and complete designs rapidly

7635748 using cpf our engineers described the power intent as part of the rtl delivery to the back end design house shortening the loops providing consistent guidance and avoiding misunderstanding between the front end and back end engineers
7635749 the proof of the flow is our successful silicon we estimate that we were able to save about 10 weeks of precious design time by using cadences cpf based low power design flow
7635750 this design provides yet another perfect example of the value of the cadence low power solution first time right silicon on time
7635751 the cadence low power solution has been production proven and used successfully in production at more than 50 companies the low power design methodology with the si2 common power format as a basis enables these companies to quickly deliver highly competitive ultra low power products to their markets

7635776 in no particular order this is a sample of what i heard
7635777 communism provides services to the people such as a job a place to live and universal health care
7635778 communism is not what makes china bad it is corporate fascism
7635779 the goal is not to reduce the price of oil but to eliminate it from society
7635780 wouldnt it be great if hillary clinton was nominated for president and we got rid of that little putz
7635781 john mccain is a senile son of a bitch who needs someone to change his depends sanitary pants because he is too stupid to know what it means when his diapers are wet

7635783 i dont know how to do that just drop in an alu and call it a day
7635784 this wont be on the exam or will it muaaahahahah
7635785 by finding out how it works it might help drug discovery researchers and doctors learn how other herbal and conventional drugs work in multiple ways when herbal medicines are effective its often because of a synergy of different biological effects alzheimers disease is caused by multiple factors not just one thing that has gone wrong
7635786 it has the same effect on memory or cognition as many of the anti dementia drugs and that would be measured by commonly used dementia scales so and the research has actually shown that there is quite significant benefit to using ginkgo biloba in those cases
7635787 a respected colleague who has done an outstanding job leading the college enrollment has grown substantially she successfully made the case for major building projects and she led development of innovative programs that have helped more students successfully complete their programs
7635788 i feel good about the contributions ive made to this thriving college i am leaving an institution committed to continuous quality improvement
7635789 i think gold is finding its base here its mostly technical support holding prices above 820 any dips below 820 are seen as a buying opportunity
7635790 i guess the 800 psychological level support will come into play again i believe physical demand for gold is likely to remain good and perhaps the shortage may support the market a bit
7635791 if we start moving below 810 we will probably move to 800 very soon and perhaps gold could retest to the 770s again
7635792 near term support for platinum should come in around the 1 350 level and if we do move below those levels we could see another bout of selling towards 1 250 to 1 300

7635796 over the course of the day we began experiencing similar problems in peripheral databases until our shipping system went down
7635797 we have nearly finished the dismantling and cleaning of the wreckage weve removed all the bodies
7635798 so far there are some 20 people alive in accordance with the preliminary data there were citizens from a few countries from three to four countries including china kazakhstan canada iran kyrgyzstan both the plane and the crew were from kyrgyzstan the plane a boeing 737 was built in 1979
7635799 if russia puts georgia on its knees again the key western ally in this region how can others resist
7635800 dramatic increase of russian influence in the entire post soviet space
7635801 with georgia under russia azerbaijan has no alternative way of energy supply except via russia and it means that azerbaijan is also controlled without a single shot
7635802 so the question is whether we all pay a price today and prevent worse things from happening tomorrow or we continue to appease russias political leadership and pay a high price tomorrow
7635803 i think probably every third person in here is interested
7635804 im in a position that if theres an opening that seems appropriate im going to go do it i think given my financial background that could come in handy some day
7635805 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7635806 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7635807 if the west continues to support georgian president mikheil saakashvili there will be new demonstrations in south ossetia and the preparations for a new round of aggression will oblige us to help and protect the republic
7635808 the recognition of its independence will enable us to send our forces there
7635809 russia is trying to legalize its occupied territory in georgia
7635810 it is absolutely nonsense to recognize a territory without the consent of its population
7635811 we should remember it has not been in russias interests to fully recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia
7635812 if it recognizes the break away territories now russia loses some leverage in the region especially in abkhazia

7635818 this is a great time to be a student at heidelberg
7635819 we paid 3 billion dollars for these stations well tell you what the news is the news is what we say it is

7635821 i think that we will finally be able to make a substantial dent in the 75 percent of people in this country who still believe the conspiracy theorists
7635822 i totally believed there was a conspiracy but after you read the book you are almost embarrassed that you ever believed it
7635823 to think that guys who grew up in the 60s would make a mini series supporting the idea that oswald acted alone is something i certainly wouldnt have predicted but time and evidence can change the way we view things

7635828 i came to america as a young adult after high school at united christian secondary commercial school at apapa blessed with all the tools both from home and from school to succeed if given the opportunity america provided that opportunity for me to fulfill my dream in order to make ends meet upon my arrival i picked several odd jobs dish washer in a chinese restaurant in washington dc a security guard in an office building in downtown washington dc and then a taxi driver while doing all these odd jobs i never lost focus on my ultimate goal so you might say that i moved from a dish washer to being a chancellor of a university which i believe is a testament to having the right kind of values hardwork dedication honesty discipline and just doing the right thing at all times
7635829 i like our guys having that feeling of coming out of the locker room at halftime
7635830 we played awfully good football to the start the second half in all three phases wed like to continue that
7635831 things are moving so fast in race relations a negro could be president in 40 years prejudice exists and probably will continue to but we have tried to make progress and we are making progress we are not going to accept the status quo
7635832 a meeting of history and prophecy or just a manipulation of dates and events
7635833 are you serious ah praise god halleluyah so at last justice has been done this is unbelievable i am so happy for all the guys that made the team i am happy and also sad for members of the american team who are clean but had to lose their medal because of two people who tested positive to drugs
7635834 we are now awaiting the official presentation of the medal to us this will also be announced by ioc
7635835 although the medal has been long in coming we deserve to have it
7635836 i am happy to hear about the re awarding of the medals i am looking forward to the presentation i am also happy that all four members of the squad are alive to witness this that it has become a reality makes some of us happy it will be a turning point in my live and career the ultimate in sports is an olympic gold and for some one to say in his lifetime that he is an olympic medalist is a thing of joy
7635837 i can assure you that if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
7635838 this is a case where everyone was so enamored and felt so much sympathy for the holocaust survivor it just overwhelmed everyone in the case including the jury
7635839 now to find out that the book was not true that is fraud on the court
7635840 this credibility issue is something jane is digging up now
7635841 thats not what the trial was about it was about the fact that she cheated us
7635842 she said the reason she was so attached to dogs is because she had been so attached to wolves
7635843 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7635844 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7635845 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7635846 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case
7635847 we are reviewing the performance of all routes and have yet to make a conclusion
7635848 i havent even heard about it i dont ever pay attention to that stuff
7635849 shes one of my best friends in the whole wide world and honestly when youre sitting in a room for three hours doing satellite interviews

7635856 another 20 or 30 minutes and we could have had a big one
7635857 you cant help to when you spend that much time with someone
7635858 we work together but some of us also get together outside of work to do stuff together

7635883 remember 18 million people voted for me 18 million people give or take voted for barack
7635884 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention as it should be and there is no doubt that what we are doing is tying to bring everybody together
7635885 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7635886 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7635887 we are doing what is traditionally done were following the traditions of a party convention where senator obama and i and our campaigns agreed that we would both be put in nomination which is a sign of respect and recognition for both of our candidacies there will be as there has traditionally been a roll call vote
7635888 i am very pleased in the outcome of the process i am a great admirer of joe biden
7635889 ive worked with joe i know him well i think he will serve senator obama well in his campaign he will bring a level of real intensity to the campaign trail and he will be a great vice president he has a wealth of knowledge and understanding of the world
7635890 i really appreciate the strong support that i have received from a lot of people who worked hard for me but i am intent upon making sure that i have a democratic president to work with in the senate
7635891 i dont know im doing everything i can possibly do
7635892 this was a very good call quite interesting still dont quite get that give it to the universe thing stumps me every time

7635900 de vraag naar onze dienstverlening is de afgelopen jaren sterk gegroeid en zal dat in de komende jaren ook zeker blijven doen wij staan bekend om de hoge mate van betrokkenheid bij onze klanten met een vestiging in amsterdam kruipen we nog dichter aan tegen bestaande en nieuwe opdrachtgevers in die regio bovendien willen wij op die manier ook de arbeidsmarkt in deze regio aanboren
7635901 de afgelopen jaren hebben we keihard maar gelukkig ook met veel plezier gewerkt om van 2organize en inbetween het succes te maken dat het nu is we zien echter nog volop kansen om oxyma group en haar merken in nederland n daarbuiten nog beter op de kaart te zetten het openen van de vestiging in amsterdam is daarbij slechts een eerste stap
7635902 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees so you cant do it differently
7635903 im looking forward to it thats what you play baseball for is that type of atmosphere those type of games
7635904 i guess i felt more of that during the all star game because it was an all star game and you had time to maybe think about things
7635905 when were playing the team were just trying to beat them thats really what i care about i dont get too caught up in the other stuff
7635906 outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7635907 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits

7635916 todays political debates too often trade substance for sound bites quality discourse for quips and a grown up discussion for carefully rehearsed gotchas
7635917 even the town hall settings of today are filled with supporters from both camps laying in wait to be called upon with a setup question
7635918 if nothing else lincoln douglas style debates would engage the public be informative and perhaps even entertaining
7635919 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator
7635920 a lot of people think the major textbook publishers are against e books
7635921 in our mind this is great because the functionality offered in digital devices is probably more useful in the long run to students than printed books
7635922 we have a strong relationship with amazon were aggregators we offer our materials in any way that our customers would prefer to use them
7635923 the consumer book market is very different from the textbook market
7635924 with textbooks students only buy what they are assigned its a narrow set of titles and you have to have exactly what theyre looking for the bar is higher for any entry in textbook market you need a lot of content
7635925 its very hard to do color the way its used in 90 percent of the textbooks in a biology textbook the minute you lose color you lose real education value ive seen some color prototypes theyre not that bad but the cost hurdles from what i understand are dramatic
7635926 once they get these 20 21 year old kids reading on a kindle i assume theyll have them for life

7635931 this is a serious issue rightly rated critical by red hat and while there may not be cases of widespread exploitation of it it does require prompt and direct response i think red hat is doing that and in the end i think this issue will be highlighted by the companys response
7635932 that would be very bad indeed although red hat says that no updates appear to have been compromised
7635933 the debian openssl issue was another significant security matter both illustrate some of the security concerns internal breaches or code corruption that may be more specific to open source
7635934 most enterprise users of linux and open source software are coming to trust it and increase their use in general i dont think this will impact that trend
7635935 red hat customers have cause to be aware and to be concerned but with any enterprise grade operating system there are going to be security issues this is why i believe it is the vendors response that is most critical customers are being kept aware and updated with patches so i would say the issue is being handled adequately
7635936 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator

7635956 now why the hell did he the put camera over there
7635957 the findings will enhance our evidence base and generate important information for hospital clinical and support staff as well as for public health in general
7635958 malnutrition is preventable and if treated early can improve outcomes for patients and residents in the long run treatment saves the nhs and social care system money as the cost of treatment is small compared with the potential benefits to be gained
7635959 this will provide evidence for hospitals and care homes on the scale of the problem they have to tackle
7635960 he still has reaction where once he goes for a little bit he has to watch it because it gets sore on him
7635961 hes never had a good offseason hes never had the strength hes never had the complete commitment to the offseason like hes had
7635962 after having a president for eight years who cant go beyond talking points its a good thing that biden can dig into the issues even if he occasionally goes overboard

7635967 to all of our family and friends we are pleased to announce that our little princess anja louise ambrosio mazur was born on sunday aug 24 at 7 32 p m
7635968 i can see that but what are you looking for
7635969 a lot of people think that its better to be safe than sorry and the only way they can be safe is maybe if i carry something you know
7635970 i think there is this feeling that these troubles are happening far removed from the center
7635971 you just asked whether im worried i cant say that i really am no
7635972 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
7635973 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
7635974 what annoys you pdq asks readers to share what gets under their skin
7635975 in the course of your job whats the one thing people do that annoys you the most
7635976 not so subtle hope is that the people doing these terrible things will read these answers and well um stop already
7635977 its a real honor to be part of the final sessions program
7635978 early in the planning process the convention organizers asked me to be part of the run up to senator mccains acceptance speech they asked us to keep that secret until the final convention program was determined i look forward to representing oklahoma at the podium on this historic night
7635979 the theme for the final night is peace and the need to defend america
7635980 they have asked me to address issues related to terrorism with some discussion of how oklahoma responded so well to the bombing in 1995 its an opportunity to tell our story to the nation and to remind viewers that the oklahoma standard we displayed 13 years ago is really an american standard of helping others and standing together in difficult times
7635981 the hypocrites outward appearance shines brightly and passes for holiness but under that show lies the terrible weight of his deceit which the soul must bear through all eternity
7635982 a cock to service 10 hens will go crazy at this rate
7635983 take any picture you can one out of four will be good one out of ten will be very good and one out of 15 will get you an academy award
7635984 its not how good you are its how long you last
7635985 one way or another when we select the palme dor winner i think we are going to feel very confident that the filmmaker who made the film is very aware of the times in which he or she lives
7635986 i hope i never become so devoid of talent that i take a liking to politics
7635987 j g be fair you havent even seen the film and you already have your knife out
7635988 it was very frustrating to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people who told me how much they regret passing on traffic passed on this one too
7635989 im not good at future planning i dont plan at all i dont know what im doing tomorrow i dont have a day planner and i dont have a diary i live completely in the now not in the past not in the future
7635990 im not opposed to all wars im opposed to dumb wars
7635991 the president always has the right to act preemptively if we are in imminent danger if they are coming up over the hill he can respond if troops are coming out of tijuana heading north we can respond if they are coming down from toronto we can respond if missiles are on their way we can respond but that is not the way i hear it being used here we are talking about preemption as if we are adopting a policy
7635992 the president has argued that confronting iraq would not detract from the unfinished war against terrorism i believe he is right we should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time
7635993 i think its not only time not to take force off the table i think its time to put force on the table and use it
7635994 how have campaign contributions and lobbying efforts influenced policy on an issue you care about
7635995 high oil prices and a high oil proportion coming from outside countries was the motivation to find ethanol
7635996 we can harness the ingenuity of farmers and scientists citizens and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil and save our planet from a point of no return
7635997 people understand you dont get through the iowa caucus without supporting ethanol
7635998 its all about who can give the candidates the most money to get into office
7635999 i had my glass of ethanol this morning and im feeling good
7636000 if i were campaigning in nebraska like clinton or obama i would love ethanol
7636001 they can be excellent on the stump and speak intelligently without communicating anything they dont want to
7636002 so to avoid a corn ethanol confrontation they go right back to national security
7636003 it would be about an ethanol plant going up in a rural community and a guy in town starts cooking up something in his cellar that would make corn based ethanol obsolete then the ethanol big corn guys come and bump him off
7636004 stories wouldnt be very good if they didnt have bad parts
7636005 well there was this fairy and she lived in the woods and she flitted here and there and all was wonderful

7636023 the influence and impact of new media in recent years is undeniable but many folks miss out on the conversation aspect of social media were making it easy to follow the conversation and in fact join it by putting the entire chorus of democratic national convention bloggers and qikkers in one place
7636024 if my steps went aside from the way and my heart followed my eyes

7636036 we have a recovery wellness room in the convention center that is available to people who are in recovery from substance abuse and mental health issues
7636037 we have 12 step meetings inside the room as well as some mental health support meetings were just a safe harbor room for people who are hear at the convention who might need a safe place to go
7636038 a vote for obama is a vote for dead babies

7636040 there is hardly anything that can make one happier than to feel that one counts for something with other people
7636041 god does not give us everything we want but he does fulfill all his promises i e he remains the lord of the earth he preserves his church constantly renewing our faith and not laying on us more than we can bear gladdening us with his nearness and help hearing our prayers and leading us along the best and straightest paths to himself by his faithfulness in doing this god creates in us praise for himself
7636042 there would be truth in the surrealist affirmation that this world is hell if there is no god but it is a lie for there is a god it is a lie because there is beauty and truth for whoever wants to see it it is a lie because man knows that love and righteousness are possible and thank god belong to the true real reality
7636043 the imagination was originally created to be gods territory a faculty of mans soul that would help him to comprehend the invisible realities
7636044 there can be no doubt that lewis was a christian evangelist of outstanding genius a reading of his many essays and his fiction reveals a converted soul a heart struggling to communicate the mysteries of god a mind awake
7636045 history is not just the concern of historians and social scientists it is not the lonely domain of political prognosticators and ivory tower academics it is the very stuff of life and it is the very stuff of faith in fact the bible puts a heavy emphasis on historical awareness not at all surprising considering the fact that the vast proportion of its own contents record the dealings of god with men and nations throughout the ages

7636053 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7636054 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7636055 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7636056 there have been some from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament

7636058 its being done all over the u s if youre not doing anything wrong you shouldnt have a problem with it
7636059 central park is so important to downtown with concerts the christmas village
7636060 if youre not doing anything wrong you shouldnt have a problem with it this gives me another tool to monitor central park it doesnt cost me anything and im all for it
7636061 for instance this camera can zoom way in what if youre reading a newspaper or reading a book people in a park they date they hold hands they kiss what if theyre holding a political meeting
7636062 and we want people to be relaxed in a park setting
7636063 while it is legal i think its very very inappropriate
7636064 we arent here to spy on people nor do we intend to
7636065 were not trying to be the eye in the sky on a covert mission
7636066 if i could put it in a nutshell its just another means of building security say if we had a building lockdown at central park complex in a 9 11 type situation
7636067 its being done all over the u s and in pittsburgh and its appropriate
7636068 it gives us an opportunity to cover a lot of ground in terms of public safety
7636069 it is amazing in the united states these cameras are just sprouting up without any regulation
7636070 it is not in violence and crime that our greatest danger lies
7636071 as for money the relationship between it and effective schools has been studied to death the unanimous conclusion is that there is no connection between school funding and school performance
7636072 my i cant believe how well this government agency operates

7636077 with the state in lockdown and the disease spreading rapidly
7636078 this was the largest exotic disease response ever witnessed in australia
7636079 during the outbreak we learnt how highly contagious equine influenza is how humans can inadvertently spread it and the importance of working with industry and all horse owners to get rid of the disease
7636080 our racing breeding and many other horse sectors like equestrian rodeo and polocrosse are back in business and are looking forward to a bright future and a spring that is memorable for the right reasons
7636081 the nsw governments successful eradication programme means that these industries do not need to live with ei
7636082 virologists and laboratory staff at nsw dpis elizabeth macarthur agricultural institute conducted more than 132 000 sample tests 3000 a day in the busiest period
7636083 while these are very very impressive figures the successful eradication could not have happened without the support and sacrifice of the 50 000 people who are part of our horse industries
7636084 horses and horse events will return to country shows where they were cancelled last year

7636091 it just started raining and it didnt want to stop
7636092 weve lost 50 percent of the crop we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7636093 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7636094 it will not end the drought it will make a dent
7636095 we will be a different medical school when we are done
7636096 the intent is to get people from different research perspectives mixing together and hopefully to get ideas that wouldnt emerge otherwise
7636097 in the past weve only seen each other in the hallway or on an elevator once in a while
7636098 the old days of working in a dark lab with fruit flies without a clinical endpoint are gone
7636099 at a lot of other cancer centers the researchers in the labs are well separated from the clinics
7636100 here the idea is to bring basic research right next to the hospital

7636108 they may have been changes that we would have made but not necessarily as quickly as we are doing now

7636120 i am aware that there is a high level of public interest in hendra which is why i have asked for an independent review of the departments emergency response
7636121 queenslanders can be assured that this review will be properly focused and they can expect that those responsible will identify how and where improvements can be made
7636122 the draft terms of reference include a review of the departments standard operating procedures as well as standards for veterinarians about the handling of suspect hendra virus cases
7636123 biosecurity queenslands officers continue to learn and examine their operating standards
7636124 the processes required to appoint an independent consultant to head the review are under way and its expected the services of an appropriately qualified person will be secured next week

7636132 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
7636133 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future

7636135 as to whether well continue with traditional transistors or whether well move to a surface device such as tri gate transistors that weve been talking about now for at least the last four or five years
7636136 its sometime in that next decade after the transition to surface cmos technology around the time when were making 10nm devices that we want to start looking at other quantum properties
7636137 historically weve not been able to look more than a decade out and it takes around a decade to perfect the use of these new materials for example our work in high k started about a decade ago and thats a good measure for how long these technology advancements take
7636138 which is obviously going to hold things up a little bit especially as firefox 2 0 0 16 is currently available in forty five languages as a fully localised build and a further five as downloadable language packs

7636146 you would vaccinate twice annually your performance horses and it wouldnt be compulsory for all other horse breeders it would be optional
7636147 most of the world does vaccinate there is a massive risk of not vaccinating
7636148 there is to be a national summit in sydney on september 25 to discuss future options for equine influenza management in australia
7636149 the ministers comments if accurate seem premature given that the summit has not yet taken place
7636150 ahic surveys and other feedback clearly indicate that the majority of participants in the australian horse industry including the racing sector do not favour ongoing vaccination against equine influenza
7636151 only an effective quarantine programme will prevent another outbreak ongoing vaccinations wont help
7636152 ongoing vaccination wont prevent another outbreak the horses who brought the disease with them last year were all vaccinated vaccinated horses can still get equine influenza and spread it to unvaccinated horses
7636153 also if theres another outbreak theres no guarantee that the vaccination being used will work if theres a new strain of the virus flu viruses mutate regularly and imported horses could easily bring in a new strain we would be vaccinating with yesterdays vaccine against tomorrows virus
7636154 effective quarantine is the only way of preventing another costly outbreak

7636162 weather is what we know so naturally it was our preferred weapon
7636163 if the city wants to close a mile and a half stretch of road to cars its only fair that we close it to pedestrians and bicycles too
7636164 have fun and see what the city could be like if we drive less
7636165 people drive their cars through here as if the roads were built for them or something
7636166 im all in favor of driving less but i dont understand why the city broke into my garage and towed my prius

7636358 now to find out that the book was not true that is fraud on the court
7636359 this credibility issue is something jane is digging up now
7636360 thats not what the trial was about it was about the fact that she cheated us
7636361 she said the reason she was so attached to dogs is because she had been so attached to wolves
7636362 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7636363 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7636364 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7636365 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case

7636367 were getting back to a more average type of production after a couple of years of fairly hot dry conditions in parts of the prairies
7636368 rains have certainly hurt the harvest on the wheat crop in terms of quality rendered probably some of it unsuitable for milling

7636370 our expectation is that prices will stay up for those commodities a little bit more than for the wheats that have been downgraded to the feed level
7636371 we introduced ourselves as a muslim and buddhist and a bahai who were all part of this interfaith council and like him were all working to try to build mutual understanding between faiths and try to reduce conflict in the world
7636372 he wanted to hear more about it so he suggested that we come to jordan to learn what they were doing in terms of conferences and dialogues and the way in which they were trying to build a society that was accepting of various types of beliefs
7636373 for people who are interested in politics conflict and religion there is no substitute for making a trip to the middle east to talk to people who are living it
7636374 the conference in vienna allowed the students to reflect on how what they studied at princeton could be applied in the practice of international relations they were able to interact with diplomats from around the world to see how these ideas played out in a professional way and to present their ideas to this international body of experts
7636375 the trip to jordan also provided interplay between what princeton students learn in the classrooms and the real concerns and factors present throughout the world
7636376 we had a lot of time for discussion and people were very moved by these experiences the idea was to broaden their perspectives to expand beyond their own context and include the context of other people
7636377 the most important thing i learned from these trips is that people no matter where you go are complex all societies are complex and as a result every way of life is infinitely nuanced it serves me well to remember that in thinking about how to make this world a better place i will only be able to do so if i have deepest respect for those i interact with
7636378 one of the really special parts of the vienna conference was the candid intergenerational discussion
7636379 you had people who have been working in the field all over the world on the front lines and students who are entering that realm and have studied the intersection of religion and politics there was a real openness of discussion and frankness of dialogue and the sharing of information the younger generation never felt as though we were only speaking once in a while we were really heard and listened to and it was an open debate where peoples points were valued
7636380 it definitely caught a lot of media play which i didnt expect at all
7636381 all of the participants left not just with a connection to each other but a sense of connection to jordan that we didnt have before
7636382 there was such a depth of interaction and honest discussion with the jordanian students and those we traveled with through the country that a real sense of commitment was created
7636383 not from the formal sessions we had to discuss interfaith dialogue but from the experience of actually being in the country and witnessing how this worked everything from eating the local food with our hands together to seeing the great construction of petra and i learned so much from sharing life stories with jordanian students and from the conversations in the breaks or over dinner where no one was taking notes
7636384 these trips have given new life to many ideas we talk about in school both at lunch and in the classroom this has both deepened my appreciation for what i have learned and given me new ideas for how i want to live my life and interact with others
7636385 i want to make clear that this half millenium coverage ends in the 1990s none of my commentary on america and the world has been shaped by 21st century events
7636386 there really is no time for any frivolity people are already working two jobs to put gas in the tank so they can drive from the first job to the second job people need to spend as much of their free time as possible for candidates
7636387 i would rather you go and work for a local candidate than read my book
7636388 on the issues and on the importance of the election
7636389 but i dont agree about reading his book if people are going to vote wisely they need to understand whats at stake
7636390 i expect youll see a lot of editorial excitement from us on that book
7636391 in this world of celebrity blogs and entertainment gossip television we are intensely aware of public figures who perform the same function as mythological figures did in an earlier period
7636392 when i first started to read it i thought oh it was going to be a hatchet job but i enjoyed it anyway i was amazed with what she could do with so few pages at the beginning
7636393 we just felt the media coverage would benefit from a clearer field postelection and that is looking increasingly true
7636394 i did not ask wealth for my own it was just to make my rival groan
7636395 giants the parallel lives of abraham lincoln and frederick douglass
7636396 his functions as commander in chief have been undertreated compared to many other aspects of his life and career
7636397 i had trouble with english class in high school thank god there was world war ii or i might still be there that should give you an idea of my reading background
7636398 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
7636399 estou realmente feliz por estar aqui neste momento especial para mim quero tamb m despedir me dos torcedores do chelsea que sempre me apoiaram nos ltimos dois anos

7636585 in england the women are elegant until they are ten years old and perfect on grand occasions in france a few women are entirely elegant always in american most women are smart and impeccable but with too much of an accent on immaturity for real elegance the latin american woman dressed in paris is the very height of perfection however
7636586 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7636587 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7636588 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7636589 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7636590 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7636591 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7636592 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

7636595 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7636596 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

7636599 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7636600 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7636601 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7636602 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7636603 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7636604 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7636605 but he is in the situation where he cant hit back which jackie robinson could not do
7636606 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7636607 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7636608 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7636609 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7636610 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7636611 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7636612 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7636613 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7636614 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7636615 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7636616 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7636617 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7636618 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7636619 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7636620 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7636621 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7636622 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7636623 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7636624 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7636625 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7636626 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7636627 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7636628 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7636629 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7636630 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7636631 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7636632 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7636633 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7636634 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7636635 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7636636 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7636637 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7636638 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7636639 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7636640 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7636641 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7636642 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7636643 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7636644 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7636645 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7636646 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7636647 no one works for someone we all just work together
7636648 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7636649 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7636650 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7636651 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7636652 last night i discovered a new new york favorite in park blue

7636654 as appealing as the prospect of cloud computing may be many cios analysts and even vendors themselves see it emerging only gradually in the enterprise
7636655 over time as larger and larger businesses decide to use google apps there will be an upswing in the revenue
7636656 the first counterintuitive lesson companies that build large networks on the web dont charge users what the market would bear they charge as little as they could bear that is how they maximize growth and value for everyone in the network on top of the platforms they provide
7636657 livin off coke and brew so much time to sit and lose
7636658 i had enough of my time and so i threw it away

7636665 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7636666 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7636667 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7636668 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7636669 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7636670 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7636671 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7636672 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7636673 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7636674 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7636675 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is

7636677 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7636678 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7636679 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7636680 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7636681 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7636682 i cant think of anyone i know whos less like morgan freeman than you

7636692 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
7636693 the beijing olympics have been a spectacular sporting event but they took place against a backdrop of human rights violations with activists prevented from expressing their views peacefully and many in detention when they have committed no crime
7636694 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate human rights improvements but in most respects they failed to deliver forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics
7636695 it is high time for the ioc to put its core values of human dignity and universal fundamental ethical principles into practice by making human rights a new pillar of the olympic games
7636696 gathering a crowd to disturb order in a public place
7636697 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 per cent perhaps a boy awaits us
7636698 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character

7636714 shareholders or beneficiaries of a reit who sell or exchange their interests in the reit at a loss within six months after it was purchased must generally treat the loss as a long term capital loss rather than a short term capital loss to the extent of any capital gains allocated to their interest whether distributed or not
7636715 the operation continues to be a disaster and is getting worse by the day

7636756 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7636757 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7636758 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

7636767 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7636768 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7636769 there is a need to see climate change as an issue of global social justice the rights interests and needs of those affected by climate change must be acknowledged
7636770 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7636771 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7636772 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7636773 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7636774 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7636775 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7636776 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7636777 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7636778 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7636779 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7636780 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7636781 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7636782 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7636783 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7636784 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

7636786 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7636787 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7636788 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7636789 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7636790 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7636791 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7636792 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7636793 then what do you do next year you start with an even bigger hole
7636794 sometimes its a matter of getting things in your mind and you start trying too hard to accomplish something its easier said than done to just let it happen and trust it it does wear on your mind some
7636795 were playing so good who really cares about your stats

7636801 in the 1940s everybody had different men in their lives you had the seltzer man you had the milk man these were the people in your life its a different world today
7636802 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7636803 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7636804 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7636805 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7636806 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7636807 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7636808 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7636809 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7636810 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7636811 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

7636813 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7636814 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7636815 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7636816 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7636817 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7636818 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7636819 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7636820 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7636821 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7636822 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7636823 america after bush what the next president must do to build an economy that works for all
7636824 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7636825 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

7636883 es una meta para que la campa a consiga ese voto al m ximo pero el equipo de barack obama est en el proceso y yo creo que est n haciendo un esfuerzo admirable
7636884 el problema m s serio que va a tener barack obama es que no tiene un expediente con los hispanos
7636885 nunca ha estado presente ni mucho menos activo con temas que realmente importan a la comunidad como por ejemplo la inmigraci n

7636932 this was considered a high honor and the duke was most likely the man of the highest rank in attendance this is why he was so offended when the cardinal dipped his hands effectively inferring that the duke was inferior to the cardinal who was the son of a butcher this was a factual incident i hope this has helped you to understand melanie

7636970 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7636971 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7636972 these areas are host to some of the worlds most biodiverse coral reefs and habitat and some of the most interesting and compelling geological formations in all of our oceans
7636973 crowdsourcing what it means and how people are currently taking advantage of the opportunities it brings
7636974 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7636975 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7636976 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7636977 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7636978 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7636979 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7636980 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7636981 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7636982 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7636983 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7636984 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7636985 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7636986 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7636987 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7636988 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7636989 fringe takes the world that we all live in and says what you think you know about this cup you dont actually know because if you look at it from over here its something entirely different that will be the thrust of the show the physical world that we live in without the addition of any magic or anything supernatural is far more than we all see it as being

7636993 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 percent perhaps a boy awaits us
7636994 it makes it harder for average people to file for bankruptcy protection it makes it easier for landlords to evict a bankrupt tenant it endangers child support payments by giving a wider array of creditors a shot at post bankruptcy income it allows millionaires to shield an unlimited amount of equity in homes and asset protection trusts it makes it more difficult for small businesses to reorganize while opening new loopholes for the enrons of the world it allows creditors to provide misleading information and it does nothing to rein in lending abuses
7636995 i do not believe this is a rush to war
7636996 the terms of surrender dictated by the united nations require him to declare and destroy his weapons of mass destruction programs he has not done so
7636997 many predicted the administration would refuse to give the weapons inspectors one last chance to disarm
7636998 mr president president bush did not lash out precipitously after 9 11 he did not snub the u n or our allies he did not dismiss a new inspection regime he did not ignore the congress at each pivotal moment he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation
7636999 for two decades saddam hussein has relentlessly pursued weapons of mass destruction there is a broad agreement that he retains chemical and biological weapons the means to manufacture those weapons and modified scud missiles and that he is actively seeking a nuclear capability
7637000 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after biden confided to his colleagues that this would be a long fight but was still for it i am absolutely confident the president will not take us to war alone i am absolutely confident we will enhance his ability to get the world to be with us by us voting for this resolution
7637001 some democrats have been pleading with obama to use mccains tough response to the russian invasion of georgia to paint him as a trigger happy interventionist who would risk bringing a war weary nation into military conflict in regions where the united states has no interest
7637002 for those democrats bidens conclusions from his trip may be a disappointment
7637003 consultations with georgian president mikheil saakashvili georgian prime minister lado gurgenidze georgian parliamentary speaker david bakradze and u s ambassador to georgia john tefft left the democratic senator seemingly as angry as mccain is
7637004 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism

7637070 thats not what the trial was about it was about the fact that she cheated us
7637071 she said the reason she was so attached to dogs is because she had been so attached to wolves
7637072 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7637073 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7637074 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7637075 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case
7637076 our overall advice to candidates has been to stay home
7637077 not to separate themselves from the democratic party but because thats where their constituents are you dont find your constituents in denver and these are important days

7637091 the transformation from rural to urban life was so sudden and so wrenching that the only thing society could do to manage was to drink itself into a stupor for a generation and it wasnt until society woke up from that collective bender that we actually started to get the institutional structures that we associate with the industrial revolution today things like public libraries and museums increasingly broad education for children elected leaders a lot of things we happen until having all of those people together stopped seeming like a crisis and started seeming like an asset it wasnt until people started thinking of this as a vast civic surplus one they could design for rather than just dissipate that we started to get what we think of now as an industrial society
7637092 so how big is that surplus so if you take wikipedia as a kind of unit all of wikipedia the whole project every page every edit every talk page every line of code in every language that wikipedia exists in that represents something like the cumulation of 100 million hours of human thought
7637093 its precisely when no one has any idea how to deploy something that people have to start experimenting with it in order for the surplus to get integrated and the course of that integration can transform society
7637094 media is actually a triathlon it s three different events people like to consume but they also like to produce and they like to share

7637105 the harper government cut loose a contentious private members bill that would have made it a crime to take the life of a fetus just as election speculation hits fever pitch
7637106 weve heard criticism from across the country including representatives of the medical community that mr epps bill as presently drafted could be interpreted as instilling fetal rights let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7637107 for this reason im announcing that the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but do so in a way that leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights

7637115 um outro truque que voc pode utilizar pedir alguma informa o que s seu filho realmente sabe como por exemplo a data de anivers rio dele
7637116 we are badasses we would kill or die for our families and that to me is what qualifies for being a badass
7637117 i never thought id be singing in a band im not a singer
7637118 but i can express myself and make you feel something and thats the fred durst in my movies
7637119 that took me to the other side the guy with the beard the director who would sacrifice everything to make the movie
7637120 i knew that i wasnt having lunch with limp bizkit fred durst
7637121 but i was a first time director and it was too big of a budget
7637122 when everyone else around me was telling me to milk the music thing fincher gave me an ultimatum
7637123 its not a coincidence that cube vision works with a lot of first time directors instead of with guys set in their ways who dont want to compromise
7637124 we still want to make the kind of movies we want to make
7637125 i trusted that we wanted to make the same movie
7637126 not a disney comedy about the blunders of football but a dramatic movie about two people who get their pride back

7637143 let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7637144 this is an example of us clarifying what the governments intent is with regards to its agenda and what the governments agenda is not

7637150 the chances that it a new u n scheme to slow deforestation will go ahead in my mind are much higher
7637151 what i saw and heard in our debates on sectoral actions and approaches was a very fruitful debate
7637152 was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
7637153 there is some worry that i might be a lightning rod
7637154 some of it is because i challenged the system at guant namo
7637155 i can see why muslims wanted to go underground after 9 11
7637156 but i have found that if you speak up in politics you can have a positive influence

7637161 has purported to reveal detailed information concerning the substance of the parties meeting last week
7637162 while the breach itself is troubling the committee has exacerbated the problem by providing an inaccurate incomplete and misleading description of the discussions
7637163 if theres one lesson that weve learned from 9 11 we have to have it we have to go forward
7637164 it was either go all the way or not at all with our system
7637165 people need to be able to talk to each other in a crisis were building a system that will provide our people that

7637171 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind thousands of prisoners we cannot rest until they too are freed
7637172 of course i am very glad that he is coming home and i now want him to get a job get married and settle down but the israelis were in ramallah again last night they broke down doors and took away some people so even when people are coming out of jails others are taking their place
7637173 of course i grieve as father to lose such a son it would be more bearable if there was some chance of peace but i do not think that is going to happen
7637174 when mohammed was arrested i was 22 years old my children were babies today i feel i am reborn our familys life is just beginning
7637175 he has been there now for three years and i have only been allowed to see him twice
7637176 men he shares the cell with are being let out but not him i am sad but we are used out men being taken away my husband was imprisoned three times under administrative orders six months each time
7637177 i blame the arabs for what is happening they should either make peace with israel under just terms or fight them they are too disunited to do either
7637178 there is no doubt that we seek peace and we are trying to seek our goals and there wont be peace without the release of all prisoners
7637179 we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7637180 they are so happy and excited they are in love and this news makes things even better
7637181 ligaram para a delegacia falando que o dono da granada tinha sido morto fomos ao local e encontramos um corpo com marcas de tiros na cabe a e no peito e com ferimentos em uma das pernas provavelmente feitas pelos estilha os da granada

7637205 in its first official event a prayer meeting held at the wells fargo theater at denvers colorado convention center of the 2008 democratic convention pentecostal preacher and bishop charles e blake of the church of god in christ took to the pulpit of an interfaith gathering and unequivocally denounced abortion saying god could not be pleased with millions of lives being ended by elective abortion
7637206 this is an amazing development bishop blake was crystal clear in condemning abortion there was nothing subtle about it he identified himself as a pro life democrat and blatantly challenged his partys historic position on abortion he also challenged barack obama to pursue his promise to reduce abortions and to ensure viable alternatives just this one moment is a significant turn for the democratic party

7637210 it is a little bit disconcerting to see what feminism has evolved into
7637211 when theres a group of people attempting to shame female creativity female beauty female pride under the auspices of protecting women its really really scary
7637212 the reality is that these ads and the so called creativity that birthed them casts women in an undignified manner resulting in the opposite of what feminism purports to accomplish
7637213 it was difficult for me to admit that i was dealing with a human being when i was talking to a woman because if you read mens magazines you hear about your stereo your car your chick

7637282 my guess is that banks will have a significant recovery once we get through this period and the markets reestablish themselves

7637363 theres going to be a lot for me to take on board but from what i remember of the rally new zealand i liked it very much

7637436 the moral of the story is kill the parents kill the children
7637437 the cops like that when people know their rights that way they dont have to read them to you on the way to the station
7637438 computers like cats can operate crossdimensionally the trick is in getting them to do what you want
7637439 greece does not have folk music and it does not have folklore
7637440 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music
7637441 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
7637442 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
7637443 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7637457 this is incredibly dramatic for a global perception of china and also for chinas self perception that it can handle something on this scale
7637458 its a kind of financial coming of age itll be an important marker probably in a positive direction as far as we can tell at the moment
7637459 that aggrieved nationalism was the dominant narrative for half a century so the chinese communist party staked its own legitimacy on overcoming all this humiliation
7637460 now china has stood up in the world its clear for everybody to see this offers china a chance to bury this aggrieved baggage theyve carried with them and stand more confidently in the world
7637461 this is not only for sportsmen and women to prove something its for the nation to prove something
7637462 this is a prosperous nation people are doing well and thats more important than simply winning medals from the games
7637463 i spoke to one western guy he said before for him his image of china was 1989 the crackdown now its the birds nest
7637464 i think the government could have taken this as a good opportunity to address the real issues to crack down on corruption to improve the rule of law to open up the media to provide more channels for people to express their grievances
7637465 but instead to absolutely guarantee the smooth operations the government tries to hide the problem and takes excessive measures
7637466 government has to do something to improve chinese soccer skills
7637467 to do that they have to take care of widespread corruption hold officials responsible for failure follow the rule of law in that category i think sports could trigger revolution not radical revolution but piece by piece
7637468 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes

7637488 a small portion of carbohydrates should always be eaten with a protein such as a pitta bread filled with hummus or egg salad
7637489 snacks can be lots of different things from carrots to pots of hummus to sliced fresh fruits with low fat flavoured yogurt its about being creative and trying out different things to find out what your child likes
7637490 try a homemade mix of dried fruits like apricots and raisins with nuts like almonds and walnuts they are packed with nutrients that keep childrens energy levels up just beware of allergies
7637491 the hardest part was we played them off the park and had plenty of chances but just couldnt put them away
7637492 i thought when lloyd green scored wed go on and win it but we just couldnt get that second goal its bitterly disappointing
7637493 weve made the finals two years in a row now but when it comes to the crunch we just werent good enough
7637494 everyones pulling in the same direction were looking good as long as we dont lose sight of where weve come from

7637520 the olympic games attracts many thousands of people to the host country both during and after the event currency retailers offering easy access to yuan and currencies from neighbouring countries will certainly have benefitted from increased sales from the olympic games looking beyond the games foreign currency retailers can expect yuan to remain in demand as china continues to reap the tourism benefits for years to come

7637527 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7637528 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7637529 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7637530 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in europe and fighting the japanese in the pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the
7637531 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7637532 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7637533 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience
7637534 we had been in the air for almost an hour when we heard a loud pop
7637535 the flight attendant came back and told us to remain calm
7637536 thats when we saw the two pilots with the oxygen masks on hearing them breathe like darth vader made it a little harder to stay calm
7637537 so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks i cant imagine what might have happened if that window had shattered at 30 000 feet

7637552 we are proud to be the official sandwich of the georgia bulldogs
7637553 if that issue gets figured out more likely than not overseas and military voters will be the place it gets figured out first
7637554 it certainly isn t going to happen for this fall s election
7637555 it s kind of the next logical step in trying to enfranchise the people who are in the military and overseas
7637556 there s clearly the highest need for those people to cast ballots
7637557 i don t see why a process for voting over the internet would be so problematic
7637558 it hasn t been a problem for military people in australia
7637559 as long as you depend on the software you depend on the few people who know it
7637560 and standing outside the box you cannot see what s happening that box can pretend to be innocuous while it s actually doing evil things
7637561 one of the reasons that spurred me to do this is the millions and millions the dod has spent with the federal voting assistance program
7637562 it hasn t accomplished a dang thing we can do it for a whole lot less money with a whole lot better results
7637563 everything we do is predicated on state law and the state s ability to allow for such transmission
7637564 just like turbotax helps taxpayers navigate the tax code the ovf tool does the same thing
7637565 essentially the fvap has taken the funding given it to a dod contractor to produce a system that already exists which amounts to redundant development and unnecessary waste
7637566 does on a short string budget what the dod and voting office seem incapable of doing with millions of dollars
7637567 there is no trendsetter right now with regard to military voting
7637568 it matters not to me who brings it as long as they expedite
7637569 on the one hand he says god damn america and he says america is responsible for all the ills in the black community on the other hand hes taking money from the same community hes crucifying
7637570 wright believes things like the government funded programs are a necessary compensation for the legacy of white racism part of whats necessary to heal the wounds inflicted over four centuries on blacks his niche is even more specialized he does this sort of work in the context of white denominational mainline protestantism which on the whole has welcomed both him and his message
7637571 they dont have a father to push them discipline them and they give up trying to succeed they dont see themselves as wanted
7637572 if you are concerned about reducing child poverty then you have to focus on missing fathers
7637573 special they are not like me they dont have the background that i have
7637574 but just having him around meant i was picking up his discipline his pride his work ethic
7637575 until i heard it from my son i never understood it
7637576 this is a great day for law abiding citizens of the nations capital who have unjustly been denied their full right to protect themselves and families for over 30 years
7637577 the second amendment guarantees the individual right of citizens to arm themselves for self defense and not become easy prey perhaps the government should find a better way to keep illegal guns away from criminals and not law abiding citizens
7637578 whether provisions in the district of columbia code violate the second amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any state regulated militia but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes
7637579 the authority of the federal government to interfere with the arming
7637580 the second amendment is expressly about the security of the state its about well regulated militias not unregulated individual license
7637581 the framers knew exactly how to condition a right on militia service and they didnt do it with respect to the second amendment
7637582 there are countless instances in which individuals are on their own when it comes to protecting themselves and their property a majority of the justices recognized this and upheld the second amendments specific protection of an individual right to self defense now that d c s citizens have had this constitutional right restored criminals will have good reason to think twice before trying to plunder anothers property
7637583 pledged to make 700 million in contracts and business opportunities available to minority firms each year for a period of ten years
7637584 the merger will eliminate diversity of content and meaningful opportunities for minority partnership in media ownership this cannot happen
7637585 there are miserable creatures like you in every administration who dont have the guts to speak up or quit if there are disagreements with the boss or colleagues
7637586 no your type soaks up the benefits of power revels in the limelight for years then quits and spurred on by greed cashes in with a scathing critique
7637587 when the money starts rolling in you should donate it to a worthy cause something like biting the hand that fed me another thought is to weasel your way back into the white house if a democrat is elected that would provide a good set up for a second book deal in a few years
7637588 what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
7637589 ironically in todays dollars that amount is worth exactly 30 pieces of silver
7637590 we have said over and over that the intelligence was wrong and we have worked very hard at president bushs direction to change the way the intelligence community works together but what hurts us is the suggestion that we purposefully sent men and women into war without acknowledging the consequences
7637591 that would have taken integrity and courage but then you would have had credibility and your complaints could have been aired objectively youre a hot ticket now but dont you deep down feel like a total ingrate
7637592 men are 10 times more scared of marrying the wrong person than of never getting married at all
7637593 this is the first generation of people who have grown up with bad divorces people assume there is something wrong if you dont marry but these are men who have made a different choice and not given in to social pressures
7637594 so why have you never been married ten insights into why he hasnt wed
7637595 its so important to these men to get it right my best advice to single women after bachelors is to be patient if youre in a hurry to get married youll be frustrated
7637596 those with little money said they would have nothing to offer a partner with some suffering self esteem issues and withdrawing from the dating pool
7637597 while those who are financially sound were terrified what a bad divorce could do to them
7637598 a compelling issue was how many of them had found contentment in a never married life
7637599 they had created lives full of careers friends and ambitions it was not like they walk around all day worried about not being married
7637600 now were looking at getting married as i researched the book i found i was looking at men 10 years older than me and it was like looking into the future if i didnt change nothing would
7637601 their lungs fill with fluid and they can no longer breathe
7637602 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7637603 i imagine nothing would keep him away from a democratic convention
7637604 tonight will be an opportunity for the american people to be introduced to senator obama once again to learn about his values from people who know him best
7637605 the story of barack obama is firmly rooted in the american tradition
7637606 i am asking you to those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me during the primary
7637607 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are gonna do
7637608 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
7637609 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7637610 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president
7637611 its always a little bit sad when were removing something from the basket thats been there for decades

7637624 man we dont got anything no money no place to live no car all we gots is your daughter and we have to feed her and cloth her and stuff

7637637 this is a serious issue rightly rated critical by red hat and while there may not be cases of widespread exploitation of it it does require prompt and direct response i think red hat is doing that and in the end i think this issue will be highlighted by the companys response
7637638 that would be very bad indeed although red hat says that no updates appear to have been compromised
7637639 the debian openssl issue was another significant security matter both illustrate some of the security concerns internal breaches or code corruption that may be more specific to open source
7637640 most enterprise users of linux and open source software are coming to trust it and increase their use in general i dont think this will impact that trend
7637641 red hat customers have cause to be aware and to be concerned but with any enterprise grade operating system there are going to be security issues this is why i believe it is the vendors response that is most critical customers are being kept aware and updated with patches so i would say the issue is being handled adequately
7637642 the people were genuinely concerned about the boundary issue because they felt that it was directly related to the security of the country a clear boundary is like a wall protecting the precious gem
7637643 we learnt from the militant problems in the south that if we do not act in time the problem will only deteriorate the other members of the house the samdrup jongkhar chimi yonten thinley said that more and more people believed that the security and independence of the country was at stake and the issue was also raised in the 83rd and 84th sessions when we informed the house that the chinese had already constructed six roads to our northern border some of them even crossing the border the people were shocked
7637644 the updated treaty reiterates that there shall be perpetual peace and friendship between india and bhutan

7637916 the spirit of monarchy then is nothing but the craving in the human mind after the sensible and the one it is not so much a matter of state necessity or policy as a natural infirmity a disease a false appetite in the popular feeling which must be gratified man is an individual animal with narrow faculties but infinite desires which he is anxious to concentrate in some one object within the grasp of his imagination and where if he cannot be all that he wishes himself to be he may at least contemplate his own pride vanity and passions displayed in their most extravagant dimensions in a being no bigger and no better than himself
7637917 each individual would be a king a god but as he cannot the next best thing is to see a reflex image of his own self love darling passion of his breast realized embodied out of himself in the first object he can lay his hands on for the purpose
7637918 the worthlessness of the object does not diminish but irritate the propensity to admire it serves to pamper our imagination equally and does not provoke our envy all we want is to aggrandize our own vainglory at second hand and the less of real superiority or excellence there is in the person we fix upon as our proxy in this dramatic exhibition the more easily can we change places with him and fancy ourselves as good as he nay the descent favours the rise and we heap our tribute of applause the higher in proportion as it is a free gift an idol is not the worse for being made of coarse materials a king should be a common place man otherwise he is superior in his own nature and not dependent on our bounty or caprice

7638016 its something that students have been asking for for years now so generally students are very happy towards this step being taken in improving access to post secondary education
7638017 this really announces our first national system of grants in canada
7638018 because its now a federal program thats managed by the department of human resources and social development it allows for greater transparency and accountability and also allows for greater improvement
7638019 i think its clear we have to educate people more broadly than just university
7638020 we think this new approach on the one hand is sufficiently tough that we get our money back but on the other hand is fair and allows people to dig out of the hole so they can actually afford to pay us back
7638021 the gap between spending in canada by foreign residents and spending in foreign countries by canadians is steadily growing at canadas expense
7638022 whats more with the canadian dollar expected to remain close to current levels over the entire forecast horizon the travel deficit is expected to continue to widen
7638023 also by encouraging conference planners to relocate events to destinations with weaker currencies the high dollar may also have an adverse effect on business travel
7638024 weather will always beckon canadian travellers to warmer climes but a near parity canadian dollar and a u s economic slump has put a huge dent into canadas ability to attract american tourists
7638025 judged by data on the number of travellers crossing each way the travel deficit does not seem to have worsened much further in the second quarter
7638026 but that pause may not last given americans money troubles and new passport requirements for those crossing by car
7638027 overall we expect the current account to post a surplus of roughly 7 8 billion in the quarter
7638028 domestic tourism spending remains strong bolstered by solid growth in disposable income and strong labour markets
7638029 tax cuts continue to boost disposable income among canadians and bolster corporate profits helping to fuel growth in both leisure and business travel
7638030 however given the strength of the canadian dollar it has become clear that not all of the increase in canadians travel budgets will be spent here but instead will be used for trips going to the united states or other international destinations
7638031 the unemployment rate among many tourism industries has approached or dropped below record lows in nearly every provinces
7638032 labour market tightness is also exerting upward pressure on wages in the sector and is hurting the sectors profitability

7638037 experiences like this one can only help build the character of our student athletes and give them a sense of responsibility in giving back to the community
7638038 most of villanovas extended community service trips take place during breaks in the academic calendar when sports are in session
7638039 we had talked for a while about leading a trip when most athletes are free and the timing that made the most sense was right after finals
7638040 because we worked with student athletes from different teams i have a better sense of not just representing my team but the whole university the experience in that environment made me feel like part of a bigger family
7638041 the experience of a trip like this gives you a great appreciation for what you have whether in your personal life or here on campus
7638042 each of us felt that we reached out and helped someone in particular we met the family the house is being built for and worked side by side with them
7638043 people who have done trips with habitat for humanity in the past have said that working on some of the smaller details of the house doesnt allow as much of a chance to see the fruits of your labor
7638044 we took that advice and chose a site with that in mind the framing of the house in charleston had started on may 3 and we were there a week later
7638045 it was a great experience to be able to work together and do something good for this family but the trip also helped to build the sense of community among all of us from villanova
7638046 because we worked with student athletes from different teams i have a better sense of not just representing my team but the whole university the experience in that environment made me feel like part of a bigger family
7638047 it was a unique experience for us to be in a group setting that wasnt just our own team
7638048 we do a lot with the soccer team but this was a much broader experience that brought us all together working with other student athletes in general i felt that we all got along and understood each other better because of this trip
7638049 the trips last for a week and the group is given a day off to tour around the area we tried to go somewhere that would be a destination sight with some sightseeing opportunities for the student athletes as well
7638050 there are some rural areas we could have gone but charleston provided a really good opportunity to be involved with habitat for humanity and also be somewhere where we could do some tourist things too
7638051 each of us that took part in the trip had a great time and felt that we did a lot of good
7638052 we worked very hard and were physically exhausted at the end of each day but at the same time it was a very fun experience
7638053 i hope that trips such as this one will continue to provide opportunities to bring all the teams together
7638054 all of us now have friends on other teams that normally we wouldnt have gotten to know it was beneficial to have the trip last a whole week and not just for one day

7638089 the obama campaign and the clinton campaign were working together in nevada long before they began to merge if you will nationally

7638091 it is embarrassing to the state and embarrassing to himself he has no solutions i am not surprised by the results
7638092 our play together in recent ryder cups has been pretty good indeed in all our ryder cups i am experienced we have rookies in there at eight nine and ten and a little experience there goes a long way i am playing well obviously
7638093 i am relaxed and there is zero reason for me to worry about things
7638094 i have called captain nick faldo and told him of my decision and hope that my performance so far will earn one of his two wildcard picks
7638095 it has been an extremely difficult decision to take given my burning desire to represent europe again in defending the ryder cup in the united states
7638096 but the fact that boston this week is my only opportunity to qualify for the final two play off events as well as being my final opportunity to play my 15 events on the us pga tour conflicts with my ambition to play gleneagles and earn my spot in the team
7638097 i started out cooking ribs here once a week and everyone said it was the best ribs they ever had
7638098 it brings out a feeling of community by bringing everyone out together
7638099 what we want is for families and kids to come out have fun and create community spirit
7638100 im really excited for her because shes been working really hard
7638101 i know shes going to move mountains and create wonders
7638102 i would have liked to win i did everything i could and i liked the crowd response
7638103 it was a lot of pressure for them and they did their best now they know what it takes to go forward and bring their musical career to the next level
7638104 i want to thank the entire virgin islands for supporting coming out and showing their talent
7638105 this is further evidence that the dejongh administration and the v i police department will not tolerate or attempt to cover up wrongdoing by police officers and other government employees
7638106 we understand that the yhan brothers are innocent until proven guilty however i am confident that the criminal investigation bureau working closely with the attorney generals office has a solid case against these two
7638107 all of the junior high school children are going in with a clean slate
7638108 they will be integrated and not put into a class by themselves
7638109 we must continue the effort to afford every child in the virgin islands the education they deserve
7638110 the work we do now on their behalf will lay the foundation for a bright future for every one of our students
7638111 one of the things were trying to stress is we cant do everything
7638112 we want to raise the standards and stretch our learning standards
7638113 were just hoping the entire community will come together and will work together so we can have a truly splendid school year
7638114 you walk into the classroom and this is the first thing to be greeted with
7638115 the classroom may not be as well decorated as i would like but im still going to be here teaching
7638116 some students give a hard time but others are willing to learn im ready to teach and move on
7638117 i hope to make new friends i found most of my classes already
7638118 im looking for a good experience its a lot different
7638119 its a big school i hope i can find my classes
7638120 i just hope all my teachers are going to be fired up to do their best for the children and that our school will continue to excel
7638121 i always try to do better than the year before im looking forward to working with them on a more individual basis
7638122 we dont stop come the first day of school we continue to do work as time permits at various schools
7638123 the road is heavily traveled now and its going to be even worse
7638124 there will be problems with students crossing streets to go back and forth to the main campus
7638125 we decided to take the worst schools to visit first
7638126 i would have hoped that the worse schools were the ones they put more emphasis on but it didnt appear to me that that happened
7638127 the schools will open but there will be some challenges in some respective area some will have electrical challenges some will have some leaking problems some will have personnel problems
7638128 last year i think they did a better job at opening but it seems like more is being done this time
7638129 in the last two weeks weve had six resignations on st croix and seven resignations on st thomas were getting one or two a day
7638130 give us some notice so we can serve the children properly
7638131 a number of paraprofessionals graduated this year and will join our force
7638132 a number of teachers who were not qualified were placed out of their subject areas
7638133 we made a very conscious effort to see what staff could have been transferred
7638134 it takes away from my time and from my being an instructional leader at this school
7638135 we had to prioritize the money according to the seriousness of the project
7638136 whatever is not done is not going to hamper the students from learning anything
7638137 we dont have much to work with but we try our best
7638138 these facilities dont belong to us its a joint effort by everyone parents need to make sure your child dont come to school and destroy property
7638139 for the most part i know were in pretty good shape to start the school year
7638140 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 percent perhaps a boy awaits us

7638142 logan should have these choices it doesnt have to be batman on every screen
7638143 outdoor retailer summer market underscored what is right with this industry
7638144 we saw incredible energy creativity and the strength of community that differentiates us from other business categories manufacturers introduced gear apparel and accessories featuring the latest technology at excellent price points designed to resonate with cautious consumers and to make it easier for people to experience the outdoors for the first time
7638145 according to preliminary numbers attendance was on par with summer market 2007 though this was the largest number of exhibitors in the history of the event

7638155 were optimistic that iraq and the us can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for us troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7638156 that will continue to be a goal of the united states to be able to turn over those responsibilities to an ever increasing capable and equipped iraqi security force
7638157 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation

7638176 russia needs to respect the territorial independence and sovereignty of georgia
7638177 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia relations cannot be returned to their former state
7638178 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7638179 we would like these relations to be comprehensive and in the spirit of partnership
7638180 but if they in effect tear up that cooperation then nothing terrible will happen to us

7638196 the iphone can download music only over wi fi or by syncing to a pc not over 3g network
7638197 theres not a large probability at all of having a deficit this year
7638198 given the short term inflexibility inherent in expenditures it is likely that the government would run its first budgetary deficit in over a decade
7638199 i dont think there is anything in the numbers that would indicate a deficit would be a good bet
7638200 i am very calm i know i am doing my job well

7638207 the horrors of the second world war gave impetus to a quest for universal peace justice and human dignity with the united nations at the fore it is a disturbing commentary on our quest that as we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights palestinians mark six decades of what they refer to as the nakba or catastrophe with many languishing in conditions of exile exclusion and isolation this is a testament to our collective failure to give meaning to human dignity for palestinians and to achieve a lasting just peace in the middle east we who serve palestine refugees believe that there is time to make amends exile for sixty years palestine refugees have been in exile from their ancestral lands nowhere is this more starkly visible than in the west bank where the illegal barrier hundreds of checkpoints and physical obstructions daily reinforce the exile and in gaza the policies of closure and indiscriminate punishment devastate lives causing mass despair threatening to destroy hopes for peace exclusion palestine refugees also face exclusion from the justice afforded by international law the aim of which is to offer the protection security and dignity taken for granted in a world where respect for human rights and the rule of law have become guiding principles of global governance embodied in the canons of international law are clear prohibitions against systematic attacks against civilian populations against deliberately depriving civilians of food against the intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure and against the transfer of an occupying powers population onto the land it occupies the violations of these and other provisions serve to underscore among palestinians a sense of exclusion from the protection of the international system

7638209 nothing in this section affects the powers of the governor general including the power to dissolve parliament at the governor generals discretion

7638212 fixed election dates stop leaders from trying to manipulate the calendar simply for partisan political advantage
7638213 unless were defeated or prevented from governing we want to keep moving forward to make this minority parliament work over the next three years
7638214 there are many people in canada who would claim that become is the wrong verb there
7638215 since hes committed himself to the four year fixed term and fixed election date it requires some face saving arrangement which he can argue is plausible for calling an election sooner

7638223 we sell newspapers on it and a whole lot of other stuff and i understand that
7638224 theres always a bit of fire wheres theres smoke around but i think to suggest the guy wasnt going to go back on the field because he was feigning injury is taking it just a tad too far
7638225 if he went back on the field he was only going to let someone down
7638226 we didnt expect to see him back after halftime but we stood him up a few times and nearly sent him on when michael jennings went down
7638227 but to send him out there half busted when the game wasnt on the line would have been an unintelligent thing to do as a coach

7638259 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7638260 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7638261 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
7638262 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
7638263 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him

7638310 the rta is working closely with the office of british rail for the palm monorails inspection and eventually certification process once the palm monorail system is connected with the dubai metro tourists will be able to leave dubai international airport on the metro and continue through to the palm jumeirah where they change over to the monorail system and move onwards to their hotel

7638315 if you jump sooner then you can hope to get a position in his new government you jump later he may not even pick you
7638316 the umno machinery has been playing up ethnic sentiments to its height they openly compare chinese as pigs
7638317 you never do that publicly never put that in a campaign and this time around umno used that in a malay area hoping that would push up the malay support to create that sense that if you have anwar winning the chinese and the indians are going to dominate the country
7638318 packed with armed men wearing police and security forces uniforms hit us with rocket propelled grenades and machine guns
7638319 they were surprised by heavy gunfire from within the camp there was an exchange of fire and a number of victims
7638320 if government forces carry out more attacks against our people the sla is ready to confront and retaliate

7638328 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case anymore
7638329 it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men
7638330 if ever a time should come when vain and aspiring men shall possess the highest seats in government our country will stand in need of its experienced patriots to prevent its ruin
7638331 these are the times that try mens souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered

7638356 we believe this partnership will add convenience to the members of our joint membership when the merger is completed all free state and cujc members will be able to access any of our six branches two satellite locations and a worldwide network of fee free atms

7638371 durante la reuni n se reiter que en ning n caso ha habido discriminaci n hacia cemex pero s una actitud distinta a la que tuvieron holcim o lafarge que se mantienen en sociedad con nosotros

7638380 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7638381 there will be some thunderstorms in the area tonight but the higher risk for severe weather will be tomorrow and wednesday
7638382 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more freedom of speech freedom of religion while the world was watching
7638383 so i would say perhaps were disappointed that they didnt take the full opportunity that was offered to them while the world was watching during these olympics

7638385 this four year period weve got 38 i dont know what that means

7638418 i grew up in america in the era of title ix and soccer seemed the most natural sport to take to afghanistan i also thought that because it was an internationally known sport that everybody played there would not be a bias against girls playing the sport
7638419 not knowing exactly what i was doing i still managed to get the sport started for girls in afghanistan doing this changed the direction of my life
7638420 the sport was not played by girls in any of the communities where they lived these girls turned out to be some of the best ambassadors for the sport and it has enabled them to be pioneers of the sport
7638421 it was a wonderful series of events you see that you can make a difference and you just try to play a small part in making that difference
7638422 i tell all of them how proud i am of them they are amazing soccer players none of them ever played soccer before
7638423 now it is really amazing to see them play today especially the ones who played on the afghanistan national womens team in kabul
7638424 this allows girls to see that others like themselves can play the game as a result there is a peer to peer connection
7638425 not knowing exactly what i was doing i still managed to get the sport started for girls in afghanistan doing this changed the direction of my life
7638426 the book is about my life coming here as an immigrant and the impact that soccer has had on the members of that original group of girls from afghanistan

7638464 hacer canciones tiene algo de terap utico lo mismo que le pasa a los que escriben diarios de vida aunque yo no soy tan honestamente brutal como dir a calamaro
7638465 tambi n me motivan otras cosas como libros pel culas vidas de otra gente por ah hay personas que ni saben que he escrito sobre ellas

7638480 we are not in an environment to take undue risks
7638481 one of the major reasons the protests snowballed to the levels weve seen
7638482 is that we allowed hard line islamists to run of the city allowing them to use mosques to broadcast appeals for people to come out on the streets our withdrawal also allowed them to pressure people otherwise unsympathetic to the secessionist cause to join the protests

7638519 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7638520 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
7638521 whether joe biden is as ignorant of what his religion teaches remains to be seen
7638522 so there we have it the man running for president on the democratic ticket supports selective infanticide his running mate is a pro abortion catholic the delegates are wildly out of step with americans on abortion and the speaker of the house hasnt a clue what her religion teaches on the subject
7638523 so goes the dollar so goes the energy complex these days
7638524 the storm is trying to pull the market higher but its not getting much of a boost
7638525 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7638526 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7638527 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7638528 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7638529 will some bodies go unidentified i cannot tell you right now but it is a possibility
7638530 in general the company was fine and no problems whatsoever were detected

7638535 in doing so this company has fallen far short of meeting the high business standards that iowans expect
7638536 there will be no industrial jungles in iowa on my watch
7638537 in the end we are certain that the governor will see firsthand that our plant is anything but a jungle and that when all the bitterness of the last few months is taken out of the equation that we are indeed on a course to being on an even higher road
7638538 this is a case where everyone was so enamored and felt so much sympathy for the holocaust survivor it just overwhelmed everyone in the case including the jury
7638539 now to find out that the book was not true that is fraud on the court
7638540 this credibility issue is something jane is digging up now
7638541 thats not what the trial was about it was about the fact that she cheated us
7638542 she said the reason she was so attached to dogs is because she had been so attached to wolves
7638543 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7638544 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7638545 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7638546 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case
7638547 larry cohen and i have gotten the sequel rights back for maniac cop and were preparing to do a maniac cop 4

7638569 la vulnerabilidad de los controles fronterizos a reos terrestres y mar timos son el principal problema
7638570 hay zonas que parecen intocables como territorio liberado para el narcotr fico por ello los grupos internacionales comenzaron a ver el negocio aqu y naturalmente abrieron sus cocinas
7638571 el laboratorio de drogas que se logr desbaratar en ingeniero maschwitz propiedad de mexicanos fue un golpe importante pero apenas la punta del iceberg de un fen meno lamentable ya instalado en el pa s
7638572 por el tipo de instalaciones que encontraron en la argentina la edad y la procedencia de todos los mexicanos detenidos all y por el destino de los cargamentos de efedrina contrabandeada desde buenos aires quien est instalado en la argentina es el cartel de sinaloa
7638573 para nosotros no es una sorpresa que el cartel de sinaloa llegue a buenos aires en la argentina seguramente hay una fiebre de autorizaciones legales que est n permitiendo el ingreso de sustancias que en un amplio porcentaje no est n destinados a la industria de los medicamentos
7638574 el gobierno es consciente de lo que est pasando nosotros le pedimos una reuni n al embajador de los estados unidos earl wayne y hablamos con tony grecco el representante de la dea para que aporten informaci n

7638592 nos est n llamando y criticando por mostrar los rostros de los que agredieron al comandante en pat no estamos de acuerdo con la violencia
7638593 lo que ha ocurrido hoy en santa cruz es el inicio de lo que parece ser un plan una escalada de actos violentos que ya lo han anunciado algunos dirigentes c vicos para el martes 29 de la pr xima semana convocando a un paro y dijeron que lo haran respetar por la fuerza de la violencia
7638594 los discapacitados fueron utilizados como punta de lanza de una movilizaci n y por detr s de ellos ven an los c vicos diputados de podemos y unionistas
7638595 estaban azuzando la violencia para agredir a una de las instituciones m s importantes del pa s como es la polic a nacional
7638596 por lo que cualquier intento de neutralizar agredir o reemplazar a una instituci n como la polic a nacional ser un intento destinado al fracaso

7638599 la mal llamada libertad de comercio es una libertad que enjaula y una gran mentira porque es el nombre que el norte del mundo da a todo lo que no practica pero es todo lo que predica y como el paraguay de los l pez cometi el grave pecado de proteger sus propios productos e impedir el paso de la avalancha de los productos brit nicos y no se at al cuello la soga de la deuda externa que nos ahorca fue castigado

7638608 the credit crisis is more than a year old and still there are lots and lots of issues
7638609 investor psychology is certainly suffering from credit crisis fatigue people are disappointed that the situation is not visibly improving
7638610 clearly there is no light at the end of the housing tunnel yet
7638611 the supply of unsold homes is still very high suggesting theres going to be downward pressure on prices well into 2009

7638661 many have invested in as far as brazil and liberia
7638662 the bank is cautiously optimistic despite the external headwinds from the us subprime issue and rising commodity prices
7638663 we find of course that our economy is not totally de coupled from the impact on the us economy we also see that consumers are more aware of what the risks are and people are more skewed towards deposit structured and capital protected products
7638664 if we can mitigate the risks we could go back to bank negara malaysia bnm and have it reinstate the approval
7638665 indicators such as the producer price index continue to show that businesses are still facing rising operating costs however competitive pressures and slowing demand are likely to contain the pass through to consumer prices
7638666 we only take into account the economic monetary and financial conditions in determining our interest rate policy
7638667 because of the increasingly fierce competition we dont expect the business performance there to improve in the future

7638677 here is a small fraction of the breads available any day at zingermans samples are available i tried a chocolate cherry bread that was weird and wonderful but it was the big pain de montagne that sent me to my knees in worshipful ecstasy
7638678 adjoining the original deli is a coffee shop known as zingermans next door it was here i found this cherry pecan danish to go with my excellent strong coffee

7638690 these pieces also help keep my book more visible and i usually notice an increase in sales especially on amazon each time a new one hits the stands
7638691 to me its all about keeping your name out there
7638692 a column gives readers a chance to know you and to get a sense of your work
7638693 for sure our written words translate into book sales product sales speaking engagements and more
7638694 while all this was happening i was appearing on an nbc tv show in orlando i found out about the msn columns popularity on my blackberry told the shows producer and i was asked to discuss the columns topic on a future show written visibility is the best calling card you have
7638695 there are so many different people here thats whats really cool
7638696 i think the area where we spent the most attention was how to actually write the health care plank because clinton had proposed that it be an actual mandate to purchase health care and obama had not were all in agreement that there needs to be healthcare coverage for every man woman and child in the united states
7638697 the united nations urges restraint and calls for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that the injured may be evacuated
7638698 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7638699 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7638700 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7638701 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties up to now we have 27 confirmed dead and 75 wounded
7638702 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7638703 we called off regular patrols in kalma because it is not part of our mandate to search for arms and arrest individuals
7638704 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7638705 a unamid police and military force accessed the camp and we are prepared for possible assistance in the case of evacuating any type of casualties

7638708 if like me your itunes library is an unholy mess id suggest you give it a spin
7638709 dupin is just so cool because it eliminates one of lifes little bummers its like it cleans the debris off your beach
7638710 other software fails to handle huge libraries and certainly is not as easy to use or as flexible as dupin if you have a need to rearrange and organize your itunes music library no other application gives you as many options as dupin
7638711 great product and easy to use dupins already found hundreds of duplicates that i never knew existed
7638712 the itunes solution is no solution at all seeing as most of its returns are alternative versions of the same song off of entirely different albums dupin solves all of this
7638713 get dupes filter and purge of 4000 tunes took a couple of hours saves me at least 5 times that
7638714 i had about 7000 files that were duplicates located on an external drive a lot easier than doing it manually
7638715 ive been struggling with getting rid of thousands of itunes dupes for months i usually go in and get a few at a time and finally thought someone else mustve already figured this out so im sitting here watching the dupes fall one by one its wonderful the purge feature good work
7638716 thanks for a wonderful app it has worked flawlessly sure beats hitting the delete key several hundred times
7638717 this thing is great you have given me my music back i went through about 13 gigs of music that was snarled after changing computers about four times in three years and full of dupes quads and near dupes dupin went through it all in about 10 minutes
7638718 great tool i had a boat load of duplicates because i consolidated my library with a duplicate of my itunes library what a nightmare dupin solved my problem very efficiently thanks
7638719 could not be more clear about their support for my candidacy
7638720 there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters who were going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7638721 but if you take a look this week i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7638722 you may not think twice about posting your grandfathers name but youve just released your mothers maiden name
7638723 there are a lot of places where you can claim to forget other questions and the site will default to mothers maiden name if i give you the login to one account ive essentially given you a fish if i give you the answer to peoples password recovery questions ive taught you to fish you can pillage their accounts
7638724 it was tough because two weeks ago i went from cincinnati to beijing 12 hours and went 12 more hours to new york
7638725 its tough but i dont want to think about that
7638726 im just going to try to recover from a whole lot of traveling weve had
7638727 you do a lot of prevention you know stretching massage and a lot of sleep eat healthy kind of thing
7638728 well im still trying to get over the jet lag
7638729 venus seems like she isnt having a problem but i dont handle jet lag as well as she does hopefully it wont be an issue
7638730 we got here thursday i really dont know what day it is anymore
7638731 i thought today was friday but im here at the right time
7638732 yesterday i was trying to go to sleep but i mean i couldnt because i was watching the closing ceremony
7638733 you know my mind is still there i was trying to stay focused as possible as i could and the court was not easy i think the first round is never easy
7638734 for my sake being able to get two tournaments getting matches in and at least playing my way into shape a little bit after the injuries was probably a good move as far as my tennis goes
7638735 each time i play a grand slam i always think that oh this could be my last time playing here
7638736 ive obviously learned that i have no idea what the future kind of holds and what will happen and i dont make decisions for the future any more from this day that im living in
7638737 but im so excited to be back here i didnt think i would be back playing you never know how many more chances youll get to be playing here
7638738 its obviously been a battle this year and a battle that its been hard to fight
7638739 i really dont have any performance goals because i dont know really what will happen my biggest thing is i feel like if i can stay healthy i give myself a chance to do well
7638740 i dont know what well kind of means any more but im just shooting to play well and today was a good step
7638741 just to be on this journey with my son has been quite exciting and memorable and i have a good time with that
7638742 the kid has no idea if ive won or lost he napped through my whole match today in the hotel but for me and husband john its all about having him along with us every step of the way
7638743 we had some growing pains then and were going to need some help now
7638744 we can simplify what they do back there much easier
7638745 you can never say we proved we can play with them
7638746 i dont want that to be our confidence level because i dont think you gain confidence just from playing them close
7638747 and were not there yet i want to make sure that we dont walk into that stadium with a false sense of security or false confidence just because we played them close a year ago
7638748 the fear of getting your brains beat in is an unbelievable motivator
7638749 a ton of the players will take more belief with them
7638750 part of the team kind of went into the game unsure of about what was to happen
7638751 youre walking into the teeth of the opening of your season
7638752 are going to have to step onto the field and theyre going to have to mature in a hurry
7638753 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7638754 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7638755 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7638756 there have been some from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7638757 its obviously not easy to be a family when you have two working parents and one travelling
7638758 well have to see how i feel if theres any motivation how it affects everybody thats involved with us and take it from there
7638759 ive obviously learned that i have no idea what the future kind of holds and what will happen
7638760 im so excited to be back here i didnt think i would be back playing you never know how many more chances youll get to be playing here
7638761 i was just so fortunate to be able to walk on the grounds i cant believe the usta let me have a wildcard ill never forget this day
7638762 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7638763 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7638764 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7638765 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7638766 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7638767 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7638768 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7638769 there is a lot of excitement having an sec football team coming to ruston
7638770 its a national tv game and these are the kind of games that we certainly want to be in as a program i feel like weve had a good camp and well see if were ready to play
7638771 our conditions were uncomfortable but because were westerners we suffered absolutely nothing compared to what the tibetan people suffer
7638772 they asked about our actions our roles about our lives everything from where i went to high school to everything i ate in china
7638773 it was the scariest it was beyond anything i could imagine in a movie
7638774 they run the spread and were excited i definitely think were ready we may not be returning a lot of starters but everyone last year was a solid backup and we got a lot of playing time so experience we dont feel like is a big issue
7638775 ball state offered me i talked to one of their coaches coach hecklinski he said they wanted to be the first to offer me it was a lot of a relief i guess now im just waiting for more to come in
7638776 i know a kid from my school went there a couple years ago
7638777 i know they have a pretty good program there theyve been recruiting me for a couple of months
7638778 whoever it was had to know plumbing because they did a clean job taking it off
7638779 people want to know that this is something that is going to be solved
7638780 nancy cant speak for herself so the community is speaking for her
7638781 we hear things we havent heard before and by the neighbors and communities staying focused keeping us on our toes it helps a lot
7638782 we know that the best gift we could give nancy coopers family and our community is to bring an end to this terrible period in their lives and were working hard each day with this in mind
7638783 seeing them down broken and walked on its frustrating not to be able to fix them all
7638784 both of these were pushed over flat charles broke in half
7638785 to get him put and straightened and to leave her lying on the ground just didnt seem right
7638786 his last words to his comrades as they sadly gathered around him were press on my brave boys
7638787 i hear from the coaches at eastern michigan illinois and east carolina
7638788 illinois has offered me a verbal scholarship so far they are still going through their evaluation but they love me and want my tape
7638789 eastern michigan is going to have a meeting and theyd let my coach know the situation from there
7638790 ive only been in touch with illinois and eastern michigan i like the ones who are showing me love
7638791 i do plan to send my tape to other schools this season including maryland ecu richmond and pittsburgh
7638792 with all of the bad raps that run rampant across the net i wanted to at least mention that since day one the foundation for the pure spanish horse has always had a policy of
7638793 music for teenagers who dont run away or if they do run away its not far they go to the park at midnight with their only friend or meet up with the local goths to smoke pot and listen to kmfdm
7638794 well im not sure if the pains of being pure at heart is quite as uncomfortable as being a boy with a thorn in your side or having an exploding heart
7638795 but we do get a lot of angina ads and biblical quotes if you google our name we want our music to make you feel good or otherwise
7638796 we all really just like the music and were having the best time of our lives and thats way more cool then being cool
7638797 i told them its really cool its neat to be ranked but theres a danger there obviously
7638798 the danger is that players start chalking up a good season before youve played the first game and thats certainly not what you want i think our players understand weve got a lot of work to do
7638799 i told our players weve got a good football team but that doesnt guarantee a good season
7638800 youve got a guy that realizes he doesnt have to be a rock star he doesnt have to be the guy he just has to be a guy that doesnt get us beat i wouldnt want his goals to be set on being better statistically than last year id like for his goals to be set on winning more games than last year
7638801 you cant go into a situation thinking or expecting bad things to happen
7638802 de knvb heeft ons gepolst en daarop hebben wij de gemeente en de provincie ge nformeerd daar is men enthousiast over de plannen om het stadion geschikt te maken voor een eventueel wk dat moet dan naar 44 000 zitplaatsen terwijl we nu op 26 000 zitten we hebben al met de architect gepraat
7638803 technisch gezien zijn we er toe in staat de grote vraag is alleen is het financieel ook mogelijk in september hebben we opnieuw overleg met de gemeente en de provincie en voor 1 januari moeten we een goed onderbouwd plan bij de knvb hebben liggen we zijn er serieus mee bezig maar dan moet het wk natuurlijk nog wel aan nederland worden toegewezen en die beslissing valt pas in 2011

7638826 a few years ago i was introduced to ncmec by a friend of mine and i went to a speaking event that they had where a woman shared a story about her child that was missing and their search for him it really was an eye opener for me
7638827 just the reality of how someone loses a family member a child and the fact that she was still searching for him my fianc e erin and i just looked at each other because we want to have kids one day and couldnt imagine going through that we knew we wanted to help and got on board right there
7638828 every little bit helps whether its one dollar or 10 000 it may not sound like a lot but it can really help somebody
7638829 i was amazed at the number of registered sex offenders out there and its not even that number that is the scariest part

7638911 was the person who told obama insisted he should run for president
7638912 ok lets run lets try to win lets put our chips in the middle of the table and see how we do
7638913 one reason we won is we didnt have a playbook on the shelf we were making it up as we went along
7638914 one of the most beautiful and audacious parks in america
7638915 many of her top people had little or no real experience in presidential campaigning
7638916 was told that patti solis doyle stayed in her office watching soap operas and refused to return the phone calls of governors members of congress and bill clinton i was told that there were suspicions that mark penn the campaigns pollster and chief strategist cooked the books in presenting his polling results
7638917 we assumed they clinton political aides knew what they were doing they didnt know jack
7638918 i talked to hillary in nevada a caucus state before an event and i thought venom was going to shoot from her mouth she hated caucuses they underrepresented the working poor her supporters had jobs to go to they were waitresses and day care workers we should have fixed the rules the caucus system skews to the wealthy she said but the bottom line is the rules are the rules we looked like whiny babies
7638919 people didnt know about superdelegates nobody figured it out they thought it was all about winning states and not delegates that was mark penn he was always talking about national polls he was preoccupied with them
7638920 there was a lack of experience knowledge and appreciation of the role of delegates the delegate operation was viewed as completely separate from the political operation this coupled with a very weak extraordinarily weak staff was the real fault of the campaign
7638921 some of those in attendance at the retreat felt the campaign was lacking something an actual plan to win the democratic nomination for president
7638922 it was eye opening the political and field operations were dysfunctional there was not enough staff the staff that existed was too junior and there was no plan there was no political or field plan on how to win the nomination
7638923 there was plenty of discussion in the spring of 2007 about her apologizing for her war vote but she didnt want to apologize because she didnt think she had made a mistake and from a political standpoint apologizing would have been inconsistent with her strength and experience message
7638924 mark penn did not believe in it and we always had to keep an eye towards the general election in a general election her support for the war would have been great
7638925 for the last 16 years she had been portrayed as the caricature of a tough bitch
7638926 ironically our early research found the hillary attributes that tested the highest were masculine
7638927 as first lady and in her senate office she had a very female centric matriarchal environment
7638928 who was being wooed furiously by both clinton and obama declined a meeting with hillarys campaign team saying
7638929 we went to her and we said look you showed your human side in new hampshire and it worked so lets keep doing that and she still didnt want to do it
7638930 obama had people willing to lay on railroad tracks for him and we had old ladies on oxygen tanks we had to work twice as hard to get over the enthusiasm gap
7638931 barack obama had only to do one message here is who i am we had to do two messages one hi i am not the mean cold hearted bitch who screwed up health care and two here is who i am
7638932 a guy dressed as gandalf from lord of the rings with an obama video playing on his staff
7638933 the campaign competed in south carolina because the clintons chiefly bill insisted on competing there
7638934 competing in south carolina was bigger than any mark penn blunder and bigger than the experience versus her softer side blunder it was the central decision that lost the election

7639013 from day one our focus has always been on the educational component during the week and the heroes day celebration on sept 13

7639044 those things are basically predetermined its just that what the defense does youre going to react to it
7639045 you can really see a lot better upstairs and see them spinning from one coverage to the next or showing a blitz and things of that nature
7639046 those are the things that coach gundy is relying on us for the eyes in the sky
7639047 being in my office and dealing with all the other issues is not fun but going in there and coaching offense is fun thats why im back involved

7639092 validate processes including sterilization for a device purporting to be sterile
7639093 an alternative to sterility testing for supporting the continued capability of containers to maintain sterility
7639094 might include any properly validated physical or chemical container and closure system integrity test e g bubble tests pressure vacuum decay trace gas permeation leak tests dye penetration tests seal force or electrical conductivity and capacitance tests etc or microbiological container and closure system integrity tests e g microbial challenge or immersion tests such tests may be more useful than sterility testing in demonstrating the potential for product contamination over the products shelf life or dating period
7639095 the advantages of using such container and closure system integrity tests in lieu of sterility tests in the stability protocol for sterile products include
7639096 1 such alternate methods may detect a breach of the container and or closure system prior to product contamination
7639097 2 some of the alternate methods used to evaluate container and closure integrity can conserve samples that may be used for other stability tests
7639098 3 alternative test methods may require less time than sterility test methods which require at least seven days incubation and
7639099 4 the potential for false positive results may be reduced with some alternative test methods when compared to sterility tests

7639187 well i had my first pair of decks when i was 15 or i was into hip hop and got my first pair of technics on my 18th birthday i was a breakdancer and i did graffiti when i was going shopping in birmingham buying my hip hop stuff these new records were how i got into house music
7639188 thats a bit of hard one its just an interest in music i have always been into music when we were at school and hip hop came out i was always the person who had the stereo playing tapes it was just a fascination with music in my opinion its the djs who create the music at the end of the day they are defining whats happening when the scene took off i was already a dj i was already into house music or techno or whatever it was when it first came out it was never really an ambition like oh i wanna be a dj it just kind of happened simply because i was into music

7639218 kyle is still viable in the mix hes had really good practices all through training camp wed like to play him also in the game
7639219 i think hes in the mix because we have two quarterbacks that arent able to practice today
7639220 but the big picture hasnt changed dramatically in the sense that hes still a rookie and weve got two guys that were ahead of him before we came into this situation right before the st louis game

7639231 well if there is a block like this in jacksonville then there must be one in every american city
7639232 i see myself taking part in a lot of outreach getting people further educated about whats going on
7639233 in fact what we seen the democrats doing is similar to what the republicans are doing theyre marching in step
7639234 we can see that in the ongoing pledge to support the war in iraq and push for war against iran there arent many democrats pushing against it in a serious way obama hasnt theres still a push for futher military involvement in the middle east
7639235 until they actually act on their promises for making this better all the talk about hope i think its important that people are on the streets to show the world that there are people in this country who are opposed to what our government is doing
7639236 the police used orange construction netting and basically just blocked everybody in the area and anybody caught was arrested
7639237 but with all the repression and the clampdown thats been happening you have to prepare for the worst case scenario
7639238 on the one hand george bush expresses concern about chinas human rights policies but were seein the same thing happening in denver and now its the democrats doing in this time
7639239 for the united states the source of our values has been the american christians understanding of the bible
7639240 in any society there exists a somewhat mysterious consensus which changes over the decades
7639241 the consensus has no obvious connection with religion it extends however to most religious people whether or not they
7639242 modern morality wherever else it comes from does not come from the bible
7639243 my senator is not representing the needs of the people
7639244 im saying as a believer in a loving god and the god of creation that there is a complexity to all this that makes it work that we cannot understand that we cannot really control that we cannot destroy and that we really cant alter in its massive complexity i believe in the god of creation and i believe as such that were insignificant in all this i am just as a human being offended by the notion that the automobile i drive and the way i air condition my home and the way i barbeque outside i refuse to believe that a loving god creates creatures able to do everything we are able to do to solve various problems that that is going to lead to an apocalypse
7639245 knowing the size and complexity of the natural world we cannot understand or control or destroy or alter its massive complexity im offended by the notion that my automobile or my air conditioner can have any impact on a world that is as old and complex as ours is
7639246 in the context of my belief that god is a loving god and created all that is for beautiful and wonderful reasons and that we are turning this creation into what its never been before in terms of the quality of human life i dont see how that can lead to destruction of what god created
7639247 but at the same time i dont believe that that loving god would create a being like me or you who could conceive of such a place as paradise or heaven or whatever you want to call it if it werent true that would be an ultimate act of cruelty
7639248 if this system gets through yucatan channel into the gulf it could be a troublemaker
7639249 institutional christianity seems fearful of inquiry fearful of freedom fearful of knowledge indeed fearful of anything except its own repetitious propaganda which has its origins in a world that none of us any longer inhabits
7639250 the two poems i have submitted i think are representative of forces and anxieties always present in my own work concerning aesthetic vision

7639252 a lot of people still have an affinity for john mccain
7639253 they voted for him once and he might be able to take advantage of that
7639254 castle is the story of a mystery writer who advises the new york city police on particularly difficult cases
7639255 the likelihood of having his deficiency is less than one in a million
7639256 he wont have a perfectly normal body but the warts should reduce in size to the point where he could use his hands
7639257 over the course of three to six months the warts should be come smaller and fewer in number he will be living a more normal life
7639258 i would like to bring him to the us to run tests on where his immune condition has come from but i would need funding and to get him a visa as well as someone to cover the costs of the tests
7639259 ive never seen anything like this in my entire career
7639260 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
7639261 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
7639262 it raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight
7639263 the knower of truth should go about the world outwardly stupid like a child a madman or a devil
7639264 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7639265 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7639266 the american lung association is going to add it as a risk factor
7639267 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7639268 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7639269 its a population based study which means that you can make an association but not necessarily a conclusion
7639270 it probably promotes more work in the area of routine household items and things we need to be looking at more prospectively to make a clear cause and effect relationship
7639271 anything that affects air quality negatively is not a good thing
7639272 burning in general and the release of smoke these things are certainly to be avoided at the very least chemical irritants will set off asthma and thats reversible cancer is not reversible
7639273 this is not unlike the type of risk that one experiences from secondhand tobacco smoke

7639296 muslims are not a race they belong to a worldwide ideological movement which is faith based and deeply political what we should really be concerned about is not their numbers though their numbers are growing but their psychological and physical strength
7639297 if you consider youre talking about europe that were dealing with very small minorities here youve got a minority among them which refuses to accept our values

7639311 when ah hei shops at the owner automatically brings out the freshest bean sprouts from the barrel in the back room not for her the ready wrapped ones in a plastic bag she rejects a dozen chinese cabbages before finally accepting one that still glistens with morning dew
7639312 and from that little hole the kitchen which would make an american shudder with disgust madame ollangnier turned out daily two of the finest meals i have yet eaten but cooks found it impossible to work with madame ollangnier impossible to work at all she was quite unable to trust anyone elses intelligence and very frank in commenting on the lack of it always in her highest most fish wifish shriek

7639325 most country stations arent playing the dixie chicks and they arent going to start now
7639326 it will be a good fight among thailand singapore and the philippines
7639327 i cant really say what the winning team score would be
7639328 but after seeing the course today i would say that the individual champ would score around 8 to 10 under
7639329 our players will play well on this course because our players learned the game playing on a course similar to this one back home and its relatively short
7639330 of course length off the tees would give one an advantage
7639331 but in a course as slow as this the battle will be won with the short game and our players are very good at this
7639332 luck in the way that you dont get much mud on your ball on your approach shots you cant control a muddied ball
7639333 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket
7639334 hillary supporters are still very upset with the party very upset with the media very upset with the process to the point where i think millions of them will not vote for obama in november
7639335 i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire
7639336 and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama
7639337 can it heal wounds or will it simply reopen them and allow them to stay raw
7639338 if there are people who feel extremely upset they may use the roll call vote and protests as a vehicle for trying to show support for clinton in ways that might hurt the party
7639339 it depends on the quality of her appeal to them
7639340 if they think shes not being genuine theyre not going to move if they think she is sincerely interested in getting obama elected some may come along i doubt she will win over all of them
7639341 were not here to protest and were not here to break the party in half
7639342 the vast majority of our supporters feel like theyre undecided
7639343 the only way the dnc will change is if they lose
7639344 an important part of what im about what makes me tick

7639351 we cant figure out how to write a cap and trade bill that does not cause an immediate spike in natural gas prices
7639352 factories wont compete with utilities to buy gas rather they will move to india and china where there are no pollution controls inevitably worsening global emissions
7639353 i am asking you to those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me during the primary
7639354 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity
7639355 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so
7639356 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
7639357 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7639358 and thats why i have to say i am hillary clinton and i do not approve this message
7639359 neither the parents nor their attorney are informed where melissa is arrested now

7639383 in the process of re establishing herself and her daughter
7639384 i think what she was trying to do was break away from her parents home

7639386 her demeanor is that of a parent who knows her child is safe
7639387 there was concern about implementation but you know if children are missing out on schooling then you have got to do something about that
7639388 like the original this trial is ultimately unsuccessful thus creating an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy
7639389 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
7639390 anonymous submissions made to multiple rumor sites are generally false
7639391 we started the second half a bit slow but its hard to be too critical i just thought our first half was really good
7639392 we expected a tough game out there obviously the panthers probably needed to win tonight to stay alive and i thought our guys handled that really well in the first half
7639393 if someone had of told me at the beginning of the game that would be the score i would have been really happy with that im really surprised actually
7639394 the minor premiership its a really good scalp to have on your belt its a little bit under rated in our game and wed be proud to hold that again
7639395 but weve still got two games to go and we can still finish second or third i think so were just going to concern ourselves with newcastle now well do our revue of this game tomorrow and well go from there

7639451 todays options for acne sufferers are either remarkably outdated such as benzoyl peroxide which has been around since the 1930s or expensive like clinical phototherapy which can cost thousands of dollars
7639452 ansr acne care is a technological advancement in acne treatment that has already changed peoples lives who never thought they would be able to afford having clear skin
7639453 dermatologists at leading research institutions have long touted the benefits of clinical phototherapy for treating acne
7639454 ansr acne care offers acne sufferers an effective in home solution that leverages the benefits of both red and blue light therapy and looks to be a significant improvement in acne treatment thats safe without any side effects
7639455 finding a solution that really works to treat acne can be difficult and frustrating
7639456 ansr is unique because its an acne treatment that capitalizes on the latest technological advances in phototherapy and complements it with specially formulated lotions together they kill acne causing bacteria thin pore clogging sebum and reduce the redness in the areas affected by acne ansr acne care appears to be a paradigm shift in the treatment of acne
7639457 before ansr i tried everything creams antibiotics you name it anything my mom and i read about i tried
7639458 but nothing treated my acne and helped my skin look smoother or healthier like ansr did i am honestly a new person
7639459 like most acne sufferers before i found ansr i was desperate to try anything that would clear up my skin
7639460 unfortunately medications like accutane come with the risk of severe side effects i love how ansr not only treated my acne but for the first time my skin is clear smooth and glowing

7639465 listening to old dudes talk about german beer the war and trains
7639466 ive been working with jimmy and john paul and trying to do some new material and some writing i dont know what it will be but it will be something at the moment all i know is i have the great pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and start work on some material when i get there i never ask any questions if i get a phone call to go and play i enjoy every moment of it whatever it ends up as to ever get a chance to jam with two people like that it is a phenomenal thing for me its my life its what ive dreamed about doing
7639467 possibility of doing something is in the cards i really felt it was in the cards from the moment we walked offstage at the o2

7639474 the illegals stated that they crossed east of the naco port of entry on foot and then were picked up by a u s citizen
7639475 its going to weigh the vehicle down especially when you can see only one occupant in the vehicle
7639476 i think weve all been in a situation where weve been on the opposite end of that where maybe youre trying to get some rest or your familys trying to get some rest and youre disturbed by that party then i think it kind of brings the whole thing into a little bit more perspective
7639477 in tempe the city ordinance indicates that a gathering of five or more people that is disruptive could be considered a party people sometimes say hey its only eight oclock at night or its only 10 oclock at night time is really irrelevant if somebody calls and says my peace is being disturbed thats something were going to look into
7639478 i dont think a lot of of people fundamentally are opposed to people having a good time and having a few friends over but when it gets later in the morning and you have people outside yelling and litter thats when it becomes a neighborhood issue

7639732 i felt good its a game we should have won
7639733 it seemed like months since wed had a four run lead
7639734 when you look at all the injuries and adversity weve had to put up with it might have caught up with us
7639735 the audience for live online simulcast of shows is probably very small compared to on demand viewing
7639736 theyre playing their tails off theyll be right back in the thick of things next year
7639737 im not trying to think too much i didnt have any pressure its the same old thing
7639738 all of these wins at this time of the year seem to really get magnified so hopefully that can kind of spur us on
7639739 i wish i would have had about 15 more minutes to sit out there with my team instead of come out here as quickly as i did
7639740 i think hes definitely capable of pitching like he did tonight
7639741 fortunately hes got good enough stuff to not let them score any runs which is pretty amazing because it seemed like there was people on base all over the place
7639742 if we won the game it would mean a lot more
7639743 but right now were in a pennant race and were going to need more than just a hundred rbis im going to need to keep driving in runs and helping us win ballgames
7639744 i come prepared everyday thats all i have in mind
7639745 i dont prepare myself to be a backup either i wake up at the same time and i eat at the same time as well i prepare for the game the same way
7639746 were playing good baseball but again we just have to keep going cant sit
7639747 both sides left a lot of guys on base a lot of hits we just couldnt come up with the big one
7639748 we have played for a long period of time good baseball
7639749 right now is not the time to not be executing pitches its just not the time but we are in a good spot
7639750 thats one thing that long grueling schedule will bring to light youve got to use everybody
7639751 the three run homer couldnt have come at a better time
7639752 it was a well played game we got down battled back and we had a big inning thanks to bengie
7639753 it doesnt matter if i win six games or 20 games or whatever
7639754 if were having success as a team thats the biggest thing its just having wins it doesnt matter who gets them or how you get them it just depends on if we do get them and we just need to keep on doing that
7639755 i just didnt have it i couldnt throw the ball where i wanted to throw it i just didnt make pitches thats all there is to it
7639756 i face them again in five days and hopefully ill be able to make the adjustment and go out there and have a better game plan against them
7639757 we have run out of gas and are selling it only to company cars this is all the information i have at this point
7639758 the war is in georgia but its armenia that is in crisis
7639759 they keep saying that petrol is coming and there are no problems but there is a problem
7639760 even in the most remote georgian village there is no petrol shortage
7639761 why because there are many petrol importers in georgia but only three of them in this country
7639762 the georgian railway has begun functioning at a fraction of its capacity
7639763 but even that is enough if there is any deficit i think it will be eliminated shortly
7639764 in all likelihood 35 cars loaded with wheat will head to armenia today
7639765 besides we have a lot of freight in the ports of poti and batumi awaiting shipment
7639766 in particular in poti there are two ships carrying 6 700 tons of wheat and 93 rails cars of other goods in batumi we have 2 500 tons of wheat ten cars of petrol and another one thousand tons of petrol
7639767 as usual we were sweeping the avenue in the morning when we saw policemen grouping here and there
7639768 we were told that the walls in northern avenue belong to the state and we have no right to touch them does it mean that the country is owned by kocharian and sarkissian dont ordinary citizens have anything in this city they even tore my documents medicine and books put on the table
7639769 if we are not armenias citizens do away with us and live with those who are ready to serve you
7639770 top ranked policeman valeri osipian announced several times he would kill me who is to defend me who has empowered them to violate my constitutional right in no other country is a citizen so humiliated and disgraced
7639771 i was trying to save miasnik malkhassians poster i was pushed and dropped then they threw the poster at me and began hitting me on the head
7639772 how long can they govern a country with torture and beating the whole world witnesses their brutality
7639773 when we protested they began shouting and verbally abusing us
7639774 the regime is terrified by the growing effectiveness and appeal of the ongoing sit in in northern avenue
7639775 we still want to go out there and win every game theres no one here who doesnt care if we win or lose
7639776 i would love to get that record im not going to lie to you
7639777 its not all about me its about the ballclub and winning ballgames
7639778 winning two out of four its not a bad series
7639779 americans recognize that neither john mccain nor barack obama are agents of change in this country

7639864 peace peace just peace and immediately stop the military operation in waziristan swat and bajur areas
7639865 we have been forced to take this decision which we take with great regret
7639866 zardari pledged in writing to reinstate the judges within one day of musharraf leaving
7639867 i believe he is the most suitable candidate he is the one who refused to take an oath under musharrafs rule
7639868 this is a great pakistani his service to this country is unmatched
7639869 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself
7639870 altogether this furthers our thesis that its highly unlikely that apple is going to wave a magic wand and say 3g problems be gone with a software update
7639871 i think people are used to seeing me as the director of homeland security and emergency mangement
7639872 if he wanted to make a public service announcement he wouldnt be paying for it with campaign funds
7639873 he wouldnt be putting in his photo and saying harris county judge
7639874 it was kanyes 1st beat since the passing of his mom
7639875 it was kanyes 1st beat since the passing of his mom
7639876 the judges should have been reinstated on aug 19 the day after musharrafs resignation
7639877 now it is being said that agreements are not binding like the quran
7639878 nawaz sharif has been too inflexible on the judges issue
7639879 where mr sharif proved that his politics had no room for flexibility mr zardari showed to the world that his definition of ethics in politics was somewhat different from that held by most others
7639880 we made a mistake by signing an agreement to restore the judges
7639881 once you make a mistake the problem is that you keep repeating it
7639882 zardari is more ruthless and more cunning it was a display of realpolitik he doesnt give a damn about agreements he wants to consolidate his government he will lose popularity but popularity matters six months before an election not six months after it
7639883 our time has now come zardari will be our president
7639884 from the american point of view that would be a plus there will be one man sitting in the presidency who can handle all the decisions
7639885 the americans are concerned about sharifs closeness to religious parties
7639886 sharif represents a very important constituency and his support would have been helpful by isolating him there is a risk of isolating his base
7639887 most people in this country i dont think will be happy with it given mr zardaris reputation
7639888 we will not easily arrest people if they dont break any law
7639889 the persecution of religious believers is very much alive in china and ongoing regardless of the fact that the olympics games has just been held in china
7639890 it may take a while were not the fall in line party
7639891 to come out energized excited and ready to elect barack obama
7639892 i ask each and every one of you to work as hard for barack and running mate sen joe biden d del as you worked for me
7639893 despite our feelings that maybe it could have been different we know we have a task at hand
7639894 there is actually an agreement concluded between the two parties over the definite date which is 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7639895 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7639896 unless these articles are changed it will be hard for this agreement to pass
7639897 for discussion with these key partners on issues if mutual interest
7639898 i think the message hell be bringing the president wanted the vice president to visit the region to consult with leaders in this obviously this strategically important region
7639899 developments lately in georgia have increased the importance of this visit
7639900 i think the russian government understands the limited capabilities of this system
7639901 we have had unprecedented discussions that have explained the technical capabilities of the system i think on the face of it they understand 10 interceptors in poland would have no impact on the russians strategic offensive forces
7639902 the patriot battery in question will be a u s army patriot battery so that it will be owned and operated by the united states army
7639903 what we have said to the russians is that this is not a system which is aimed at russia but rather is aimed at the growing threats we see from places like the middle east

7639916 and now i am happy to come back here and we will see
7639917 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7639918 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7639919 it seems to be a common technique of his doesnt it cordingley said of the incidents involving the boks tighthead
7639920 ive only seen the footage once during the game i couldnt really remember much when he contacted me i sort of thought well hes hit me with the head but i thought the attempt might have been legitimate
7639921 it sort of glanced off me it wasnt the full impact
7639922 the first time he went at me i could see him coming at me and the second time i sort of backed away after referee lyndon bray told me to release the ball from the ruck and luckily for me i did because it sort of just glanced me but i wouldnt have liked to cop the full brunt
7639923 id have to say its probably the most enjoyable test that ive been involved in he said
7639924 i suppose looking back i wasnt expecting to be a part of this squad and to get a start against the springboks such a proud nation at probably what is my favourite stadium to play at at kings park absa stadium it was just a real honour and wins are at a premium over here
7639925 its fine its not a problem at all he said
7639926 i have to manage it pretty well these days given my age
7639927 i do have to stay pretty warm when the guys start calling you things like tin man then it becomes a bit of an issue so its a constant reminder that i have to keep myself ready to play test football
7639928 as a black man barack can get shot just walking to the gas station

7639957 bromiket throws another blade and misses all skellies move around you and start to attack the first one misses you the second one hits your shield like that i hit my empty coke can with the marker to make it resonate the third one hits your armour hard nico does the coke can trick enjoying it immensely but fails to hurt you the last one slips under your armour and hurts you a bit
7639958 no its just a scratch its your turn now you know that now would be a good time to breathe fire
7639959 all 3 skellies caught in your blast are instantly incinerated
7639960 bromiket takes his dagger and hits the last one real hard clatter clatter the dice say it falls to pieces real hard you beat all skellies
7639961 as you celebrate you hear a rumble on top of the pyramid and you see bones jumping and forming a bigger much stronger looking skeleton
