5200000 de modo que hacia abajo fue arrojado el gran drag n la serpiente original el que es llamado diablo y satan s que est extraviando a toda la tierra habitada fue arrojado abajo a la tierra y sus ngeles fueron arrojados abajo con l
5200001 sabemos que nosotros nos originamos de dios pero el mundo entero yace en el poder del inicuo
5200002 para que no seamos alcanzados por satan s porque no estamos en ignorancia de sus designios
5200003 ahora bien las obras de la carne son manifiestas y son fornicaci n inmundicia conducta relajada idolatr a pr ctica de espiritismo enemistades contiendas celos arrebatos de c lera altercaciones divisiones sectas envidias borracheras diversiones estrepitosas y cosas semejantes a estas en cuanto a estas cosas les aviso de antemano de la misma manera como ya les avis que los que practican tales cosas no heredar n el reino de dios
5200004 y aconteci que yendo nosotros al lugar de oraci n nos encontr cierta sirvienta que ten a un esp ritu un demonio de adivinaci n ella proporcionaba mucha ganancia a sus amos practicando el arte de la predicci n esta muchacha segu a detr s de pablo y de nosotros y gritaba usando estas palabras estos hombres son esclavos del dios alt simo los cuales les est n publicando el camino de la salvaci n esto lo sigui haciendo por muchos d as por fin pablo se cans de ello y se volvi y dijo al esp ritu te ordeno en el nombre de jesucristo que salgas de ella y sali en aquella misma hora
5200005 ahora bien samuel mismo hab a muerto y todo israel hab a procedido a pla irlo y a enterrarlo en ram su propia ciudad en cuanto a sa l l hab a quitado del pa s a los m dium espiritistas y a los pronosticadores profesionales de acontecimientos
5200006 mira que t mismo sabes bien lo que sa l hizo c mo cort del pa s a los m dium espiritistas y a los pronosticadores profesionales de acontecimientos por qu pues est s obrando como un entrampador contra mi alma para hacer que se me d muerte
5200007 tan ciertamente como que vive yehowah culpa por error no te sobrevendr en este asunto
5200008 por qu me embaucaste cuando t mismo eres sa l
5200009 a un dios vi que sub a de la tierra
5200010 es un viejo que sube y est cubierto con una vestidura sin mangas
5200011 por qu me has perturbado y has hecho que me hagan subir
5200012 estoy en grave aprieto puesto que los filisteos est n peleando contra m y dios mismo se ha apartado de m y no me ha contestado m s ni por medio de los profetas ni por sue os de modo que te llamo para que me hagas saber lo que he de hacer
5200013 por qu pues inquieres de m cuando yehowah mismo se ha apartado de ti y resulta ser tu adversario y yehowah har para s tal como habl por medio de m y yehowah arrancar de tu mano el reino y lo dar a tu semejante david como no obedeciste la voz de yehowah y no ejecutaste su ardiente c lera contra amaleq por eso esta es la cosa que yehowah ciertamente te har en el d a actual y yehowah tambi n dar a israel juntamente contigo en la mano de los filisteos y ma ana t y tus hijos estar n conmigo hasta el campamento de israel dar yehowah en la mano de los filisteos
5200014 los muertos mismos no alaban a yah ni lo hace ninguno que baja al silencio
5200015 no deber a hallarse en ti nadie que haga pasar por el fuego a su hijo o a su hija nadie que emplee adivinaci n practicante de magia ni nadie que busque ag eros ni hechicero ni uno que ate a otros con maleficio ni nadie que consulte a un m dium espiritista o a un pronosticador profesional de sucesos ni nadie que pregunte a los muertos
5200016 y en caso de que les digan recurran a los m dium espiritistas o a los que tienen esp ritu de predicci n que est n chirriando y profiriendo expresiones en voz baja no es a su dios a quien debe recurrir cualquier pueblo debe recurrirse a personas muertas en pro de personas vivas
5200017 a causa de esto al grense cielos y los que residen en ellos ay de la tierra y del mar porque el diablo ha descendido a ustedes teniendo gran c lera sabiendo que tiene un corto espacio de tiempo y el drag n se air contra la mujer y se fue para hacer guerra contra los restantes de la descendencia de ella los cuales observan los mandamientos de dios y tienen la obra de dar testimonio de jes s
5200018 buen n mero de los que hab an practicado artes m gicas juntaron sus libros y los quemaron delante de todos
5200019 no pueden estar bebiendo la copa de yehowah y la copa de demonios no pueden estar participando de la mesa de yehowah y de la mesa de demonios
5200020 sobre todo les dijo pablo tomen el escudo grande de la fe con el cual podr n apagar todos los proyectiles encendidos del inicuo
5200021 qui n es el que vence al mundo sino el que tiene fe en que jes s es el hijo de dios
5200022 con toda forma de oraci n y ruego oren en toda ocasi n en esp ritu
5200023 ejecutar el deseo de los que le temen y oir su clamor por ayuda y los salvar
5200024 suj tense por lo tanto a dios pero op nganse al diablo y l huir de ustedes ac rquense a dios y l se acercar a ustedes l mpiense las manos pecadores y purifiquen su coraz n indecisos
5200025 y a los ngeles que no guardaron su posici n original sino que abandonaron su propio y debido lugar de habitaci n los ha reservado con cadenas sempiternas bajo densa oscuridad para el juicio del gran d a
5200026 cuando el ministro del hombre del dios verdadero madrug para levantarse y sali afuera pues all estaba una fuerza militar que cercaba a la ciudad con caballos y carros de guerra en seguida su servidor le dijo ay amo m o qu haremos pero l dijo no tengas miedo porque hay m s que est n con nosotros que los que est n con ellos y eliseo se puso a orar y decir oh yehowah brele los ojos por favor para que vea inmediatamente yehowah abri los ojos al servidor de manera que l vio y mire la regi n monta osa estaba llena de caballos y carros de guerra de fuego todo en derredor de eliseo
5200027 y esto es lo que el amor significa que sigamos andando seg n sus mandamientos este es el mandamiento as como han o do ustedes desde el principio que deben seguir andando en l porque muchos enga adores han salido al mundo personas que no confiesan a jesucristo como venido en carne este es el enga ador y el anticristo
5200028 yehowah sabe librar de la prueba a personas de devoci n piadosa pero reservar a personas injustas para el d a del juicio para que sean cortadas de la existencia
5200029 el n mero de ellos era mir adas de mir adas
5200030 mi propio dios envi a su ngel y cerr la boca de los leones

5200220 the scene was very tragic the aircraft had come down in the woods there was a clearing where it crashed through
5200221 it was upside down and the top of the roof was crushed one of the engines was some distance away
5200222 it was really very difficult to get into the aircraft we were having to rip off the skin with our hands
5200223 the twin engined aircraft was on quite a low approach to coventry on the normal land path when a smaller aircraft came from the right and the twin engined aircraft struck it side on
5200224 the smaller plane disintegrated immediately and the right engine of the twin aircraft blew up
5200225 whilst we watched the twin engined aircraft bank steeply to the left with smoke coming from its right engine it seemed to level off and climb slightly before dropping steeply down to the left
5200226 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50 feet up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane
5200227 it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees
5200228 but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods
5200229 it was weird because there was no bang i couldnt believe what i had seen
5200230 two of them were not only commercial pilots but they were also fully qualified instructors they had many many thousands of hours of flying time between them
5200231 it is an absolute tragedy for us because we are a small company we are like a family we know everyone extremely well our thoughts and prayers are with the families
5200232 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5200233 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft
5200234 it was a very very routine piece of work and the plane was about to land in a normal routine fashion

5200255 irans diplomatic efforts have achieved some results which partly dispelled pressures from the united states

5200302 i saw them on tv they are very cute i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breastfeed them i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5200303 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession the babies are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5200304 what they need most is a dwelling to live in
5200305 i hope the government will give them an apartment with the help of allah they will make it but i think that it will be difficult
5200306 you have to hear the responses inside the shin bet to the release they work day and night to capture and neutralize terrorists and all of it is gone in an instant
5200307 people in the shin bet end up asking why do we capture these people
5200308 a terrorist who plants an explosive device gets 10 years in prison but will end up being released after three or four years this hurts the motivation in the shin bet
5200309 the government realized it could not do a southern hostage deal so it went with the northern hostage deal to reduce public pressure on it
5200310 hamas is demanding 450 heavyweight prisoners who took part in recent terrorist attacks the memories of the victims families are still very raw i dont believe the government can go ahead with this
5200311 on the morning after the release we heard fatah blaming israel whatever happens they will blame israel and fault everyone except for themselves
5200312 the aim of the release is also to show the americans and europeans that we are open minded and that we are helping out the side that we are supposed to be helping
5200313 in the short term this is not a risk the aksa martyrs brigades have been neutralized by the pa for the time being
5200314 but what many in israel do not realize is that while these terrorists may not go back to fighting many will go back to indoctrinating others into terrorism and creating a terror supporting environment
5200315 some will recruit on campuses others will become so called journalists while others will be integrated into institutions or sent abroad these jobs are meant to compensate them for the alleged suffering they underwent in prisons in israel

5200321 the accused didnt agree to the alternative proposal and he threatened to shoot the woman
5200322 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

5200344 it was more of a market positioning move rather than anything fundamental
5200345 its a general sense the us rally has gone far enough
5200346 towards the end of last week buying of the us dollar and selling of the aussie there was a one way direction in the market
5200347 the market has gone too pessimistic on its outlook for the australian economy
5200348 unfortunately some elements acting for vested interests levelled false allegations against me and deceived people
5200349 they said that during the last nine years our economic problems and electricity shortages were due to our policies it is absolutely wrong and deception for the country
5200350 they never realised that they could be successful against me but they never thought how detrimental it would be for the country
5200351 they are one of the biggest packs in the world and that in itself is a challenge
5200352 theres cj van der linde and i think the beast tendai mtawarira will be playing so thats going to be a big battle for us and how we can step up and improve
5200353 being consistent in our set pieces and making sure we get that right but also just bringing the aggression up right from the start
5200354 they are passionate at home and theyve got passionate supporters so if we get on top of them early then that will set us up for a good game
5200355 my first test was at ellis park in johannesburg in 2006 it was a huge shock it was a bit of a wake up call for me
5200356 i was playing club rugby about three weeks beforehand and then i was in front of 70 000 screaming south africans at altitude
5200357 for a front rower your scrummaging is your number one focus so ive been working really hard on that with wallabies set piece coach michael foley
5200358 thats been my goal just keep my scrummaging going and if anything else comes for me its an added bonus
5200359 technically the all blacks are probably the best scrummaging team in the world at the moment the springboks are right up there
5200360 when you think about the theft of that particular object alone that in fact has very substantially added to the theft of motor vehicle category within our crime figures
5200361 its a modern thing people are nicking them and theyre selling them just like videos were some years ago mr cameron said
5200362 the key message to people is just dont leave the gps in the car
5200363 what we have been arguing for a number of years is to put on a more visible saturation frontline police presence
5200364 it will reduce crime the road toll and anti social behaviour
5200365 if one looks at the treaty between australia and hungary zentai cannot be extradited in relation to the offence which is put against him
5200366 it is not necessary that the offences in hungary and australia be identical
5200367 were hopeful were just hopeful that the australian legal system will look after my father
5200368 they merely duplicated information that was already known at great cost with little benefit
5200369 there needs to be better funding of existing services and funding of new services after appropriate consultation with both communities and experts
5200370 measures which are not evidence based need to be stopped
5200371 unless you address the social determinants of health nothing will change
5200372 this includes for example education housing nutrition and cultural wellbeing
5200373 there has been huge squandering of money with this intervention which could have been better spent
5200374 we need long term commitment to the social determinants of health based on culturally safe community consultation
5200375 the lack of consultation with both health professionals and aboriginal communities
5200376 the injury didnt do me any favours i had about a month off
5200377 its all been about finding my feet again and i felt the few weeks before the st george game i was doing that
5200378 its also been about getting a combination with locky lockyer
5200379 its been a bit of a different situation with locky back and us trying to work on our combination
5200380 when he lockyer wasnt there i just had to do it but now i have to pick my times and work in with him
5200381 theyre key positions too hodgo is a big strike weapon for us and we missed ks hunt creativity around the ruck and his combination with locky

5200385 we are going to help rebuild georgia into a strong georgian state
5200386 the russians will have failed in their effort to undermine georgia and we will be looking at what we can do with the states around that region as well
5200387 there is a ceasefire and russia is currently not in compliance with this ceasefire
5200388 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5200389 had the aussie remained around 98 cents the national average price would have fallen by a further 14 cents to around 1 35 a litre
5200390 motorists have every right to ask where did the extra few cents go
5200391 its not as if its a theory this has actually been operating in the state of western australia for some time where it has brought considerable benefits to motorists in that state
5200392 we are not debating something thats some theoretical debate it has actually happened in practice
5200393 but at the moment mr xenophon appears to be wandering all over the place
5200394 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5200395 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5200396 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5200397 has itself used not just disportionate force but force against civilian targets and the civilian population especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999

5200406 ice skating is a cultural phenomenon in russia its just something that everyone does there
5200407 that was a deliberate thought that both sergey ryshkoff and debra brown had to keep the show as natural as possible in terms of the costuming and the make up
5200408 they wanted the beauty of these people to come through and not look artificial
5200409 they performed in 15 000 seat arenas down to surfaces half the size of what we have now
5200410 so the pressure on them is to adjust on the size
5200411 brown felt that it was a very romantic piece visually and styled it in terms of choreography lighting and music
5200412 the interesting thing is how well they recover and stay within their routine
5200413 it was a collaborative effort between the producer and director debra brown
5200414 they literally went through hundreds and hundreds of different tracks to find the right music that conveyed not only what was going on stage physically but emotionally as well

5200422 we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
5200423 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
5200424 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
5200425 many people still assume that parenting ends when a child turns 18 but in our culture today there is a longer extension of adolescence
5200426 im not a fan about audience recordings but the source that was offered here by vortex242 was pretty good this concert was the first time that i saw tom waits live on stage so i had a good reason to remastered this i was amazed about the conclusion its not perfect and of course not a sbd quality but maybe the best quality that we can get from the actually tw tour until now i think the sound quality is good enougt to line up in the other tw remaster as vol 9 thanks vortex again for sharing this exellent recording
5200427 if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends and it means that those sins that i have on a fairly regular basis hopefully will be washed away
5200428 and it means that those sins that i have on a fairly regular basis hopefully will be washed away
5200429 you promise to all who trust you forgiveness of sins and fullness of grace courage in the struggle for justice and peace your presence in trial and rejoicing and eternal life in your realm which has no end
5200430 but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but through deeds
5200431 well that didnt quite work out the way i think it should have but maybe i can get a little bit better
5200432 there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and so i think anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention
5200433 if you believe that life begins at conception then and you are consistent on that belief then i cant argue with you on that because that is a core issue of faith for you
5200434 are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5200435 as a christian it is also a sacred union gods in the mix
5200436 a man killed in a shooting at an east london pub was an innocent bystander police have said
5200437 locking up a journalist for covering election campaign like our colleague mohammed mohamud is legally baseless and is part of widespread campaign to restrict publics right to information
5200438 the employer has been put on notice step out of line again and litigation is very much on the table he said
5200439 ignorance will not be an acceptable excuse second time around
5200440 the canadian content stuff is frequently at the top of the titles available
5200441 as these are men who desperately want to be in adult movies themselves specifically real productions adult movies they will be very interested in watching a network featuring these movies
5200442 suddenly the sky was humming all four million wasps were coming they smelled the jam they dived and struck and they ate so much that they all got stuck
5200443 publication of false news with intent to cause fear and alarm to the gambian public
5200444 macharia and madhupaper were represented by some of the most able and prominent counsel in the country
5200445 i would never vote to tear these buildings down it will probably be cheaper to refurbish them than tear them down and start all over
5200446 they county leaders have great connections because of everything they have brought to the highlands i think working with them will really help us bring in some development for these buildings
5200447 its a very serious issue for households its a very serious issue for business and its a very serious issue for our national economy
5200448 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur absolutely no excuse
5200449 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5200450 in recent times the cost of borrowing money short term has come down and that is a considerable benefit to the banks
5200451 what ive said is that we are always looking at the extent of competition within the mortgage market and if the banks dont move ive said the treasury are examining a range of options and all options are on the table
5200452 in an effort to offer as many advanced placement classes as we can in high school one teacher at one high school can teach it to other students in real time with interaction through a computer
5200453 students can take their advanced classes via the computer and participate in video conferences
5200454 for instance if there is a shortage in spanish if we need that we can do that in addition to advanced placement classes online
5200455 our staff each year does a tremendous job they use a lot of their initiative and are a very dedicated and talented staff we have a tradition of producing excellent scores on tests and we want to exceed in 21st century skills so our students are successful in a global world
5200456 the sixth graders will be going to moundsville middle school which is no longer a junior high and the sixth graders from sherrard will go to sherrard middle school which is new
5200457 four new rooms have been added to the moundsville middle school in order to hold the influx of students both of those facilities were in our bond package
5200458 we relocated the horticultural program and remodeled classroom space for technology
5200459 we intend to offer more dual credit opportunities for our students from west virginia northern community college and will also be open for adult learning opportunities for example someone at the coal mine who wants to work their way up in ranks to management will have the opportunity to take classes at john marshall high school as if they were at west virginia northern community college
5200460 we have a principals academy to provide them additional training and time to meet together to review procedures and polices
5200461 our excess levy expires at the end of this school year so the board will be setting the levy date in august
5200462 that will be critical to our county system the voters of brooke county have always supported the schools it will be very critical for us to pass our excess levy its our local operating money we do get state money but our county depends on operating money to provide free text books and to try to keep up to date with technologies supplies and instructional materials for students
5200463 we have done over the course of the summer a lot of building maintenance across the county as we usually do with upgrading and improving
5200464 we take pride in preparing not just in july and august its an ongoing process to keep the direction of the curriculum up to date we are excited and anticipating another great year for ohio county
5200465 we are hoping within the week the lights and security bollards will be set it will add something very significant to the front of the building both appearance wise and security wise all of our buses are also ready to go clean and inspected the custodians worked hard over the summer and the buildings look fantastic the students are pretty much ready to come back and we are definitely ready to have them back
5200466 more and more information is but a keystroke away for the modern student
5200467 knowing how to access that information is a key to a competitive education for that reason tyler county schools continues to focus on technology education in all areas of the curriculum and at all levels elementary middle and high school
5200468 the big miners were playing catch up from lower commodity prices over the weekend but weve seen oil tick up on a weakening us dollar and theres a potential storm brewing over the gulf of mexico
5200469 golds recovered to back over us800 00 an ounce and people are jockeying for position along with the bhp result which is coming out as we speak
5200470 we cannot release any further details about the motorcycle crash at this time
5200471 once we meet with the prosecutor we will release additional details about the case
5200472 its one of my prized possessions but winning the gold medal is not my fondest memory
5200473 my fondest memory from the olympics is actually meeting people the olympic experience i compare that to here i had a blast at the 1998 newfoundland and labrador winter games thats what i remember most
5200474 im still in touch with many of the teams i played the medal is great i usually have it with me and i like showing it but its everything that came with it thats near and dear to me
5200475 i know firsthand just how important sport can be in shaping and influencing your lives
5200476 i truly learned some of my most important skills and made some of my best lifelong friends through sport i can tell you all your lives are greatly enriched by your dedication to your chosen sport or sports
5200477 in these games you the athletes have integrated all that is best in sports fair play dedication hard work team spirit friendships and lets not forget fun
5200478 athletes your performance at the games has been spectacular you have embodied the spirit of the games
5200479 they say the youth are our future well let me say that after watching how you have conducted yourself during these games the future looks very very bright indeed
5200480 you are all to be commended for your winning attitudes both on and off the fields i know that as a result of these games you will be stronger and better than ever
5200481 they came here together ate together slept together and they played a couple of games that were very competitive
5200482 they really did have a great time there was lots of entertainment provided for everybody
5200483 i think they are going to walk away having had a great experience and with many fond memories i know i played back two games ago in the summer and it was my favourite tournament i have played in to date
5200484 its a different atmosphere than a provincials or nationals because you are playing with athletes from all different sports so you get a bit of everything you dont have to necessarily go to the field to watch soccer but you can take in these other sports around
5200485 i made a lot of new friends and i will miss these guys when we go home corner brook is a great place theres great facilities and it is one of my favourite places on the island but i will remember all the time i spent with my friends
5200486 the host committee has been working for over a year to ensure you have enjoyed yourself at these games
5200487 we are a team we worked as a team and i think our team deserves a gold medal for this performance over the last nine days
5200488 i think the people of corner brook are awesome when it comes to what they have done here
5200489 the host team basically committed a year to this and without their efforts interest and talents we couldnt have done it
5200490 once again corner brook has risen to the challenge and demonstrated its ability to host a world class sporting event
5200491 a special thank you to the organizing committee under the leadership of brian bonnell all the staff and nearly 1 100 volunteers from the west coast region who were critical to the success of these fabulous games the spirit of sport felt here throughout the past eight days and the memories that each athlete will take home are the direct result of your time and your energy
5200492 i think it was an opportunity to showcase the city the people of corner brook the facilities we have the hospitality of the region in general and show people that corner brook is truly the second city in this province and we are very proud of it
5200493 we have had rave revues on all of our facilities we have had people come from as far away as st pierre et miquelon just raving about the beauty of the place the flowers the trees and all that kind of stuff
5200494 the athletes coaches and managers were all very pleased with the facilities everybody had a wonderful time for a lot of people it was their first time at an event like this for a lot of the younger kids probably their first time in corner brook so i think weve created 1 700 ambassadors who can go out to the province and say what a wonderful place corner brook is how great the people are and what a wonderful games we can put off here
5200495 we want to see our athletes entering these programs as more and more people become involved in these summer sports four or eight or 12 years down the road become nationally recognized athletes
5200496 we certainly have something here we can build on so i think there is great potential here for all of our sports we have some more work to do on some of the other facilities but i think the building of the wellington street complex itself demonstrates to the citizens that it was money well invested and important to our youth and everyone
5200497 it would have been nice to win it but i though our team fought hard
5200498 for most of our guys this is the first chance theyve had to play fastpitch and at times that showed they got to see some pretty good teams this week and i think if they stick with it we might have a nice little ball team here
5200499 i think if we would have had to play right after we wouldnt have done as good
5200500 we needed a break to forget about it and everything
5200501 we just didnt make the mistakes we did in the semis
5200502 we fixed everything and stuff actually went in and went right for us
5200503 i was there in the 2004 one and it was just different being older and everything it was a lot better because there were more fans and everything here to help you
5200504 it helped because we didnt have to get used to each other at first
5200505 i think we actually could have come away with the gold but im pretty happy with what we did
5200506 the people we played against have been playing together for years and me and tyler just got put together for the first time a couple of weeks ago
5200507 the accommodations were good and you were able to go over to the courts any time you wanted and play after the scheduled games were over for the day just being around everyone all at once like that was fun

5200511 with falls in commodity prices i think the market is relaxed about inflation
5200512 the big miners were playing catch up from lower commodity prices over the weekend but weve seen oil tick up on a weakening us dollar and theres a potential storm brewing over the gulf of mexico
5200513 golds recovered to back over us800 00 an ounce and people are jockeying for position along with the bhp result which is coming out as we speak
5200514 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
5200515 they were both laughing and walked all over the lawn together holding hands and posing the whole afternoon seemed light hearted
5200516 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her weve both changed and grown and we just feel like oh okay this is completion

5200519 in the game against portsmouth last season we had many difficulties too many
5200520 now we have won 4 0 the chelsea fans saw a beautiful game and three points
5200521 we have to keep this going we can every game every week i dont know but well try
5200522 i think the owner roman abramovich is happy like all the fans hes one more fan for chelsea
5200523 the players put on the field what we did with them in training
5200524 but well need more quality in the future if we want to be champions well need more than this
5200525 liu xiang has two injuries one in his foot and one in his leg
5200526 since athens his main goal was to achieve gold in beijing
5200527 todays result was not perfect for all of us and especially liu xiang he has been under great pressure and expectations from all of us
5200528 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
5200529 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5200530 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5200531 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
5200532 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization
5200533 preliminary investigation indicates the kid came shooting out of a bike path onto the road and the driver didnt even know he hit him
5200534 he got out checked out his vehicle then continued driving and the kid was underneath the vehicle
5200535 i went door to door with my snow shovel just like any other kid
5200536 with that flat rate i began making over 3 000 a month at 12 years old and i was able to save that money and buy a snowmobile to do driveways

5200550 based on this smell how much would you like this man as a long term partner
5200551 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
5200552 what brunei can do in the sense of becoming a google is that it can specialise in something and give a brand promise to the market what google promised was im faster so brunei can say something like im cleaner or im more focused because im not doing anything else
5200553 you have to explore the market and identify it with the niche and focus on that and of course you need to do a swot strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats analysis
5200554 it would give brunei the leadership role in providing the knowledge and service in the halal market
5200555 is an idea of an institution that will provide a platform for an ongoing collaborative relationship between ulama scientists and industry specialists to guide and steer the development of the market through some of the more complex issues that have arisen and others which will surely arise in the future
5200556 what they do with it will be entirely up to them
5200557 participation of experts in areas of halal it and halal logistic
5200558 the inforama also showcases how students make full use of ict in school to complete their projects
5200559 this showcase also gives exposure to the public so that they can recognise and appreciate the talents of these individuals and groups
5200560 a lot of people like the auto show it brings all of us together in one place and lets us see each others cars
5200561 we dont really see it as a competition were just here as one in unity just to enjoy ourselves
5200562 its been a while since the last car show and weve been looking forward to this years car show
5200563 at first i was focused on spl but now i focus on sound quality
5200564 i like listening to loud music and i like people to hear what im listening to
5200565 its a good initiative to raise awareness about the importance of protecting and maintaining a clean and healthy environment
5200566 apea 2008 is the most prestigious award for entrepreneurs in asia pacific
5200567 the winners have to undergo a very rigorous nomination and judging process spanning four months and involving over 50 on ground audit and verification officials
5200568 in the current economic climate it is essential that we continue to develop our entrepreneurial talents as a means to distinguish ourselves from global dynamics
5200569 i believe we must embrace and not shy away from the world at large so that we can compete and be amongst the champions out there
5200570 this has shown that our communities are very much concerned and are willing to invest towards the development of oil and gas education in brunei
5200571 trigger creative thinking amongst students to come up with alternatives other than oil and gas such as involvement in forestry tourism agriculture fishing and other renewable resources like wind solar and tidal wave
5200572 the current high oil price has made what was once uneconomic now a lucrative campaign
5200573 i read a few books and articles on the topics presented
5200574 the need for more involvement for our ulama has been noted at several of the halal market conferences around the world and we have taken this fact into consideration here in brunei darussalam
5200575 halal is relatively simple but industry and in particular the food industry has become increasingly complex and it has become progressively clearer that a new kind of discourse is needed to ensure that industrial procedures remain within the parameters of syariah compliance
5200576 we also need to carry out this halal business through training and innovation to find solutions that can be used in the halal chain considering the factor of halal ness and purity from the very beginning for halal products such as the creation of halal fertilisers
5200577 our agenda is to make brunei a first stop for halal industries in areas like environment products as well as services
5200578 we would like to make the brunei halal brand a perfect choice globally
5200579 if you use the concept of science in our detection system we want to create it at an international standard one that is recognised by the world because of our detection and inspection system
5200580 we need more infrastructure the set up of the centre will become a platform to reach the objectives through innovation commercialisation and halallisation
5200581 the world produces 285 000 tonnes of gelatin and 42 per cent of the components that make up the gelatin is from pork as well as from non halal animals
5200582 the brunei government cannot run it when the company does not have international experience
5200583 once the consumers come to brunei which they know is a muslim country and theres no alcohol they build the trust its a matter of trust this initiative the brand the certification
5200584 the bimp eaga corridor has a total population of 50 million and the area is very rich in resources india would certainly like to take advantage of this by becoming a development partner like china did long ago
5200585 this is a new place and will grow rapidly in the coming years besides political stability and social peace also play a big role in attracting foreign investors

5200592 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5200593 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week

5200597 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5200598 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5200599 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5200600 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5200601 it was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward
5200602 our approach is unique in the world no one else has yet developed customized immunotherapy using the virus from individual patients
5200603 this experimental technique remains long and costly for the moment but were hoping it will hold the promise of a completely innovative and widely available treatment in the future
5200604 at this stage we have shown that the technique doesnt cause side effects or an undesirable auto immune response
5200605 health canada has approved a multicentre clinical trial across the country that will let us further assess the techniques effectiveness at controlling hiv reproduction were hoping that the fda in the united states will also give us the go ahead soon so that our pharmaceutical partner argos therapeutics can begin testing in the united states
5200606 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
5200607 they didnt compensate for the lower calorie mushroom meal by eating more food later in the day
5200608 this is shocking we decided to file the rti when we saw parents unable to admit their seriously ill children at aiims while children of some other poor and illiterate families were being kept in the hospital needlessly for a long time
5200609 aiims said in its reply that families of patients are given social counseling before trials are started with most patients in aiims being illiterate and belonging to extremely poor families i doubt if they even understand what a clinical trial is and what their children are being subjected to
5200610 all the deaths cant be attributed to the trials some patients were suffering from conditions in which mortality was the normal outcome and we were trying to see whether a drug could improve the situation some other trials didnt even use medications they involved behavioral methods like nursing care
5200611 trials in aiims are conducted under strict protocol and every step is scrutinized through faculty presentations and data safety management groups before ethical clearances are received

5200655 you shall know this day and understand it in your heart that the almighty is god
5200656 when you stood at mount sinai god asked who will insure that you will always fear god you should have replied almighty you will you should have seized the opportunity to request that god give you fear of heaven
5200657 it is proper for all those who fear god to constantly be in pain and worry over the destruction of the holy temple
5200658 any generation in which the holy temple is not rebuilt is held responsible for its destruction
5200659 if one person does a sincere teshuva return to god then the whole world merits forgiveness

5200668 im just a simple man i am not endowed with any measure of talent or intelligence
5200669 its actually quite complicated first i have to select the proper gauge rope and then i have to weave the net in a particular pattern to ensure that it has the proper balance of strength and flexibility
5200670 that too is quite complex there are many factors involved including season of the year time of day type of fish water depth temperature and speed of the current

5200674 the room had only about 20 people in it yet he was already having a bit of a dance
5200675 he was looking the worse for wear and had obviously been out most of the day again he was never without a beer in his hand
5200676 he had girls round him all the time whether he was going up to them or they were coming over to him
5200677 he seemed happy to talk to anyone and wasnt bothered if people recognised him i even saw him cracking on to a waitress
5200678 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5200679 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5200680 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
5200681 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization

5200688 i would advise these players to not be stubborn and behave sensibly
5200689 the icc and its member boards are satisfied with our security arrangements and foolproof planning and there is no reason for not having the champions trophy in pakistan
5200690 there is no question of the tournament being relocated to some other country or being postponed it will be held in pakistan as scheduled as it is there is no other time available to have this event now

5200721 this protein directly affects photosynthesis and how plants create biomass stems leaves and stalks and oils
5200722 if the plant is storing oil in its leaves there could be more oil per plant which could make production of biofuels such as biodiesel more efficient more research is needed so we can completely understand the mechanism of operation
5200723 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
5200724 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
5200725 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
5200726 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5200727 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5200728 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5200729 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5200730 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviours among asian americans
5200731 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5200732 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5200733 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans
5200734 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led this is tough stuff

5200737 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5200738 team sports like cricket should not be included in the olympics olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself it would be unfair to include cricket in the olympics as the players of other sports especially of individual events wait for the single day to happen and show their talents
5200739 hampers other sports but it is the governments who should take corrective measures to ensure that individual sports also get their due
5200740 olympics is the lifeline the player waits for this day after long four years to showcase his talent and also to let the world know about him

5200748 were going to make substantial profits and the author will be cashing in for sure
5200749 i agree with konzen sugai i think this online gaming economy instructional manual is first rate my colleague blanks lickley may think otherwise but i think we can both agree that this is a quality work that will help de mistify the world of online gaming economy programming architecture
5200750 dont let the criticisms of darosa blasini get in the way of this great online gaming economy resource
5200751 bertie thornberry doesnt quite get it this is a big picture project that is meant to solve macro level problems not address minor programming and design idiosyncracies that pop up when running a live online gaming economy project
5200752 this is going to hit the big time and put the author selena boorman of carper huyard technologies inc on easy street
5200753 the middle chapters of the online gaming economy book are my favorite
5200754 i learned many new things about how to manage large online gaming economy operating structures in the workplace which are key to getting the job done quick and dirty
5200755 im think kitzmiller lebowitzs work will be the new bible of the online gaming economy programming industry finally we have something that explains the core principles in both technical and graphical models that allow us to communicate effectively to our employees and executive management
5200756 were not talking about the saturday night movie theatre crowd were talking about seasoned technology professionals with years of coding and design experience

5200776 the question of kosovo was didactic and inspirational for south ossetia so that they wanted to further strain the relations and define their position which is understandable
5200777 the silence of serbian officials served as a sign of silent support for russias punishment of georgia
5200778 in principle a serbian statement might have irritated moscow but would not have provoked condemnation except unless russia had been insincere when affirming georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty
5200779 maybe the government was too inexperienced to realize that they had an opportunity to prove that their argument was right and that recognition of kosovo as an independent state would destabilize other countries and regions where separatists encouraged by the decision to recognize kosovo would resolutely pursue their ambitions for independence
5200780 they serbian officials also missed the opportunity to point out the inaccuracy of statements by the u s and eu that kosovo was a sui generis case finally they missed the chance to reaffirm their main argument that when international law and the un charter are bypassed the law of the jungle wins
5200781 hypocrisy of bushs statements on the need to preserve georgias sovereignty in the light of his policy towards kosovo
5200782 i am under the impression that this is yet another case of serbias excessive inordinate caution when it comes to upsetting anyone in the eu and risking an extension of the list of conditions serbia has to meet to enter the union
5200783 how can anyone believe that this government is dedicated and determined in its fight for kosovo
5200784 the conflict in the caucusus has shown the dangers of the militaristic approach to problem solving
5200785 serbias approach will be different based on legal grounds and peaceful which means seeking the opinion of the icj
5200786 we are very pleased that you understand this situation well that you did not fall for a propaganda scam that is attempting to present an aggression on the part of the georgian army against its own citizens as a conflict between georgia and russia
5200787 russians will never go to war against georgians just as russians will never go to war against serbs thank you for understanding the whole situation and for expressing your sympathies over this sad situation in your letters and verbal contacts with the russian embassy thank you very much
5200788 in the past ten years georgia has on several occasions gone to war with a people that lives in the territory of that republic and we cannot ignore that fact under the present conditions we see a genocide practically taking place against an ethnic minority
5200789 as redundancies recruitment freezes budget cuts title and office closures and the axing of freelances hit johnston press newsrooms across the uk and ireland the nuj is to stage a co ordinated group wide day of actions to highlight the damage being done to local papers
5200790 a tipping point has been reached and the latest cuts are now threatening the very future of the papers if you continue to deny resources for editorial you inevitably produce worse products and why would businesses advertise in or readers buy such products
5200791 the strategy of cut cut cut in editorial budgets has been shown to be a failure and its time it was reversed shareholders should be fearful for their investments and local communities should fear for the future of their papers
5200792 we wont sit back and allow jobs and quality journalism to be threatened the mood amongst our members is one of determination to actively oppose cuts which damage quality lead to increased workloads threaten the future of the titles and put at risk more jobs

5200827 in the 1999 general election pas rode on the wave of sympathy for anwar and benefited hugely but in 2008 anwar rode on our machinery and membership and won big
5200828 some say he is a great asset while others see him as a liability can we further the interest of pas islam and an islamic state by supporting him or should we walk our own independent path thats the dilemma

5201086 for a front rower your scrummaging is your number one focus so ive been working really hard on that with wallabies set piece coach michael foley
5201087 thats been my goal just keep my scrummaging going and if anything else comes for me its an added bonus
5201088 technically the all blacks are probably the best scrummaging team in the world at the moment the springboks are right up there
5201089 they are a dominant side and a powerful bunch of blokes and they can cause trouble

5201108 the feeling of inferiority is something that takes a lot to get over and well whilst arguing with friends from different origins living among other languages and cultures being accustomed to raising professional and social curiosities and doubts we came to the unanimous and perfectly visual decision to illustrate the phenomenon of transculturation with the image of a bottom penetrated by a phallic symbol from cultures that have dominated or currently dominate the world this is how this visual way of talking about a subject as ancient as the world that we live in arose
5201109 throughout europe and the rest of the world the most conservative political tendencies are re emerging as part of an attempt to provide answers to a complex world through increasingly simple solutions although the crime figures have not experienced a relevant increase we are constantly faced with news of local authorities demanding tougher sanctions and more police officers to what extent can security and fear be transmitted at the same time the claudio moyano slope is a perfect place to reflect on this given that as a result of tourism it is one of the safest places in madrid they seek to generate a sensation of a maximum security response against an unknown threat by installing a fake military check point with signs warning people to be on the alert

5201149 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
5201150 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
5201151 a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the united states given its size and diversity
5201152 the fed financed takeover of investment bank bear stearns also made government backing of fannie and freddie debt

5201154 the problem is not quants per se but funds of funds and short term performance focus
5201155 capital is being allocated by nearly incompetent self righteous folks and thats where the problem is hiring of competent managers for our mutual and pension funds should be given a priority
5201156 quantitative portfolio construction based on sound macro value ideas and risk management is here to stay kill short term profit focus kill calendar performance boogies and quants will again become liquidity providers smoothing instead of exaggerating volatility kill the system that allowed quants to get so big dont shoot the quants they are the messengers of a broken system of values we just dont like the message they brought to us

5201185 our biggest challenges are the lack of safe water compounded by low latrine coverages in the villages and return sites
5201186 i am happy to talk to the wife of the president of uganda she asked me what i had on my stall and i told her that i had dolls and crafts
5201187 it is a historical event for mrs museveni to visit the school and especially for talking to me when she visited the pupils stall
5201188 the academy will enable us to achieve our 2020 vision of getting a pga champion
5201189 our cooperation with r amp a is deepening and i am optimistic they will support this development programme
5201190 there is no one appointed to these posts except for one visiting professor who was working on temporary terms
5201191 indeed no one had the basic requirements for either post amongst those that were validated
5201192 university hardly has personnel to offer the necessary academic leadership in the university
5201193 we met as a board to consider our pullout from the icc world twenty20 we have been given instructions by our board to clarify certain issues with the icc
5201194 i will work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
5201195 if virginia was the same state as it was four years ago or eight years ago there wouldnt be much discussion about virginia being a swing state
5201196 i came to be part of the crowd to show local virginia politicians that we are here and want to be taken seriously for the issues that affect us
5201197 my experience with these folks is that their concerns are just about the same as those of other people
5201198 this year there is a high likelihood a small number of voters in northern virginia will elect the next president
5201199 given that scenario i think 71 000 voters is a substantial bloc that could swing things in one direction or the other
5201200 these people they may look a little different they may talk a little different but they want a better america and they have the same concerns as other americans
5201201 we really want to stand up for people who are going to support the community
5201202 it is envisaged that customers will ultimately benefit from cost effective and innovative internet telephony service these recommendations will put indian telecom sector in tune with global trends the grey market tendencies shall be curtailed

5201204 someone in gainesville who was active in the community called me and said what would you think about prince william naming a school after sam
5201205 and i said well i think thats a great honor but there must be other people who lived here longer or people who were born and reared here instead of my husband
5201206 im coming to the ribbon cutting out of great respect for vice admiral gravely and his widow mrs alma gravely the admiral was a role model whom i admired from afar i met him on a few occasions after he retired he was a striking figure who commanded respect with his towering character and intellect yet he was very humble he opened the door and inspired a generation of african american flag officers many are on active duty today
5201207 i dont think navy people go through that many school ribbon cuttings
5201208 this is a very significant event from the navy standpoint
5201209 there were people who didnt want to be on a ship with him there werent many blacks in the navy
5201210 one time he was taken to jail in key west florida for impersonating an officer he was an officer and he was in an officers uniform
5201211 america after eight years of the bush administration is ready for excellence
5201212 i dont have any illusions about it i dont think thats likely to happen
5201213 right now were spending more effort on figuring out how to rebuild iraqs infrastructure than building our own infrastructure
5201214 it was good to hear what he wants to do about infrastructure
5201215 we cant continue to afford this we need a change
5201216 i thought heres a way to help them find out where their foods are coming from
5201217 its also a stalled undertaking and its a secret undertaking this hasnt been a process so far that we can have a lot of confidence in
5201218 nothing like this has ever been done and we have to really be careful because were dealing with peoples lives were dealing with peoples privacy
5201219 even though curtis is not here to witness that i think for his familys sake to know because they always believed in him
5201220 i was convinced 33 years ago that he was innocent
5201221 the dna analysis has led us to a new suspect but this does not exonerate moore
5201222 this was the one holding her down or holding a gun to her head while the other two had their way
5201223 theres a huge demand in this area just from what you would think of as the traditional college student
5201224 then theres also a very big demand for graduate and undergraduate studies for people who are coming back to school
5201225 until we have a firm understanding and agreement to the scope of the study and its cost
5201226 now is the time to show the commitment to this initiative by saying yes these partners will help fund the initiative
5201227 we have rotating exhibits and displays in the community but that still doesnt tap at some of the wonderful things we have in our collection
5201228 for example we have this handcrafted pipe organ that was played at the local hardware store in the early 1950s it may sound strange to have organ music at a hardware store but it was the thing to do someone would go buy nails and be serenaded by the stores owner
5201229 ive always been a supporter of the museum but i think the majority of the council was looking at the economic situation
5201230 the council wants to see the museum grow but we have limited resources and its difficult to find extra money for a large city donation
5201231 we want to be able to exhibit more and tell some of the stories more in depth
5201232 many objects we have are borrowed and have never been exhibited before and we are still getting stuff today
5201233 we have the potential for numerous displays but are missing the space
5201234 we also cant take advantage of traveling exhibitions that many folks would be interested in because we have no place to put them
5201235 the more objects we get out there the more history we can tell
5201236 our stories are not as strong as they could be because we cant put all our objects out

5201244 dealing with infertility is draining from a mental physical and emotional standpoint
5201245 by providing five simple ways that men and women can determine and enhance their own fertility levels i hope to give them back a sense of power over the process
5201246 at 35 and above we know that pregnancy rates go down
5201247 so we dont want people to wait too long because we really would like to do an evaluation to make sure there are no issues that are going on
5201248 we have a live birth rate with a donor egg of 70
5201249 the basal body temperature will typically dip in mid cycle then spike and remain higher until menstruation
5201250 what we often do to assess that is the hysterosalpingogram hsg its an x ray dye test that tells us if the tubes are open and if the uterine cavity is normal in shape
5201251 we know sperm lasts in the cavity a couple of days so by doing that theyve covered the time that theyre most likely ovulating
5201252 next thing you know i was on a quest for something i could really believe in i traveled to places like bhutan ecuador and my local starbucks looking for answers would i embrace buddhism new age pseudo science was i a freak for feeling the way i did or were there other people out there just like me i was grappling with serious questions but somehow a lot of the things that were happening to me seemed well funny

5201257 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5201258 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5201259 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5201260 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5201261 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5201262 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5201263 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5201264 according to the public policy institute of california immigrant latinas in california in 2005 were having babies at the rate of 3 7 per lifetime compared to only 2 4 for mexican women back home in mexico unmistakable conclusion mexicans are sneaking into america to have more children than could afford to have in their own country

5201299 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5201300 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5201301 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5201302 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5201303 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5201304 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5201305 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5201306 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars
5201307 muy bien he recuperado mi felicidad y me siento con mucho entusiasmo para seguir adelante
5201308 s hay que tragar sapos pero s lo por una buena raz n no por nada a cambio
5201309 no podr a ni tendr a que responder esta pregunta lo que hago con la maestra elba esther son acuerdos para la educaci n
5201310 en esta secretar a solamente cumplir con los acuerdos a quienes les debemos son a los ni os a los estudiantes
5201311 mientras se respeten las reglas institucionales y tengamos claros los prop sitos tenemos que considerar acuerdos transparentes
5201312 mis maestros me dieron muy buenas calificaciones en el colegio y m s en disciplina
5201313 estamos ante un reto desafiante es la primera vez en la agenda educativa nacional y lo m s importante es que si el m rito regresa a las aulas cambiar n miles de desempe os en el pa s
5201314 nosotros estamos obligados a seguir adelante es empezar a enfrentar realidades
5201315 claro no tengo duda es una mujer pol tica audaz y cuando da su palabra por lo menos en mi caso hasta ahora la ha cumplido
5201316 no es cuesti n de aprendizaje con ella he construido acuerdos para sumar y lo que quiero es multiplicar para la calidad de la educaci n
5201317 no s si en otras instancias habr una agenda adicional pero aqu es solamente por la calidad de la educaci n
5201318 hay que preguntarle a quienes han tenido que pagarla por lo que sabemos cuesta varios miles de pesos en el menor de los casos
5201319 parece ser que as ha sucedido no tengo una evidencia pero no tengo por qu dudar de que cuando hay discrecionalidad y corrupci n no hay l mites
5201320 hoy estamos hablando de cerca de 7 mil plazas pero a lo largo del a o tendremos alrededor de 25 mil
5201321 s mele de a 30 mil promedio por cada una
5201322 a ver si no la definen la secretar a del 10
5201323 lo que estamos haciendo en esta serie de decisiones es transparentar todo y generar la agenda educativa del pa s estoy consciente del desaf o que representa s que se requiere fortaleza
5201324 apenas hemos tenido voluntad de los gobiernos estatales creo que para todos es un aprendizaje y una apuesta que es novedosa inaudita pero todos sabemos que si no la hacemos no estamos cumpliendo con nuestra obligaci n estaremos traicionando en gran medida los sue os de los mexicanos
5201325 hace muchos a os que estoy a prueba en este pa s las mujeres estamos a prueba en pol tica todos los d as
5201326 hasta ahora parece que vamos aprobando esta materia y no tengo ning n inter s en que cambie mi est ndar de calificaci n
5201327 trabajo incansablemente y quiero de verdad construir con todos muchos puentes
5201328 para transformar en buena medida la agenda educativa del pa s
5201329 en infraestructura para cerrar tantas distancias que hay en el pa s transformar la red de la informaci n de los ciudadanos transformar para crear un nimo distinto y mirar a la escuela como una escuela de todos
5201330 seguramente habr muchos que me calificar n yo solamente quiero seguir haciendo mi mejor esfuerzo
5201331 intento operar igual e incluso con mucho m s actores porque la circunstancia del pa s hoy es distinta la agenda educativa debe ser la agenda de la reconstrucci n nacional
5201332 mi estancia en la sedesol fue probablemente el tiempo donde menos se partidiz la pol tica social donde abrimos los padrones donde se dieron las condiciones para superar la pobreza en gran medida tuve una gran responsabilidad en la campa a de felipe calder n y es sabido por todos que pude hablar con todos los gobernadores en la campa a m s pol mica y creo que ellos jam s hubieran aceptado que hubi ramos tenido un manejo electoral de la pol tica
5201333 estamos totalmente comprometidos he pedido ayuda a la pfp a todos los gobiernos estatales al ej rcito nacional queremos un proceso confiable y cre ble para los mexicanos
5201334 yo tengo la apuesta de que tenemos que hacer todo por creer en ella
5201335 no quiero pensar en eso quiero pensar en que los ciudadanos nos acompa en para que sean ellos quienes nos certifiquen y que somos capaces de hacerlo
5201336 no es parte de la alianza sa ser decisi n de cada identidad federativa
5201337 no yo tengo buena ficha seguramente muy aburrida y mi nico prop sito con las drogas es fortalecer una agenda de seguridad en las escuelas cada ni o que rescatemos ser una vida mucho mejor
5201338 es lograr que los ni os mexicanos aprendan mejor las matem ticas las ciencias que vayan a la escuela con alegr a que aprendan a ser respetuosos tolerantes y que aprendan a amar m xico con un amor mucho m s cercano
5201339 de ninguna manera es una gran apuesta y la educaci n p blica es insustituible
5201340 en primera instancia es responsabilidad del estado pero todos tenemos algo importante que hacer con ella
5201341 deber a de servir para tener m s acceso para tomar mejores decisiones y sobre todo para ser m s humano
5201342 noo eso casi todos quieren ser la verdad es que la educaci n tiene que ser una apuesta de libertad
5201343 s que el presidente est haciendo todos los esfuerzos para que m xico vaya por el camino correcto
5201344 se refiere a los caminos de dar certeza con menos crimen con m s prevenci n y con m s apoyo para el ciudadano
5201345 respeto al ex presidente fox le tengo gratitud y respeto las decisiones del partido
5201346 no coincido con muchos de sus posicionamientos pero simple y sencillamente observo como observan muchos panistas
5201347 cada cual tiene que responder el pan tiene una gran tarea que va m s all de la vida personal de cada uno
5201348 todos tenemos que volver a la escuela nadie puede decir que est suficientemente graduado de la escuela
5201349 con el senador beltrones y con todas las fuerzas pol ticas hay que hacer acuerdos con los prop sitos claros de transformar el pa s para la mayor a de los mexicanos
5201350 los acuerdos requieren voluntad calidad y transparencia nadie con miedos puede construir acuerdos
5201351 pues me gustar a encargarle que haga la parte que le corresponde y que colabore para allanar ciertos caminos sobre todo que le d a cada cual la fortaleza que requiere
5201352 la presidencia no es asunto de dios es de los electores la verdad es que estoy tan ocupada en la agenda educativa ya he vivido una campa a la hice con orgullo fue la m s dif cil de la historia y con eso es suficiente
5201353 con esa campa a ha sido suficiente en mi vida
5201354 para una mujer nunca nada ha sido f cil y creo en que m xico todav a falta vencer muchos obst culos porque se reconozcan y particularmente aqu llos que no quisieron aceptarlo

5201589 i have described atonement the central doctrine of christianity as vicious sado masochistic and repellent we should also dismiss it as barking mad but for its ubiquitous familiarity which has dulled our objectivity if god wanted to forgive our sins why not just forgive them

5201598 it was in like 1960 and thomas was covering jackie and the family primarily and she wasnt covering my uncle yet
5201599 and so her editor called her at 3 a m and said you know we just got this news that carolines hamster died and she said you have to call white house press secretary pierre salinger right now and find out if this is true and so thomas didnt even think about it
5201600 she picked up the phone and she called pierre salinger and she said is it true is it true caroline kennedys hamster died and pierre salinger was like helen its 3 oclock in the morning are you insane youre calling me about this stupid hamster and you know she heard about that for a good long time

5201621 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
5201622 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
5201623 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
5201624 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
5201625 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
5201626 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
5201627 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
5201628 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
5201629 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
5201630 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street
5201631 i feel very honoured and can help it get an olympic medal at least a silver and since we are into such capitalism and buying of national pride why go for the second best they should have bought zhang yining over then we would have won our first gold medal in 48 years or ever

5201633 a coalition of aboriginal rights groups around the country will protest on monday at centrelink offices to highlight the ongoing discrimination of welfare quarantining under the nt emergency intervention and expose the detrimental impacts of the quarantine roll out in february the canberra convergence saw over 2000 people gathered from around the country to protest the nt intervention in solidarity with the centrelink events many of the central australian delegates of the convergence who live in prescribed areas under the intervention will meet in alice springs with concerned community members to create a letter to send to kevin rudd and jenny macklin to voice how and why they oppose the intervention legislation
5201634 the aboriginal rights coalition welcomed todays release of the human rights and equal opportunity commissions social justice report into the northern territory intervention into aboriginal communities commissioner tom calmas report provides an independent analysis critically assessing the race based welfare quarantining and the contravening of the racial discrimination act which he claims has been repealed on flawed premises resulting in multiple breaches of international human rights charters that australia is a signatory to the 2007 social justice report provides clear direction to the recently elected labor government on how to distinguish itself from the legacy of the howard government and work with aboriginal communities to effectively address child sexual assault and family violence while maintaining australias human rights obligations
5201635 it was voiced by the oasis panel hosted by tony jones and what i perceived to be the very clear embarrassment of tanya plibersek mp labor gov minister whose government continue to enact the racist nt emergency response legislation introduced by the howard government that an nt style intervention as enacted upon aboriginal peoples would essentially be unworkable and counter productive the intervention into aboriignal peoples lives did not begin in 2007 it begun in 1788 and continues wrapped in fine words and racist legislation to this very day australia must demand an end to racist legislation and apartheid
5201636 the most revealing indicator that the nt intervention was not consistent with human rights principles was the provision at the centre of the legislative machinery used to support the intervention namely suspending the operation of racial discrimination act the nt intervention among other examples such as native title amendments in 1993 show us that the issue of basic human rights should not be left solely in the hands of a particular government or be subject to the exigencies of a particular set of circumstances we need to have a more comprehensive legal net to protect human rights in australia
5201637 world socialist web site journalists susan allan and richard phillips who are reporting from alice springs on the social and political impact of the northern territory intervention were interviewed on
5201638 so the question is this if rudd and his government are committed to
5201639 amy mcquire makes the case for the rights of aboriginal people over the rights of journalists journalists have a lot of power they can beat people blue in black and white without even leaving their computers but with power comes responsibility in my view press freedom can never compromise the rights of aboriginal people the permit system even with a code of conduct which the meaa have now put on the back burner protects aboriginal communities from unscrupulous people and affords them the same basic rights as everyone else the right to determine who comes onto your property and the circumstances under which they come
5201640 an elder from the territorys mutitjulu community says he has been forced to go to sydney to tell people in the city
5201641 the head of the northern territory emergency response says the intervention has made significant progress despite signs that some communities are ignoring rules banning alcohol
5201642 some families are avoiding health checks ordered as part of the intervention into northern territory aboriginal communities for fear of it being discovered that their children have been sexually abused a nt politician says
5201643 the level of formaldehyde that public servants in remote aboriginal communities were exposed to in converted shipping containers that served as their accommodation was unlikely to cause long term health effects according to australias chief medical officer

5201652 there is no evidence to support claims of a child sex trade at a remote mining town in the northern territory police say
5201653 a northern territory tourism body says the federal intervention into aboriginal affairs has given business a boost in darwin and alice springs but tourism top ends tony clementson says the intervention wasnt the only reason for a growth in the market

5201655 health professionals in the northern territory are calling for a new approach to serious ear disease among indigenous children as the first doctors began visiting remote aboriginal communities last year under the commonwealths intervention in the northern territory the very first problem they found was chronic ear disease in children
5201656 the question raised by the nhulunbuy report is not about the merits of the intervention which will continue to be debated or about the attitudes prevailing in indigenous communities the deep profoundly disturbing question is rather about the attitudes of non indigenous australians some of whom are evidently learning anew habits of abuse that characterised the colonial past sexual abuse of children is not of course confined to aboriginal communities it happens in the prosperous middle class suburbs of australias cities too
5201657 the northern territory intervention has led to the installation of 18 new police stations in remote aboriginal communities one of these stations is at elcho island where police and the community are beginning to build a new relationship

5201660 the tapa sexo sex cap of the model viviane castro unglued just minutes before starting the parade and had to be re attached with a superglue the beauty however wasnt ashamed to stand there nude in the parade gathering area
5201661 i was so excited the surgery was beautiful my eyes are super pulled just like a geisha it was just what i was hoping for
5201662 they danced beautifully the whole way and not just in front of the judges booths
5201663 the parade of the last escola of the night last night was like a hollywood show and wasnt carnaval

5201667 we expect to see operational efficiencies that will lead to reduced costs
5201668 we also think that employees will appreciate four days of travel to work rather than five
5201669 the biggest impetus was energy costs trying to be more energy efficient and the high cost of gas
5201670 but it readily became apparent that it really isnt just a crisis management initiative i think this is a long term strategy for doing business
5201671 out of a manufacturing plant walking on cement being around that environment so its a much healthier choice
5201672 as you get to the stage where the stakes go up if were going to report somebody publicly thats a big thing
5201673 if we dont have statutory protection my board is legitimately worried that as we get to these higher levels where the consequences are bigger for the audit firms that we will be tied down endlessly in law suits because there isnt statutory protection for cpab for directors for officers
5201674 were now in the smaller group of firms not the big guys the smaller guys were getting repeat offenders
5201675 we need to ratchet up the consequences thats normally how a regulator would work well our ability to ratchet up the consequences may be constrained because of this
5201676 its not a snazzy top of the line kind of thing its important that it get done and it just takes a long long time to handle that kind of change in our system
5201677 violation of the peace agreement and a challenge to progress in mindanao
5201678 because of these sneaky attacks as commander in chief i have ordered the afp and pnp to defend every inch of philippine territory against milf forces and immediately restore peace in affected areas in lanao del norte
5201679 not tolerate and would not crush any attempt to disturb the peace and development in mindanao
5201680 to assess the situation in lanao and other areas in mindanao and come up with concrete firm and decisive action
5201681 i assure our people that the government will defend them at all cost from any move that will disrupt the aspiration for genuine and lasting peace
5201682 we are lawyers and we find ways to interpret the law to the benefit of our clients unfortunately the lack of clarity in the conflicts regime has led to a growth industry in conflict challenges
5201683 if you take a highly specialized area such as competition where a large transaction is taking place it is not only conceivable but has happened that virtually every experienced competition lawyer is conflicted out
5201684 weve found it to be the same case in maritime law in aboriginal law in family law
5201685 there is a strategy out there among clients to make an appointment for legal advice with every experienced family lawyer within a reasonable distance to conflict out their spouse from retaining their counsel of choice
5201686 carried to its ultimate conclusion i would have to pick up stakes and move every five years it is a problem that is felt acutely right across canada
5201687 the duty to protect the confidentiality of client information is indisputable
5201688 it is the inflexible approach to assessing whether or not the duty has been breached that is the source of our concerns
5201689 the duty of confidentiality endures and does not end when a retainer has been completed
5201690 the duty of loyalty on the other hand ends when the retainer ends with the exception of a restriction not to attack the very legal work done for a client or effectively change sides in a matter that is central to the former retainer
5201691 one might more accurately say clarifying we are very clear in our recommendations that a lawyer should not act in a circumstance where there is a substantial risk of adverse effect on a client

5201693 it seems that labours unpopular plans for a national road pricing scheme are alive and well
5201694 they are determined to press ahead with their untried and untested spy in the sky national project even though it looks like an it disaster waiting to happen
5201695 ruth kelly should start listening to drivers and scrap these pilots for a national road pricing scheme that is unnecessary and unwanted
5201696 the contract for the scheme has been put out to let and we are in the process of finalising which companies will oversee it the pilots will be run purely on a voluntary basis with people applying to take part

5201713 i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i did for this country and the population i did with honesty and committment
5201714 i might have made some mistakes but i have hope that this nation and the population will tolerate those mistakes with the belief that my intentions were always clear and to the benefit of this country
5201715 the timing was significant there were reports of a heavy amount of security at the airport and that an aircraft was on the tarmac and that the president might resign
5201716 unfortunately some elements acting for vested interests levelled false allegations against me and deceived people
5201717 they said that during the last nine years our economic problems and electricity shortages were due to our policies it is absolutely wrong and deception for the country
5201718 they never realised that they opposition could be successful against me but they never thought how detrimental it would be for the country
5201719 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5201720 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5201721 everyone says im an army man against democracy i think thats wrong

5201753 developing an alternative method of administering vaccine therapy that is well tolerated by most patients and produces similar immune responses to standard methods may help further the development of vaccine therapies for prostate cancer
5201754 based on safety and feasibility metronomic dosing appears to be superior to standard dosing and administration
5201755 more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this dosing method in treating prostate cancer

5201764 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5201765 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5201766 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5201767 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5201768 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5201769 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution

5201773 as far as the pilots and the west gulf proposal all i can say at this time is theres no need for pilots to take any action on the proposal and we have no further comment

5201785 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5201794 finally feel like you got one back on that hole
5201795 it will be a great satisfaction just to think about you know pulled it off and did it and its a wonderful feeling

5201805 it seems to work well for clinical people as well as the nonclinical people the nonclinical people are able to pick things up quickly and it makes sense to them

5201879 ja kollo is er nog niet maar ik moet toegeven dat de stank de laatste jaren is afgenomen ik woon hier al mijn hele leven vooral tijdens de zomermaanden was de stank vaak niet te harden deze zomer viel het volgens mij wel mee ik denk dat er daarom ook minder wordt geklaagd maar als de wind uit het zuidoosten komt krijgen wij de volle laag
5201880 no hay otro objetivo que informar a la audiencia urbana de que todav a no hay cambios de fondo
5201881 preocupaci n es generar una alternativa con posibilidades de gobernar
5201882 entre los justicialistas creo que sabemos que nos va a ser muy dif cil ganar la elecci n del 2011 por eso es mi preocupaci n para que haya una alternativa con posibilidades de gobernar y eso significa tener estructuras partidarias
5201883 necesitamos partidos fuertes si queremos tener una democracia fuerte y tenemos que tener coincidencias en cuatro o cinco temas que son vitales para la reconstrucci n de la argentina sobre todo los vinculados a la estructura productiva
5201884 luego de las luces amarillas vienen las anaranjadas y ya es tarde
5201885 advierto que el gobierno est como que no se diera cuenta que se prenden luces amarillas despu s de las amarillas vienen las anaranjadas y despu s ya es tarde por eso aspiro a que el gobierno r pidamente tome conocimiento de lo que est pasando en la argentina y haga un viraje
5201886 le podaron todo lo que tiene que ver con la estructura del desarrollo
5201887 se conformaron con el crecimiento que no fue otra cosa que el rebote de una macro devaluaci n que se vigoriz con el aumento de los precios de los commodities pero eso no sigue para siempre
5201888 est probado que hasta ahora no result esa referencia detr s del trono yo creo que debe rodearse la se ora presidente de gente capacitada que sobra en nuestro pa s en todos los planos que hacen a la gesti n y el gobierno

5201899 i was speechless yesterday for a while today i cried
5201900 little jamaica our country is blessed with some of the best if not the best talent you can find
5201901 it was at that crucial moment that the buxom lady in the balcony chose to flash the crowd
5201902 after a comedy routine officially known as filling out the forms i settled into the chair and miss green stabbed me in the arm when i say stabbed i mean freddy krueger has nothing on greenie
5201903 its not that they cant find the solution they cant find the problem
5201904 the act of genius is first of all an act of destruction
5201905 send it to your boss save a copy review it on monday and when youre writing your annual review
5201906 blogs are only effective if you already have a brand
5201907 you cant create a brand just with a blog unless youre ridiculously lucky and business cant be based on luck
5201908 they may visit a blog after they have a relationship with the consultant which just proves my point
5201909 turn down the sound maybe people will lean forward and listen
5201910 when the announcer said hattigs name on the stadium microphone i was thinking to myself where have i heard that name before
5201911 then i heard it announced how he was a big league guy and then it clicked right away oh yeah john hattig it crossed my mind and i was having to think about how i had to get him out at the same time
5201912 thats the only type of thing about this situation that can be a little tricky
5201913 to be honest i wish it could be more like it was where you had these groups of young guys to develop
5201914 but the business at hand is to win and put people in the seats youre incapable of doing that and youre going to look foolish if you insist on building your team around first year players when all the others are beating you with a wealth of experience and talent
5201915 when youre in a developmental league for rookies youre there for specifically that very reason
5201916 their main concern is your growth and development theyre tuning you up its not a matter of your numbers or so much your ability even that is keeping you around
5201917 you get to be patient with your at bats and your innings pitched players cant get that here when youre trying to win a division championship in a season that is already pretty short there isnt that type of time for teams to nurture you
5201918 youre constantly facing guys who have a better playing background
5201919 generally you figure the younger guys in rookie ball are more apt to making mistakes
5201920 the hitters who are more seasoned are the ones that make you earn your outs theyre going to make you battle to find ways to keep them off base
5201921 ive learned a ton from being at the park every day with those guys
5201922 its like how they always say you graduate from college and they give you a piece of paper telling you that you did it but what about life experience how much of that does a college degree give you there are certain situations you have to live through before you can make it by
5201923 i think i played well with the opportunities i got
5201924 and thats what coach mike mccarthy just said after the game for all of us to keep on making the best of the opportunities were getting thats all you can do
5201925 but thats how it goes you cant control how the game goes
5201926 weve got two more games so you just have to hope to get more chances in the next two games
5201927 you can zigzag a bit but if you cross that line you are out of bounds and we will steer you back
5201928 were used to winning it all and we take it for granted a little bit its definitely a wake up call for america
5201929 i kind of got stuck out there and there was nothing i could do after that an 11 20 is so mediocre it is ridiculous
5201930 als u ooit een kopje suiker wilt lenen dan kunt u bij mij terecht
5201931 dit is mijn man henry en de tweeling zijn mijn zoons diederick en hendrik jan
5201932 ik heb henry verteld dat je zo een aardige man bent en dat je er vast geen bezwaar tegen hebt om even op de jongens te passen we hebben inderdaad suiker nodig maar dan een heel pak en bovendien moeten we nog wat andere boodschappen hebben
5201933 in a situation like this a heated contest its just not the right thing
5201934 they are a very good young team and they will probably get better
5201935 i said to myself if i win this match i go meet my flag
5201936 patria es concepto que implica una acepci n psicol gica individual pero tambi n sociol gica y colectiva patria es una esencia la posesi n en com n de una herencia de recuerdos y los recuerdos deben inspirar el presente y el futuro nuestros h roes y nuestros pr ceres han dejado su impronta y un legado hist rico que debemos respetar
5201937 una noche en que est bamos aburridos y el instinto pudo m s que la raz n
5201938 por el tipo de delito si no hay denunciantes no se puede seguir la acci n penal no sabemos si se trata de personas que no quieren tener que ir a declarar por las molestias que eso puede significarles o si en realidad ni est n enteradas de que esta investigaci n est abierta
5201939 entre la direcci n de vialidad provincial del chaco representada en este acto por el ingeniero carlos navarro en su condici n de subadministrador general por una parte y por la otra el ingeniero leopoldo gallegos en car cter de representante t cnico de la empresa sucesi n de adelmo biancalani adjudicataria de la obra proceden a firmar la presente acta de compromiso de inicio de obra para ruta provincial 7 objeto construcci n de obras b sicas y pavimento de acuerdo con lo cual la empresa sucesi n de adelmo biancalani se compromete a dar formal inicio de los trabajos dentro de los veinte d as de firmada la presente acta
5201940 logramos plasmar en este convenio el inicio de una obra que tuvo muchas postergaciones 50 a os de luchas comunitarias que inspiraron el trabajo en conjunto de esta ciudad para lograr la pavimentaci n de la ruta 7 que seguramente de esta obra se construir primero el tramo entre general san mart n y colonias unidas pero tambi n hemos logrado incluir en el presupuesto el tramo entre colonias unidas y presidencia de la plaza
5201941 no nos pusimos de acuerdo en decir nada simplemente los testimonios de nuestros hijos coincidieron en decirnos por separado las mismas cosas en cuanto a los juegos que la maestra les hac a jugar y otras cosas que pasaban en la salita
5201942 in the united states the asian and hispanic population is growing rapidly
5201943 specialized shops serving ethnic groups are among the fastest growing segments of the retail industry
5201944 by the time you are 50 you have bought all of the major purchases once maybe twice you are more focused when you make a purchase
5201945 the environment will have more and more of an impact
5201946 there will come a time when products will be labelled with their environmental footprint
5201947 people were concerned about the downturn in the u s but we were saying its not just the u s
5201948 its everywhere its europe its australia its asia japan contracted and china is slowing their growth rate may still be over eight per cent next year too but they are such a highly leveraged economy in terms of the need to pump out tons of stuff to feed people and a slowdown from 10 to eight or nine for them is catastrophic
5201949 all i was trying to say to people before was its not true that demand is driving commodity prices and the dollar right now
5201950 people didnt want to believe that because it meant that parabolic spikes could continue indefinitely prices could go to the sky and all that
5201951 the fact of the matter was that its a typical scenario just like in the tech run when you had big gains attracting big dollars people chasing and then you have the self fulfilling momentum of things going up because people are getting long just because
5201952 you have the whole strengthening u s currency which takes money away from commodities and youve got demand destruction because of the slowdown in the overall economies
5201953 you broke it now i expect you to fix it
5201954 it took a lot of fiddling but eventually i figured it out
5201955 i got to the point i wanted to be able to do what i wanted to do and saw a niche with the business community that needed to be filled
5201956 i founded vi net computer solutions in september 2006 and have been crawling under desks and pulling wires through the ceilings of small businesses all over halifax ever since
5201957 the exchange rate over the last year or so has made this affordable for a lot more canadians
5201958 if youre able to pay the house off right away thats obviously the best way to go
5201959 but if you have to finance it then you will have to decide whether to borrow in canada or the u s
5201960 the good thing about borrowing in the u s is that you can get a 30 year fixed rate mortgage
5201961 even if youre not a resident for tax purposes youre required to file a tax return in the u s for that rental income
5201962 and because youre a non resident you have to remit 30 per cent of the rental income to the irs each month and then youll either get a credit or pay the difference
5201963 if i could only tell you how much i love you if i could only tell you all
5201964 a deranged woman from stagecoach nevada she convinced one of my people up north that she had one of these things in captivity i supported her allegations until i went out there and found out that she was mentally ill and we sought help for her
5201965 we received unsolicited cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5201966 i objected to the fact that it was a deliberately distorted view of an important female religious figure
5201967 to stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some
5201968 unsere investitionen in die net m maxmedia distributionsplattform und den wachstumsmarkt mobile gaming zahlen sich aus durch unsere erfolgreiche internationalisierung und der zusammenarbeit mit den f hrenden spieleherstellern wie u a ea mobile gameloft und glu erreichen wir gr ere marktanteile und werden zuk nftig h here ums tze und ertr ge erzielen
5201969 i want to thank you all for writing me and being supportive of things that are going on in my life
5201970 the chinese people have done an excellent job everything has been just better than i expected it to be and theyve done a really good job
5201971 i think the girls did a really good job at just really focusing on the task at hand when were not in the gym its time for family and whatever but when were here its our job and we really have to focus if we want to be in the medal rounds its what we have to do
5201972 he needed time to take care of his personal business and we respected that
5201973 but we managed to take care of business on the court while he was gone anyway hes a great guy and its good to have him back
5201974 the other pool is so strong it doesnt really matter if youre the top of the table here all we can do is win our side
5201975 but theres a certain sensibility that you have to go to the source hes the greatest english speaking writer certainly in the dramatic field
5201976 all of us who were in the theater who were involved with the festival cheered and applauded and everyone else kind of wondered why
5201977 has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place
5201978 who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
5201979 i am a competitor i always want to compete and always want to be out there with my team its been hard its been very difficult and it has definitely been a trial for me
5201980 i am not concerned and i wont be even until game week he will be ready to play hes a competitor and he knows exactly what to do and i trust him so im not worried
5201981 if i had to go out there and play today i think i could play i mean i would hurt a bit after but the doctors and our trainer kevin morris have done a tremendous job of keeping me patient and keeping me grounded and letting me know that everything is going to be alright
5201982 ive only been out two weeks i dont think it will be that hard to get back into it
5201983 my acceptance speech was the best speech i ever gave
5201984 and it went on at 3 a m eastern time so nobody saw it
5201985 very future oriented agenda focused on solving key problems like health care well leave the negative messages to the republicans
5201986 and thats how we get competitive in the indianas and virginias
5201987 thats why i pay more attention to the registration figures than to the polls i see at this time of year
5201988 the polls will change but we know we need 200 000 new voters to be competitive in georgia and now is when we have to get them
5201989 the big difference this year is not the technology its the coordination
5201990 the strategy has been ineffective to date at holding down rate hikes
5201991 blue cross confirms that premiums for its hsa linked plans the fastest growing segment of the health insurance market are rising in tandem with older plans
5201992 we are delighted to be working with an experienced well engineering project management company such as spd
5201993 whilst the current turmoil in the financial markets may be responsible for a short term downturn in revenues it will bring with it new opportunities for those able to take advantage of them
5201994 industrial activity in the area has slowed markedly compared to last year the overall effect is expected to be a reduction in revenue of approximately 350 000 on a full year basis
5201995 we would be surprised if opec is able to push prices back we dont expect to see oil rebounding sharply sans significant news
5201996 historically speaking punters are good at picking election outcomes and its clear that they disagree with us that the liberals have no hope of winning
5201997 in the short term we expect prices to remain high relative to historical levels albeit with higher volatility
5201998 conditions in some of our markets deteriorated during the first half of 2008 our growth rates have slowed
5201999 vous aussi vous trouvez cela incroyable depuis que les num ros des tramways ont chang on doit attendre 5 minutes de plus et puis vous savez ils ne sont jamais propres
5202000 lautre jour jai du presque mandier aupr s des usagers pour acheter un direct car le chauffeur navait pas de monnaie sur un billet de 20 eur dans quel monde vit on hein madame

5202002 si si vous verrez vous allez recevoir une belle lettre de retour et un bon valoir sur des tickets
5202003 state bank of india is a stock that can be easily held with a long term view even up to six eight quarters rs 1 325 levels odd will be a short to medium term base support as of now for a longer term player even a longer and deeper stoploss at rs 1 100 odd level can be advised on the upsides rs 1 600 1 610 levels will be the near term resistance and above which should the share starts trading with good volumes and increased open interest i think that would be the signal of a breakout from the short term which could take this stock up to rs 1 800 1 850 levels over the next two three quarters and longer term investors should be seeing the stock going up to the top provided one is willing to wait up to two years timeframe possibly the top might be scaled even earlier but i would advice holding at this point in time
5202004 as long as maxwell industries remains above the rs 20 levels it is doing okay for itself and resistance will come in at rs 32 we need to wait and watch and see whether the stock can actually manage to trade above rs 32 if it actually manages to trade above rs 32 with very heavy volumes i think the stock might edge higher up to rs 37 or even rs 40 levels and thats where one can think of unloading and therefore the potential loss would be reduced substantially at this point in time i would suggest holding on to it
5202005 simboliza uma rela o mais estreita dos dois pa ses
5202006 n o aceitarei uma escolha do governo central o novo comandante ser definido com a minha decis o e aprova o

5202009 we dont want to discourage companies from making legitimate claims but want to reinforce the fact that they have an obligation not to mislead
5202010 ambiguous or exaggerated claims risk generating scepticism and undermine the genuine initiatives that many businesses including shell are taking to be greener
5202011 that was clearly a misleading claim its those sort of things we have wanted to raise concern about
5202012 the reason we got interested in this is that the number of complaints from on the whole ordinary members of the public about environmental claims for products and services has been going up and up i suspect thats largely because environmental concern is rising generally and so companies are using the environmental angle to put their case forward
5202013 the raison detre for the asa is that companies can make the best possible claims for their product but not mislead people
5202014 on quite a number of these issues there is very little official government or national guidance it would help us enormously if things were clearer at national level
5202015 the green claims points can be included in that revision
5202016 but it wont stop there it will have to be continually looked at because this is a fast moving area
5202017 these complaints are coming from shoppers ordinary people the complaints are virtually all about misleading and inaccurate ads not taste and decency issues this is bread and butter stuff for the asa
5202018 what we dont have is any agreement for advertising on companies own websites if its a direct email to you from a company say with an offer it is covered but if you click into a company website thats not covered
5202019 on the whole nowadays a company which has a marketing department has executives who know the rules in most cases they are using advertising agencies who know the codes but the website may be being done by someone else getting the people who draw up website content to think about codes may be the way forward the world of advertising needs to recognise there is an issue and needs to address it
5202020 if that is the case there will have to be some sort of adjudication process on complaints it would be a major expansion of work and we would need income to resource that
5202021 there are a few campaigning groups who are arguing that the rules are not strict enough and there are calls for pre 9pm bans on all advertisements for these foods regardless of the programme
5202022 my own personal view is that would be an overreaction
5202023 my view currently is lets see what the consultation provides on this id say that in five years time the way people watch tv may have changed dramatically and the impact of specific advertising slots may have reduced to such an extent it becomes difficult to finance programmes it might have to be through product placement simply ruling it out im not sure im not wanting to take a definitive view at this stage
5202024 nine out of 10 its easy to underestimate the scale of the task it faced there are moments when they need to pay slightly more attention to the content side of their work than the purely economic and competition side but thats a minor quibble
5202025 im convinced by the case channel 4 is making for their need for assistance in some years time they dont need it now i believe they are a very important part of the broadcasting landscape we must look seriously at where that help could come from
5202026 top slicing is not an option i would rule out completely if i was secretary of state and i had 100m of licence fee money to deploy with public service broadcasting values in mind would i spend it on bbc3 or would i spend it on helping channel 4 i think thats a very difficult question for the bbc to answer
5202027 when im doing my tricks my hair doesnt whack me in the face
5202028 i have so many women who cut their hair to fit into a ponytail and what happens is that they all look the same instead of having a style
5202029 it drives me crazy these are the same people who say i look terrible in short hair well im looking at you in a ponytail and you have short hair
5202030 if you want to wear a ponytail just grab a little piece of hair from underneath wrap it around the elastic bobby pin it and give it some style
5202031 pull your hair back throw your chin to the ceiling and pull it back again
5202032 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5202033 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision
5202034 in an irony sure to set blogger hearts beating giddily the film graces the cover of ews new fall preview issue
5202035 ew and warner bros share a parent company but they clearly do not share you know important information
5202036 i cant answer that i have no idea because i didnt grow up in that world
5202037 i would never in a million years see me doing something like that and i still dont
5202038 just the whole idea of being a judge i find distasteful in a way
5202039 i think at this point youd be hard pressed to find someone going into it not really knowing what they are getting into theyd have to be pretty naive
5202040 i know some of these kids have gone through the mill
5202041 i dont suppose its any different really from the old days when you signed a big record deal it was the same kind of pressure and expectations you were the bait in the shark infested seas i recall that sensation myself you have to have a profound love of the medium of the art to put up with the bollocks surrounding it
5202042 its a free for all a free bashing for all with the internet blogging and also instant photographs
5202043 hed say sass can you come down to the studio jeff beck needs a singer so there id be in the studio singing with jeff beck
5202044 i always thought she was too screechy until i got that job which was an accident kind of
5202045 the irony of it is that i ended up very much appreciating her as a character as an artist and how unusual she was
5202046 i make records for myself and for my fans im lucky enough to be able to indulge myself doing something that i truly adore
5202047 its unbelievably cool and its so exciting to know thats happening in canada
5202048 having an administration thats speaking out where we can point out human rights abuses and the absence of religious freedom that i think is absolutely critical
5202049 to control the durban debate and set the stage for a racist resurgence in foreign and domestic policy

5202051 would you take our picture right there right where youre standing
5202052 did you wonder what itd be like to go over the edge
5202053 the uae has shown a vision for global entertainment and multi faceted theme parks along with their long range potential for financial gain in an insatiable entertainment and travel market
5202054 with so much activity under way there is an abundance of business opportunities and meaaple has been created to enable international and local companies to develop contacts and deliver business in this key growth market
5202055 ive had quite few throws it felt totally free mentally im still trying to search about my approach to the rest of the season

5202077 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent of this country
5202078 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million

5202087 it may explain why his tax plan gives a 600 000 tax cut to the richest 0 1 of earners

5202151 ive also had an orientation toward asia and a recognition that over time we are going to see more economic growth
5202152 we have an economy that frankly for the last eight years has been focused on the very few and we have not seen economic growth from the bottom up

5202186 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials

5202188 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects

5202224 there were a lot of people in my area of ministry who have since moved away
5202225 i heard the vuvuzelas at soccer games and the sound was not musical at all
5202226 vuvuzelas need to play rhythms together to really show their power
5202227 form one of the best fan bases in south african soccer
5202228 in november 2007 we taught 60 of these fans to play seven songs in just five days
5202229 each of our six musicians was responsible for 10 fans and they taught them to play their parts celtic fans also taught us some of their wonderful songs and together we supported bafana bafana at the mandela challenge by singing and dancing with the vuvuzela orchestra
5202230 now we want to bring up a fan base to support our national team
5202231 the vuvuzela music can be learnt very quickly we want to use the celtic supporters as models for a national fan base
5202232 were hoping to attract supporters through various advertising mediums and of course were also hoping to attract the attention of the loc 2010 local organising committee and safa south african football association with an eye to the opening and closing 2010 ceremonies

5202238 we trust that there will be a conclusion very soon there are issues that are outstanding but quite clearly one has no business in negotiating if you are not prepared to compromise
5202239 it is critical that we conclude this dialogue as a matter of urgency

5202266 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5202267 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5202268 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5202269 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5202331 the move from billables to flat fees is not just a practical change its a different way of thinking
5202332 clarify the existing law and to reiterate the original intention of the general court that triple damages are mandatory
5202333 i think the big firms are very conscious that the efficiency of working practices is going to be absolutely fundamental in the coming years we will have to look very carefully at how our terms are structured
5202334 to reflect its broadened scope and influence in business and political worlds internationally
5202335 seriously cool people who recruit amp develop seriously cool people
5202336 when i was offered the captaincy one of the reasons i really wanted to do it was because i believed this side could go to very high places and win trophies
5202337 the guys have done themselves proud this year when we set out at the beginning of the year and looked at what we wanted to achieve it wasnt a project that was going to have immediate results necessarily
5202338 we thought it might take a little while to develop but all i asked was that the guys played their cricket the right way and tried to fulfil the potential they have got
5202339 there were no targets in terms of results or trophies at all we just set up how we wanted to play our cricket and let the results take care of themselves
5202340 so to have won a major competition this year is really testament to how hard the guys have worked they have exceeded that expectation of mine
5202341 he can bowl quick he bowls a heavy ball we know that from facing him in the nets
5202342 and hes been clocked on television games at up to 88 89 miles per hour
5202343 he went a little bit quicker here hes a big strong guy as everyone can see from his hitting of the ball but it also means he can bowl fast
5202344 he has made an effort to get himself stronger and fitter and he is in great condition
5202345 hes one of these lads that has always worked really hard and he has been around for quite a while
5202346 something has just clicked for him and at times he has bowled brilliantly this year
5202347 hes had some great battles with justin langer some of which langer won but he has bowled well at good players
5202348 he bowls well on flat wickets because he has got a bit of pace and he is definitely one for the future
5202349 small gifts given as a gesture of appreciation or gratitude to guests from the bride and groom during a wedding ceremony or a wedding reception
5202350 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5202351 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5202352 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5202353 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5202354 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5202355 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5202356 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5202357 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5202358 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5202359 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5202360 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5202361 i want to make a name for myself in this profession

5202367 the real man smiles in trouble gathers strength from distress and grows brave by reflection
5202368 he that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself
5202369 when we are planning for posterity we ought to remember that virtue is not hereditary
5202370 such is the irresistible nature of truth that all it asks and all it wants is the liberty of appearing

5202383 i need the job for the medical and the health insurance
5202384 i like it when people from seattle or bellevue come out here put them in the maze and all they see is blue skies and corn its escapism i want that authentic farm experience for them
5202385 locking up a journalist for covering election campaign like our colleague mohammed mohamud is legally baseless and is part of widespread campaign to restrict publics right to information

5202409 it used to be that on the upper east side you could get the largest spaces for the best price
5202410 but now were seeing a lot of people coming towards the financial district you can get the same space with all the amenities and everythings new
5202411 it was a no brainer for us for the price the standard of living is so much better
5202412 if youre between 22 and 38 thats pretty much 100 of the people there
5202413 there arent as many new hires and analyst programs are a lot smaller
5202414 i can tell you theres a lot of inventory on the market this summer compared to the past few summers
5202415 when i first came to new york all the investment bankers were on the upper east side
5202416 this is the only time ive ever gotten splinters from sewing

5202418 im going to do a presentation on contemporary classical music its kind of an oxymoron contemporary and classical shouldnt go together but they really do
5202419 i figured that it is rather difficult to talk about music so i brought four pieces to share with you all of which have something to do with portland
5202420 what we do here at shift is basically an ad hocracy
5202421 but we do have a stash of cash in someones basement that they let us get at sometimes
5202422 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed
5202423 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for
5202424 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5202425 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5202426 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5202427 they need it today it would be wonderful today if they had it and got the kids off the street and into a camp like that work hard and earn money and learn what life is all about
5202428 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5202429 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5202430 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5202431 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5202432 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5202433 this government has no chance of establishing trust with georgians
5202434 what he did by restoring constitutional order in his words was only to provoke russia
5202435 promise yourself to think only of the best to work only for the best and to expect only the best
5202436 theyre charging a lot of money for something the homeowners dont need to be paying those kinds of sums for
5202437 we have several suits currently pending against people who were purporting to offer foreclosure rescue and in fact took the houses
5202438 that doesnt seem to put the foreclosure consultant in the right place as an impartial third party buffer
5202439 we werent really doing this last year but there was so much volume that we really felt like we needed to help
5202440 helping people with foreclosure is very difficult some people have really impossible situations
5202441 so if anyone tells you its going to be really easy and quick and all you have to do is pay a few bucks run away
5202442 tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life
5202443 a life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable but more useful than a life spent doing nothing
5202444 our manager said were being too nice but developers are thrilled because were going the extra mile and its karma
5202445 this is the kind of market where we need to do it
5202446 in new development the on site broker and the outside broker are anxious to make deals happen it behooves them both to work well together in the sandbox and thats what youre seeing
5202447 i much prefer the current serene interaction with my colleagues than the fervent and tumultuous one of the housing boom
5202448 the apartment had one buyer but as soon as bear stearns folded i couldnt find him with a private investigator
5202449 but despite her lack of participation i made sure it was a co broker deal
5202450 whereas last year i had eight buyers who were very serious this year i have 14 buyers who dont have as much of a sense of urgency and instead of looking at 15 apartments theyre looking at 30 to make sure theyre making the right decision so to make the amount of money i was making last year im working more
5202451 previously the average cycle for buyers was about four weeks but now its taking up to three months so were working twice as hard to get the same outcome
5202452 were very patient with our exclusives and we have to be very patient with our buyers because theyre skittish about the market
5202453 in the old days it was so easy for developers just to get the walk in traffic and they wouldnt have to pay the commission
5202454 now buyers are unwilling to go forth on sales without a lot of information and developers dont have time for the handholding and education that we have to give the buyers weve always valued the developer and now they value us equally
5202455 developers are definitely trying to reach out to the broker community by doing previews and cocktail receptions
5202456 its hard for developers to get recognized among the cacophony of invitations
5202457 so many new buildings offer the same amenities so the one thing besides the neighborhood that has to stand out is commission
5202458 give them motivation to keep frequenting the building with their clients
5202459 considering making partial prepayments to brokers and then paying in full upon closing
5202460 a 6 percent commission across the board to brokers until the end of summer
5202461 there are a lot more commission incentives going on now than in the past 4 and 5 percent commissions when it used to be more like 2 5 or 3 percent
5202462 with some buildings there are amex gift cards or reimbursements for cab fare when you come to see the buildings last year we had two or three developers inviting us to come see their buildings every week and this year its more like six
5202463 on a 1 million apartment with transfer taxes at 1 8 percent that would amount to 18 000
5202464 substantial price reduction offering brokers a 3 percent commission instead of 4 percent and taking 1 percent off the price might help the purchaser make the decision
5202465 they expressed more interest in buying because of the value they were going to get
5202466 a lot of south americans have invested in florida heavily
5202467 they dont like small studios because the studio isnt common in south america
5202468 one of the reasons is they are familiar with those neighborhoods
5202469 last year there might have been a handful of weekend open houses with limited options and it was hard to get appointments
5202470 now sometimes there can be 15 a day all over the place downtown on the east side and we have a range from small studios to large apartments
5202471 some apartments seem to be staying on the market a lot longer and there arent as many people looking
5202472 this new construction doesnt exist in tribeca or the west village so they have to look downtown
5202473 a lot of foreigners bought investment properties and i told buyers two years ago that it was going to be three years until they started seeing some return a lot of them thought it would be a great flip but now theyre riding out the dip in prices and waiting until the market picks up
5202474 condo buildings are in competition with the really fantastic rental buildings in the area
5202475 rental buildings are offering great incentives like well designed common areas which seem to impress my clients

5202489 londoners have so far been largely insulated from the price falls taking place elsewhere in the country
5202490 however sellers who choose to come to the market during the peak holiday season generally have a greater need to sell and as a result properties coming onto the market in july were on average 21 000 cheaper than last month
5202491 areas that are about to benefit from improved transport links appear to be avoiding the worst of the storm that is setting in elsewhere in the capital
5202492 when looking at trends in the market it is important to remember that uk house prices are significantly higher than five years ago
5202493 the current issue affecting the market is largely about the supply of credit a very different situation to the early 90s which was about high interest rates and unemployment
5202494 the fundamentals underpinning the market remain sound with long term demand for housing low interest rates and low unemployment
5202495 at the time of the attack there were numerous people walking or driving through corporation street
5202496 when it first happened it looked like the plane would go straight down but the pilot recovered it and seemed to be in control of it
5202497 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5202498 we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft which was also hoping to land at coventry
5202499 it looked like the pilot was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised the plane was going down
5202500 it was weird because there was no bang i couldnt believe what i had seen its tragic
5202501 he said the 15 year old aircraft had been recently refitted and was like a new aircraft
5202502 we are conducting a joint investigation with the air accidents investigation branch aaib and warwickshire fire and rescue service to try and find out what has happened

5202508 theres pretty much an aversion to the boroughs if youre born and raised in manhattan and theyre thinking unrealistically about whats out there
5202509 the only goal is to divert them away from where you live

5202511 im close with my parents and they dont really cramp my style
5202512 i dont have to feel weird about bringing people over
5202513 its kind of hard to move out once youve been there for a while

5202529 looking back to the race in laguna sometimes casey stoner leans down a lot more than me so maybe that is something
5202530 in fact sometimes he makes sparks maybe the gear lever i dont know
5202531 for me the problem at brno is that he made a 1 57 2 lap and he saw that it was not possible to pull away so he tried to make 1 56 0 and in the human world that is not possible
5202532 for me the race in laguna was not too bad for his mind but it was very good for my mind
5202533 after barcelona stoner and ducati made a great step they had three races where f k they were very strong
5202534 but in laguna i demonstrated to me and my team that if all is okay then it is possible to beat him so this weekend we worked very well the difference is less than it was at laguna and just for that reason i think he made the mistake
5202535 in the rain we have to improve because stoner is faster than us
5202536 but anyway we are getting stronger and like at the sachsenring and like yesterday we are in second position so we are at least competitive
5202537 race by race were understanding better about the bridgestone tyres and how they work
5202538 at laguna seca we made an important step on how to improve the rear grip and this weekend we followed the same setting and i think the race in laguna was very important for me and my team
5202539 certainly for a team like us we would be looking at that
5202540 youve got the walls and the difficult of getting cars away so theres going to be a lot of safety cars
5202541 we may look at strategies that will put us out of sync with the others so we can take advantage of it
5202542 with strategy youve got to see what the circuit is like and how the tyres perform because that might dictate far more what we do but its something we will factor into our race strategy
5202543 unfortunately these days with the safety car rule that street races can sometimes be affected by performance isnt shown
5202544 but if youre having a shit weekend it could help you
5202545 thats the biggest concern going into these sort of races that if youre having a good weekend the safety car can completely screw you

5202566 es una novela fascinante es muy fragmentaria y la gente no deber a esperar que le atrape pero nabokov consigue con la prosa momentos muy brillantes la trama apenas fulge los personajes son m s bien poco atractivos parece un tour de force de t cnica como las obras tard as de shakespeare en las que despliega su propia t cnica en formas muy muy concentradas el texto es a veces tan grotesco y desagradable como en algunos pasajes de lolita es la clase de escritura que produce admiraci n y sobrecogimiento pero no compromiso

5202579 liu xiang has two injuries one in his foot and one in his leg
5202580 since athens his main goal was to achieve gold in beijing
5202581 todays result was not perfect for all of us and especially liu xiang he has been under great pressure and expectations from all of us
5202582 everyone in the stadium was shocked and horrified and we all felt an array of emotions for the young man because you could see how frustrated he was at being unable to go out there and deliver
5202583 some times when i performed badly i did not want to go out into my town centre because i was embarrassed
5202584 can you imagine how he feels he is on so many posters he is advertising everything here and now the whole nation will not have the opportunity to see him defend his title
5202585 this was going to be the event of the olympic games the one the whole nation wanted to watch now it is going to be very flat
5202586 its not clear exactly when it began but it is six or seven years old it was there before the 2004 athens games and it has been coming and going
5202587 im afraid he wont be able to compete before the end of the year he can barely walk he was in tears hes very depressed
5202588 he has been fighting and fighting until the last moment
5202589 even though he felt the pain he decided to compete in the first heat
5202590 liu would not withdraw unless the pain was intolerable and there was no other way out
5202591 the entire games was almost built around liu xiang since he won in athens everyone you go here you cannot move five metres without seeing an advert of him
5202592 the entire games was about china taking a gold medal that was theirs and it has been taken away from them
5202593 in the past year you can imagine as the games approached the amount of pressure building on liu from the number of people supporting him
5202594 but he was able to carry it in a relaxed way and concentrate 100 on training

5202614 they said that during the last nine years our economic problems and electricity shortages were due to our policies it is absolutely wrong and deception for the country

5202619 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5202620 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5202621 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5202622 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5202623 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5202624 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5202625 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5202626 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5202627 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5202628 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5202629 all we know is that they the skiers were out in backcountry which is like going into the wilderness anywhere things can happen and unfortunately it did out there
5202630 they were just three totally unrelated incidents that were most unfortunate accidents are sometimes unavoidable but we know we have done everything we can to prevent them
5202631 we have had minor avalanches in the resort here but we monitor them closely
5202632 anything that looks dangerous we either fence off or make fall but backcountry skiing is a different thing theres no one out there putting up signs or warning people of hazards people who go backcountry take it at their own risk
5202633 we had 15000 people here yesterday but if it was a dangerous sport there would be a lot more people injured and hurt in this place
5202634 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5202635 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5202636 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5202637 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5202638 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5202639 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5202640 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5202641 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5202642 shawn michaels ha abbandonato il wrestling per colpa di chris jericho
5202643 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5202644 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5202645 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5202646 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5202647 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5202648 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5202649 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5202650 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5202651 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5202656 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5202657 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5202658 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5202659 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5202660 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go
5202661 the new challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station
5202662 and so now with the political realities with russia invading georgia we have a new wrinkle thrown in

5202677 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5202678 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5202679 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5202680 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5202681 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5202682 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5202683 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

5202689 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5202690 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5202691 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5202692 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5202693 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5202694 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5202695 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5202696 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5202697 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5202698 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5202699 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5202700 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5202701 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5202702 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5202703 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5202704 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5202705 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5202706 are you saying that you killed people in cold blood

5202761 when i was younger i dated a guy named ethan who was really critical of me he constantly made little snide comments about my weight how stupid i was and how clumsy i was
5202762 for whatever odd reason i was into him despite the fact that all of my friends and family hated him
5202763 one weekend when he was away i met will at a party and we completely hit it off
5202764 he was the complete opposite of ethan kind sweet and generous yet completely cool and fun too we hung out all weekend and it was like a light bulb went off in my head this is how mature relationship worthy guys act
5202765 i hooked up with will the night before he left and broke up with ethan soon after will and i dated for three years and now were married
5202766 im from florida so i adore going to the beach and boating but my former boyfriend chris a total city boy hated it we always argued about where wed take trips and he always won
5202767 about eight months into our dating i took a trip to key west with my friends and we chartered a boat for the day the captain of the boat was this totally hot complete beach guy for life type and i spent the whole day flirting with him
5202768 we met him out that night and he and i got together i never told chris about it after i got home and i never felt guilty i think part of me felt like thats what chris got for being so stubborn
5202769 oh you dont love the beach fine ill just blow someone in the bathroom stall of fat tuesdays who does
5202770 chris and i didnt make it and after we broke up i made sure any future boyfriends loved the beach
5202771 my last boyfriend was a total player before we got together i thought i could change him
5202772 but i was wrong i always heard rumors that he was hooking up with other girls while we were dating but he always denied it
5202773 and i believed him i mean why wouldnt i what possibly could he have done in his past relationships to lead me to such a conclusion yes what indeed
5202774 one night i got a call from a girl he had been seeing and she detailed their three month long relationship to me and told me about another girl she had discovered he was seeing as well
5202775 oh thats right he was unfaithful before we started dating how silly of me
5202776 i was so mad that i went out with my friends that night dressed to kill and went home with the hottest guy i could find i felt like it was the least he deserved
5202777 i loved seeing the look on his face when i told him about what i did and that i knew about the other girls and then i dumped him
5202778 how can i teach him a lesson that cheating is wrong and hurtful hmmm i know ill cheat on him
5202779 my ex was a terrible kisser the worst i really liked everything else about him but whenever it came time to get physical i just cringed
5202780 one night when i was at a party without him a bunch of people started this old school yet fairly intense game of spin the bottle
5202781 then we played some pin the tail on the donkey things got fairly crazy when mary nearly hit me with a plastic bat when she was blindfolded and swinging at the pinata
5202782 and i felt like i had to join as i hadnt had a decent kiss in a long time
5202783 gosh i feel like i have to join i havent had a decent crack high in a long time
5202784 i probably kissed about 10 guys that night all of whom were so much better than my ex
5202785 i ended things pretty quickly after that experience which made me realize that the physical part of a relationship is truly important
5202786 siguro po ako kasi for a 17 years parang siyempre gusto ko ding mag grow kasi for 17 years nandito ako talagang at home na at home ako dito siguro may mga dumating lang na nagkaroon lang ng mga offer na kahit paano sabi ko siguro nga baka mag grow ako pero thankful ako kay tita cory at tito deo na hindi nila ako pinayagan

5202825 muy bien he recuperado mi felicidad y me siento con mucho entusiasmo para seguir adelante
5202826 s hay que tragar sapos pero s lo por una buena raz n no por nada a cambio
5202827 no podr a ni tendr a que responder esta pregunta lo que hago con la maestra elba esther son acuerdos para la educaci n
5202828 en esta secretar a solamente cumplir con los acuerdos a quienes les debemos son a los ni os a los estudiantes
5202829 mientras se respeten las reglas institucionales y tengamos claros los prop sitos tenemos que considerar acuerdos transparentes
5202830 mis maestros me dieron muy buenas calificaciones en el colegio y m s en disciplina
5202831 estamos ante un reto desafiante es la primera vez en la agenda educativa nacional y lo m s importante es que si el m rito regresa a las aulas cambiar n miles de desempe os en el pa s
5202832 nosotros estamos obligados a seguir adelante es empezar a enfrentar realidades
5202833 claro no tengo duda es una mujer pol tica audaz y cuando da su palabra por lo menos en mi caso hasta ahora la ha cumplido
5202834 no es cuesti n de aprendizaje con ella he construido acuerdos para sumar y lo que quiero es multiplicar para la calidad de la educaci n
5202835 no s si en otras instancias habr una agenda adicional pero aqu es solamente por la calidad de la educaci n
5202836 hay que preguntarle a quienes han tenido que pagarla por lo que sabemos cuesta varios miles de pesos en el menor de los casos
5202837 parece ser que as ha sucedido no tengo una evidencia pero no tengo por qu dudar de que cuando hay discrecionalidad y corrupci n no hay l mites
5202838 hoy estamos hablando de cerca de 7 mil plazas pero a lo largo del a o tendremos alrededor de 25 mil
5202839 s mele de a 30 mil promedio por cada una
5202840 a ver si no la definen la secretar a del 10
5202841 lo que estamos haciendo en esta serie de decisiones es transparentar todo y generar la agenda educativa del pa s estoy consciente del desaf o que representa s que se requiere fortaleza
5202842 apenas hemos tenido voluntad de los gobiernos estatales creo que para todos es un aprendizaje y una apuesta que es novedosa inaudita pero todos sabemos que si no la hacemos no estamos cumpliendo con nuestra obligaci n estaremos traicionando en gran medida los sue os de los mexicanos
5202843 hace muchos a os que estoy a prueba en este pa s las mujeres estamos a prueba en pol tica todos los d as
5202844 hasta ahora parece que vamos aprobando esta materia y no tengo ning n inter s en que cambie mi est ndar de calificaci n
5202845 trabajo incansablemente y quiero de verdad construir con todos muchos puentes
5202846 para transformar en buena medida la agenda educativa del pa s
5202847 en infraestructura para cerrar tantas distancias que hay en el pa s transformar la red de la informaci n de los ciudadanos transformar para crear un nimo distinto y mirar a la escuela como una escuela de todos
5202848 seguramente habr muchos que me calificar n yo solamente quiero seguir haciendo mi mejor esfuerzo
5202849 intento operar igual e incluso con mucho m s actores porque la circunstancia del pa s hoy es distinta la agenda educativa debe ser la agenda de la reconstrucci n nacional
5202850 mi estancia en la sedesol fue probablemente el tiempo donde menos se partidiz la pol tica social donde abrimos los padrones donde se dieron las condiciones para superar la pobreza en gran medida tuve una gran responsabilidad en la campa a de felipe calder n y es sabido por todos que pude hablar con todos los gobernadores en la campa a m s pol mica y creo que ellos jam s hubieran aceptado que hubi ramos tenido un manejo electoral de la pol tica
5202851 estamos totalmente comprometidos he pedido ayuda a la pfp a todos los gobiernos estatales al ej rcito nacional queremos un proceso confiable y cre ble para los mexicanos
5202852 yo tengo la apuesta de que tenemos que hacer todo por creer en ella
5202853 no quiero pensar en eso quiero pensar en que los ciudadanos nos acompa en para que sean ellos quienes nos certifiquen y que somos capaces de hacerlo
5202854 no es parte de la alianza sa ser decisi n de cada identidad federativa
5202855 no yo tengo buena ficha seguramente muy aburrida y mi nico prop sito con las drogas es fortalecer una agenda de seguridad en las escuelas cada ni o que rescatemos ser una vida mucho mejor
5202856 es lograr que los ni os mexicanos aprendan mejor las matem ticas las ciencias que vayan a la escuela con alegr a que aprendan a ser respetuosos tolerantes y que aprendan a amar m xico con un amor mucho m s cercano
5202857 de ninguna manera es una gran apuesta y la educaci n p blica es insustituible
5202858 en primera instancia es responsabilidad del estado pero todos tenemos algo importante que hacer con ella
5202859 deber a de servir para tener m s acceso para tomar mejores decisiones y sobre todo para ser m s humano
5202860 noo eso casi todos quieren ser la verdad es que la educaci n tiene que ser una apuesta de libertad
5202861 s que el presidente est haciendo todos los esfuerzos para que m xico vaya por el camino correcto
5202862 se refiere a los caminos de dar certeza con menos crimen con m s prevenci n y con m s apoyo para el ciudadano
5202863 respeto al ex presidente fox le tengo gratitud y respeto las decisiones del partido
5202864 no coincido con muchos de sus posicionamientos pero simple y sencillamente observo como observan muchos panistas
5202865 cada cual tiene que responder el pan tiene una gran tarea que va m s all de la vida personal de cada uno
5202866 todos tenemos que volver a la escuela nadie puede decir que est suficientemente graduado de la escuela
5202867 con el senador beltrones y con todas las fuerzas pol ticas hay que hacer acuerdos con los prop sitos claros de transformar el pa s para la mayor a de los mexicanos
5202868 los acuerdos requieren voluntad calidad y transparencia nadie con miedos puede construir acuerdos
5202869 pues me gustar a encargarle que haga la parte que le corresponde y que colabore para allanar ciertos caminos sobre todo que le d a cada cual la fortaleza que requiere
5202870 la presidencia no es asunto de dios es de los electores la verdad es que estoy tan ocupada en la agenda educativa ya he vivido una campa a la hice con orgullo fue la m s dif cil de la historia y con eso es suficiente
5202871 con esa campa a ha sido suficiente en mi vida
5202872 para una mujer nunca nada ha sido f cil y creo en que m xico todav a falta vencer muchos obst culos porque se reconozcan y particularmente aqu llos que no quisieron aceptarlo

5202954 this has to be the best camera i have ever used i could not believe the quality of the image and the fact you can watch your video at the track

5203015 it is more easier and more transparent when you negotiate for la liga and premiership than it is when you try to get a domestic league game
5203016 the process is open and the organization of it all is spot on
5203017 fullham struggled last season and then they sign so many new players for the new one naturally it will mean a bit more pressure on us the new ones
5203018 we have to come in and prove from day one that we have added quality to the side that we have made the team better

5203021 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur absolutely no excuse
5203022 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5203023 in recent times the cost of borrowing money short term has come down and that is a considerable benefit to the banks

5203030 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5203031 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5203032 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5203033 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5203042 agribusiness is an important contributor to economic growth in the region and is poised for significant expansion
5203043 given the significant lack of equity risk capital to finance agribusiness transactions the dbsas participation in this fund allows it to play a catalytic role in developing financial infrastructure to provide access to much needed long term risk capital in this critical sector
5203044 agri vie believes sustainable development is best brought about by the disciplines of investment rather than aid grants
5203045 we will not invest in farms but rather in the processing and marketing of farming outputs such as food certain beverages and fibre products

5203058 to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced
5203059 to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits pay and other terms and conditions of employment
5203060 the fmla does not provide leave for leaves sake but instead provides leave with an expectation an employee will return to work after the leave ends
5203061 t he fmla accommodates the important societal interest in assisting families by establishing minimum labor standard s for leave
5203062 there are many similar stories of workers who have been fired when their employers refused to provide an adequate leave of absence
5203063 to prove pretext the employee must do more than show that

5203068 engagement by foreign investors in businesses that can be operated by locals has denied us opportunities created unfair competition or hounded some of us out of business
5203069 i strongly argue against it since i believe that those allegations cannot be true if any investor is seen engaging in small businesses they only finance local people not themselves i think this should be appreciated because it helps local people to have income

5203075 youve got to abort this fetus because we said so
5203076 i dont think they should be punished the life has been taken and the crime has been done
5203077 id love to see a point where it is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary
5203078 we were fortunate in that our nationwide presence cushioned us against the adverse effects of the post election violence that hit certain parts of the country
5203079 im going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer radical social reform is what this country needs right now
5203080 margaret thatcher in her time realised that the big challenge was reviving britains economy and we should recognise that the challenge for the modern conservatives is reviving our society
5203081 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time

5203087 my favourite political quote is by disraeli he said the conservative party should be the party of change but change that goes along with the customs and manners and traditions and sentiments of the people rather than change according to some grand plan
5203088 im going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what this country needs right now
5203089 samantha is actually very unconventional and hard to put in a box she went to a day school was a goth at 14 had quite a wild childhood is unconventional and challenging and that is very good as it stopped me from being too straight down the line
5203090 we sometimes row about politics but id say the most common thing we row about is arrangements

5203093 ive been burgled twice in the last eight years ive had my car stolen and i was on my bike the other day and this white van had been following me stopping and starting this was very late at night about midnight i was coming back from some dinner i got rather nervous about it so i turned down a road i dont normally go down and i slowed down and sort of pulled in behind a line of parked cars and as this van drove by this hand came out and just bashed me in the back with the aim of pushing me in front of the car luckily i managed to put the brakes on but ive never been the victim of proper violent crime
5203094 you appoint good people and trust their decisions but you have to know when to step in william hague has really helped me because he made all the mistakes the first time round
5203095 william hague once said to me being leader of the conservative party and wearing a hat are incompatible
5203096 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that 2007 election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5203097 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5203098 i regret that my government driver took some of my papers home while i was on my bike sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5203099 i remember going for a drink and it was just after john smith died and we said it will be blair who becomes next labour leader and that will be disastrous for us
5203100 now that im starting to lose all this weight i want to look toned
5203101 please accept this decision i am not thinking on personal levels but pakistan first take care of pakistan

5203114 ahora podr an plantearse nuevas soluciones ser a un error no pactar con el pp la pol tica sobre gibraltar y no recabar su apoyo para el foro de di logo creado en diciembre de 2004 para mejorar las relaciones y resolver viejas disputas como el uso del aeropuerto la congelaci n de las pensiones y el tr nsito por la verja
5203115 se podr a avanzar mucho m s si se lograse consenso y sosiego y se evitaran posturas demag gicas que no ayudan al entendimiento

5203129 can this country afford ay more confrontation can the country afford any more economic upheaval
5203130 general musharraf must see the writing on the wall it is time he stopped blustering about contesting the charge against him lent an ear to the saner counseling and quit
5203131 its a family tradition that people come to year after year its always really enjoyable
5203132 this will certainly have a positive effect on the number of children who will be allowed to obtain a quality education

5203136 here i can bring in musicians comfortably to record with
5203137 at home my place is pretty small and it might not be so convenient
5203138 without the co op i wouldnt be able to write my music its enabled me to keep going with my music the musicians in lafayette will be very happy to have a co op
5203139 it bears underscoring that this is not a star making factory in any sense
5203140 this is about real working musicians making incremental improvements to their businesses we give them better tools and a place to work to help them do better
5203141 we would have already been in lafayette five or six years ago
5203142 but katrina knocked everything back about a year and a half we had to regroup this place was flooded
5203143 there is such a music community in lafayette i think of lafayette like i think of new orleans its got a culture and a music culture it couldnt be a better fit for us
5203144 for a town that size it has a much more lively scene than say baton rouge
5203145 its nice to see a community where theres a real scene happening and the community encourages supports and invests in it they have public performance spaces you dont really get that in alexandria they have the opposite take on it
5203146 even though they are programs around the state theres nothing like this theres networking that happens from having offices in four or five different cities
5203147 we felt that to provide the proper level of service and also to secure a reasonable rate based on what were seeing going on in the state today this was the best thing to do
5203148 im hoping we can come forth with something a little better unfortunately we have some citizens who are not as well off as others and every single dollar counts
5203149 its pretty strict and hopefully gives them even more impetus to perform well
5203150 i just dont see how this is going to help our problem i have a problem with what were paying right now anyway
5203151 its going to be more out of pocket for us and no better service

5203212 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5203213 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5203214 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5203215 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5203216 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5203217 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5203218 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

5203220 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5203221 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5203222 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5203223 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5203224 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5203225 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

5203268 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5203269 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5203270 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5203271 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5203272 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5203273 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5203274 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5203275 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5203276 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5203277 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5203278 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5203279 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5203280 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5203281 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5203282 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5203283 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5203284 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5203285 i fear that something of great value has ended forever
5203286 we live today in a climate of religious pluralism and doctrinal confusion
5203287 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5203288 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5203289 the ffa in conjunction with the police and the security company have worked hard to ensure there are no problems at any of our matches
5203290 we have asked for reports and we will consider the next step after we have studied them hopefully we will be able to identify the culprits we certainly have the option of banning the fans from all a league games in the future as well as any internationals that come under our jurisdiction
5203291 it should be pointed out that it is only a very small group of fans who are intent on causing problems while the vast majority of true football followers behave themselves impeccably
5203292 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5203293 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5203294 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5203295 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5203296 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5203297 those who do not have to sell are holding off
5203298 a surprising number of new buyer registrations and viewings have led to an upturn on offers and sales over the past four weeks
5203299 mortgages are not getting easier but they are getting cheaper and criteria is softening for some groups such as those with substantial deposits
5203300 these boroughs will see the benefit of new transport links in the near future but did not experience the knee jerk boom in asking prices that the initial olympics announcement generated in newham
5203301 as developed economies experience further weakening in the coming quarters
5203302 while there are enough resources to satisfy the worlds appetite the industry has not moved quickly enough to meet the growth in demand
5203303 there could be some supply disruption issues there so the market is watching this closely
5203304 the market will probably get through this hurricane news pretty quickly
5203305 i think its important that we have someone take an objective look at our operations and our staffing levels
5203306 we have not had an increase in staffing levels since 1997 but we need to determine what the appropriate staffing level should be
5203307 more often than not theres only one person on duty to handle all that
5203308 we also have the challenge of being a retail mecca half the time
5203309 although we have a population that is less than 20 000 people at night our demands are significant at all hours of the day because we have such a significant amount of retail including st clair square
5203310 i get a lot of residents who dont feel like we have enough officers on the street
5203311 sales tax is what the city operates on people have to feel safe to come here to shop
5203312 such as a finance director theres a lot of things the city needs we have a good police department
5203313 some homeowners who live along corridor believe this is leaving us in limbo for years and years
5203314 should we improve our homes or not we may not be here long enough to enjoy it
5203315 more times than not a homeowners construction of a pole barn is not a big concern for the state
5203316 we believe this project the gateway connector underscores the need for a comprehensive statewide plan
5203317 harm is not of course just to those inside the corridor but many more who value the lifestyle out here and the taxes that accompany all that area are horrendous
5203318 it makes it tough on everybody not just those in the corridor

5203328 all history is about roads until the airplane came along
5203329 the reason were sitting here today is because the road came through
5203330 it was the only way through the two counties after a flood that you didnt have to cross a river
5203331 when the military cut the road they werent just going off into uncharted territory
5203332 it looked very much like any other log home with a spinning wheel and a cast iron skillet
5203333 in the 1820s the cherokee nation was only a fraction of what it once was

5203555 no queremos que esta vez se convierta en un intercambio de ropa usada
5203556 cuando el trueque estuvo en su mejor momento el quiebre fue que no se guard la cultura del trabajo
5203557 no cuentan con muchos recursos econ micos y son familias muy numerosas con lo poco que tienen y por la suba de precios y la escasez de algunos productos ellos dijeron reun monos y terminaron yendo el primer d a m s de 30 familias hasta los ni os intercambiaron bolitas por figuritas
5203558 la crisis producida en los ltimos 100 d as fue el impulso final para salir a reflotar el trueque porque afecta m s al consumidor de abajo
5203559 la recesi n encubierta provoca que la gente necesite m s de los alimentos que consigue en el trueque como el alimento est caro el que produce puerros puede ahora cambiarlos por los huevos que produce el que tiene una gallina

5203627 if i had to go out there and play today i think i could play i mean i would hurt a bit after but the doctors and our trainer kevin morris have done a tremendous job of keeping me patient and keeping me grounded and letting me know that everything is going to be alright

5203679 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
5203680 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 per cent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
5203681 millions of people depend on freshwater fisheries as a major food source
5203682 freshwater food stocks can provide up to 80 per cent of dietary protein for the 60 million people of the mekong basin for example and thats just one river
5203683 freshwater systems are home to around 40 per cent of all the species on earth
5203684 and our impact is shown by the fact that we are losing these species faster than any other
5203685 a global treaty for co operatively managing rivers and lakes that cross or form borders is still languishing in limbo more than a decade after being approved by a clear majority in the united nations
5203686 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
5203687 maintaining the health of freshwater ecosystems has to become one of the major aims of freshwater management generally
5203688 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaption to climate change rather than doing it
5203689 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future
5203690 it is ironic that currently it is not foresight and planning but major natural disasters that lead to significant efforts to repair damaged rivers and wetlands foresight and planning now will reduce the risk and damage from future extreme weather events while having many economic social and environmental benefits
5203691 that has nothing to do with the camps the hatred of israel comes from israels occupation which burdens our hearts
5203692 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5203693 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5203694 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5203695 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5203696 the problem has been very serious for the past many years we contractors do have a lot of problems with the awarding officers most of whom are civil servants most of them want to benefit from where they have not sowed so after paying social insurance dues taxes and others most of the money for contracts ends up in the pockets of civil servants
5203697 the chiefs are not supposed to force contractors to pour libation thereby putting a lot of huddles on them some of them go very far by asking for lump sums of money
5203698 have you ever heard of 20 or 30 percent that is what they were asking so if you have already paid fcfa 2 million out of fcfa 10 million for taxes and some body is again asking you for 20 or 30 percent of the balance than you already know how much you are losing

5203738 the associated press document provides additional evidence suggesting the obama campaigns insistence that obama was never trained in islam and he never lived as a muslim is not accurate
5203739 moreover the document indicated that obama may have been an indonesian citizen when he lived there
5203740 this is an issue the obama rebuttal fails to address at all evidently conceding the accuracy of the claim

5203770 thats how golf goes its four rounds 72 holes and anything can happen
5203771 vous verrez souvent une fille qui nest pas si attirante que a marcher dans la rue un sourire aux l vres sans savoir si cest parce quelle vient de se souvenir dune chose ou quelle en anticipe une autre

5203774 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5203775 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces
5203776 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity
5203777 in the future i put myself to the people of pakistan to decide about my future and they will do justice
5203778 i am very satisfied with whatever i could do for this country
5203779 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning
5203780 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5203781 this is an issue that is not on the table
5203782 ive got a great crew but we are still not where we want to be with the plane
5203783 so i am still waiting for someone to make a small mistake in order to win i think we are going to be doing that throughout the year
5203784 its a bit of a relief really because expectations were you are going to win it
5203785 that fear of failure is there in any sport be it swimming or cycling or flying so in a way it is nice to get it out of the way there is only one place that you can go if you keep winning and that is down hopefully from seventh i can only improve
5203786 the only thing i wish i could do but cant is reduce the weight because the plane is too heavy
5203787 my focus is to concentrate on clean flying and get the plane as efficiently and quickly around the track as i can
5203788 when the first three pilots in the championship rankings hit a pylon and then you put in clean run then it is pretty easy
5203789 he would have been much quicker than me had he not made a mistake
5203790 it is to be expected a little that paul would come under pressure because all the attention was on him
5203791 we will change the engine tomorrow because the engine is very weak
5203792 ill hopefully be able to fly a couple of hours before the race on the new engine and hopefully it will be ok

5203796 estamos a chegar a um limite no sector petrol fero e portanto o crescimento nos pr ximos anos vai depender muito da diversifica o que se vai dar na economia

5203803 mas o aumento da produ o de petr leo e a subida de pre o dos produtos petrol feros n o explicam tudo
5203804 n o se pode esperar que a distribui o da renda mude substancialmente em seis anos
5203805 o que se pode esperar um enfoque na redu o da pobreza e na igualdade de oportunidades de emprego

5203818 the game was exactly what we needed the ideal work out at this stage of pre season
5203819 doncaster are very physical and a hard bunch at home certainly in the first half they wanted to put a mark on us
5203820 they were physical to make sure we knew we were in a contest
5203821 we played into a strong first half breeze and although we made some changes we knocked on and any rustiness we had was evident
5203822 but in the second half we made our chances count and took advantage of the wind to put some good kicks in field and attacked with real purpose we were rewarded with some good tries
5203823 overall i thought we did very well with the new laws
5203824 there were a couple of areas where we need to sharpen up but we have got to be happy with how we took them on board and used them in a real live game
5203825 what was you fill in the blank when it was real
5203826 see that star up there in the sky thats ellie
5203827 im a baby cheetah today no im a timberwolf oh yeah a bengal tiger um no a cheetah yeah im a cheetah today but not a baby one im a medium one and you can be the mommy cheetah

5203844 this is not a day to glorify war its about remembering those we lost and honouring those who served
5203845 you dont know each other when you start but soon youre best mates
5203846 since the welcome home parade in 1987 people have been more willing to share their experiences but some still feel locked in behind closed doors
5203847 id urge them to come out its good to talk to people who have been through similar experiences it helps to bring closure
5203848 for 20 years weve been trying to get some sort of action
5203849 its not something new but it has escalated we have numerous examples of people cutting down vegetation damaging the dunes in one case they have completely denuded the dunes we have photographs
5203850 a resident was caught cutting down all the trees for a better view in preparation for selling the house she admitted to it we saw her but nothing was done
5203851 if you walk along the beach you can see dunes have been paved with tables and chairs placed on them
5203852 they have no concept that the dunes are the last line of defence protecting their properties and this is not just happening in suffolk park i know of properties in new brighton where the same thing is happening
5203853 council is concerned about these encroachments known as creeping backyards the extension of backyards into the reserve has caused serious degradation of the coastal foreshore and its associated ecosystems
5203854 he has certainly had worse coughs in the past but the warnings issued by the school made me get him tested we have kept him home because the children here have such close contact with each other
5203855 the problem is that this cough doesnt sound like the usual whooping cough which causes many parents to believe their child only had a common cold or flu
5203856 the north coast is still experiencing a very high incidence of whooping cough illness particularly in the northern part of the area the areas where we see most cases are in byron lismore and murwillumbah which have low vaccination rates
5203857 we are seeing over three and a half times the number of cases that we would normally see at this time of the year compared to the previous five year average
5203858 i think we are very lucky that of the 368 cases on the north coast we have not had anyone die eleven children were hospitalised and 10 of those were unvaccinated
5203859 now the parents are vigilant and responsible understanding the need to keep their children at home until they have completed the course of antibiotics and are no longer infectious it requires vigilance
5203860 while were being very proactive at this school and ensuring that our parents are aware of the ripple effect such a virus has on the community many schools still dont even know theres an outbreak
5203861 the jockey can ride them and the trainer can prepare them really well for the race
5203862 but at the end of the day the horse has to want to win
5203863 so i am always appreciative of it when they do
5203864 but she steadied and they left him i was pleased they didnt take him on
5203865 emily had an excellent ride she did everything i asked including giving him a rest at times
5203866 i got him to the front and was able to give him a nice rest to the straight and then he found plenty
5203867 but southern cross university whale researcher christine fury said it was likely to have drowned when it was born
5203868 it had lacerations on its back from being tumbled on the rocks in the rough swell
5203869 its good to grow up doing something like this it teaches responsibility and how to look after horses and its a good family sport that everyone can get involved in
5203870 hes got two competition horses and he just loves it
5203871 i hope campdrafting stays with the family for generations to come
5203872 well have about 700 runs by the end of the weekend including the finals
5203873 and well have about 860 head of cattle here we couldnt do it without the cattle donors who lend us their cattle for the day
5203874 there are 13 different people from around the district who donate their cattle so we can hold the event
5203875 the request for indonesian police to arrest paul francis callahan on the interpol wanted list has been completed
5203876 he has denied the accusations in court but this is not an examination of the criminal case
5203877 according to paul the alleged victim asked paul to get married but he refused
5203878 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5203879 alles loopt op schema ik heb de film gezien hij is fantastisch mochten we willen kunnen we hem in november al uitbrengen de stakingen van schrijvers in hollywood eind vorig jaar hebben invloed gehad op het uitbrengen van de blockbusters van de zomer van volgend jaar
5203880 hierdoor ontstond de mogelijkheid de film te verplaatsen naar een open weekeinde in het drukke zomerseizoen
5203881 sudahlah begitulah orang jangan terlalu dipikir hanya menghabiskan energi saja tetaplah berbuat baik kalau kamu begitu keihklasanmu akan seperti debu yang tertiup angin maka hati yang mendongkol akan menggerogoti amalanmu seperti kayu kering yang dimakan api
5203882 working out keeps me sane cooking keeps me connected to my roots
5203883 i remember the 70s waiting in line for gas what have we done since then shame on us
5203884 its unconscionable for the state bureaucracy to be blocking approvals when families and businesses are suffering daily from outrageous energy costs
5203885 it seems as though theres too much wind in the newark offices of the bpu and not enough determination to get offshore windmills tested promptly
5203886 if you dont take the first step youre not going to get there
5203887 this is the first time we are considering offshore wind
5203888 it is one of the first times in the united states its been considered its something you want to do right
5203889 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst

5203897 if upgrading from an earlier version of synctoy e g synctoy 1 4 or synctoy 2 0 beta it is critical to ensure that all folder pairs are fully synchronized using the previous version before running synctoy 2 0 setup not following this guideline can lead to unintended behavior and partial data loss when running synctoy 2 0 for the first time after upgrade all folder pairs must also be fully synchronized at least once right after the upgrade is done

5203902 it dont mean a thing if it aint got that swing
5203903 no human ever filled a vessel worse than the stomach
5203904 no human ever filled a vessel worse than the stomach sufficient for any son of aadam are some morsels to keep his back straight but if it must be then one third for his food one third for his drink and one third for his breath
5203905 if the people only used these words they would avoid all diseases and maladies and the clinics and pharmacies would be idle
5203906 that which has killed mankind is the introduction of food on top of food before it has been digested
5203907 o son of adam eat with one third of your stomach and drink with one third and leave one third of your stomach to breathe so that you may think
5203908 something which aids in digesting your food after you eat
5203909 i have not eaten to being full for four months that is not because i am not able to do so but i was with a group of people who were hungry more than they were full
5203910 whoever eats little will understand and make others understand and will be clear and humble
5203911 whoever takes control of his stomach gets control of all good deeds
5203912 i have eaten until i am no longer able to eat
5203913 subhaanallaah does a muslim eat until he is no longer able to eat
5203914 i have not filled myself in sixteen years because filling oneself makes the body heavy removes clear understanding induces sleep and makes one weak for worship
5203915 the believer eats with one stomach while the kafir eats with seven stomachs
5203916 food for one is enough for two and food for two is enough for three and food for three is enough for four
5203917 the family of muhammad sal allaahu alayhe wa sallam never filled themselves with wheat bread three days in a row from the time he came to madeenah until he passed away
5203918 then they were followed by generations who neglected the prayer and followed their appetites
5203919 the best generation is my generation followed by the one after them then the one after them then will come a people who bear witness but are not asked to bear witness who swear oaths but do not fulfill them and fatness will appear among them
5203920 my greatest fear for you is the appetites of transgression with regard to your stomachs and your privates and the inclinations which lead astray
5203921 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5203922 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5203923 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5203924 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5203925 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5203926 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5203927 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5203928 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5203929 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5203930 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5203931 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5203932 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5203933 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5203934 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5203935 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5203936 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5203937 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5203938 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5203939 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5203940 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5203941 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5203942 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5203943 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5203944 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it

5203967 from the details coming out of ashgabat in turkmenistan and moscow over the weekend it is apparent that the great game over caspian energy has taken a dramatic turn in the geopolitics of energy security nothing like this has happened before the united states has suffered a huge defeat in the race for caspian gas the question now is how much longer washington could afford to keep iran out of the energy market
5203968 it seems that shift of russia energy export policy is under way russia might turns its eyes from the western countries to the asia pacific region the cooperation in the energy sector is an issue of great significance for sino russian relations the political and geographic closeness of the two countries would put their energy cooperation under a safe umbrella and make it a win win deal china russia are at their best times the two sides settled their lingering border disputes held joint military exercises and enjoyed rapidly increasing bilateral trade

5203982 i mean i want to smoke em and im sure they want to smoke us i just think it would be a really fun match
5203983 it would be intense youd see a lot of crazy plays crazy hits the whole nine yards i think youd see four friends having a really good time
5203984 the nervous energy has gone away for the most part now its just about playing and having fun
5203985 the first match even though i didnt feel nervous there was definitely some nervous energy out there now its just sort of enjoy the moment have a good time youre in the olympics
5203986 the ultimate goal is to win a gold medal but its the olympics and you have to enjoy it if a team plays well enough to beat us so be it hopefully that wont happen but im just going to enjoy myself from here on out
5203987 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year

5204383 if you went back 15 years the matron was on the ward and cleaners were employed by the hospital and there seemed to be a lot of pride on the ward
5204384 theres been a great response already to the letter but frankly every senator should sign on because its irrational to say no to proven american energy during this energy crisis
5204385 youre going to see a lot of people talk about the possibility of a shutdown but as to how far it goes it depends a lot on things you cant predict right now
5204386 piccolo mio sei perfetto nei tuoi sbagli sei tutto ci ke mi serve per andare avanti grazie ale sei la mia vita
5204387 es gibt keinen grund f r katerstimmung aber auch keinen zum durchfeiern der aufschwung verlangsamt sich die risiken nehmen zu wir werden aber die 1 7 wachstum erreichen die wir f r dieses jahr prognostiziert haben
5204388 deshalb sind wir bis jetzt mit den hohen energiepreisen und dem schwachen dollar noch gut zurechtgekommen
5204389 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5204390 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5204391 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5204392 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5204393 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5204394 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5204395 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5204396 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5204397 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5204398 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5204399 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5204400 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5204401 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5204402 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5204403 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5204418 the key message to people is just dont leave the gps in the car

5204434 the important thing is not to win but to take part
5204435 in your first shot you only got 7 9 points what is the reason for this
5204436 i have been doing this sport for 23 years i have been nurtured by my country in that time i have let my country down
5204437 obviously my swing was there this week and my putter but there wasnt really a tee shot i didnt like
5204438 usually you have two three shots i never felt awkward with any tee shots or anything like that it set up great for me
5204439 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off
5204440 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me
5204441 i kind of felt like i let the tournament slip away on 10 and 11
5204442 i told myself on the next tee box i got my momentum
5204443 finally feel like you got one back on that hole
5204444 it will be a great satisfaction just to think about you know pulled it off and did it and its a wonderful feeling
5204445 doesnt happen that often in golf unless youre tiger woods
5204446 second place is obviously tough to swallow right now but ill probably be pretty happy here when i realize ive got a job for the rest of the year
5204447 i knew i had to play my butt off just to make it up there
5204448 i didnt want to have four weeks off you know and im glad at least i got into the first one
5204449 de successen die zijn geboekt mede gefinancierd door de wereldbank blijven beperkt tot het noordelijk deel van het meer

5204451 er is op dit moment voldoende reden om te veronderstellen dat de van gansewinkel groep in staat zal zijn een positieve kasstroom te blijven genereren om aan haar verplichtingen te voldoen
5204452 nu is het nog te vroeg om te zien of ze voldoende recupereert
5204453 we wachten dus af tot morgenvroeg de beslissing hangt vooral van de fysieke aspecten af hoe het mentaal zit met haar na haar uitschakeling op de 100 meter het is nog te vroeg voor haar om alles te kunnen plaatsen het is voor haar vooral nog een groot vraagteken wat er precies gebeurd is
5204454 sowieso had de starter het als een valse start moeten beoordelen of ze zelf haar arm had moeten opsteken zijn vijgen na pasen in elke normale omstandigheid wordt ze teruggefloten zoiets als gisteren is totaal nieuw op zich heeft haar uitschakeling geen invloed op het aflossingsnummer kim zet zich in elke situatie altijd voor de volle 100 procent in en zal dat ook nu doen

5204459 any investment strategy that allocates significant portions of the portfolio to volatile or illiquid assets
5204460 the whole point of the new policy is to make it far less likely that congress will have to engineer a bailout
5204461 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5204462 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5204463 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5204464 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5204465 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5204466 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5204467 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5204468 i have to urgently move to new york in the next week and would like to find a good home for my kitty
5204469 all the children were breathing and conscious but as a precaution we wanted to make sure that their health and safety were considered
5204470 the thing that got us thinking about this was number one how do we get more people involved in following what goes on in local government
5204471 for many people it has been high priced and difficult for them to transfer money via existing services even to friends and family using mobile phones solves the problem
5204472 wir sind gut unterwegs wir werden in diesem jahr bereits in die n he kommen insofern geht der blick hier eher nach oben als nach unten
5204473 ich gehe davon aus dass sich der margenschwund in der zweiten jahresh lfte verlangsamt

5204475 we have casual fridays so i was wearing a pair of jeans and an old ratty sweater
5204476 and that turned out to be my wedding dress because there was no time to change when the call came
5204477 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5204478 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5204479 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5204480 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5204481 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5204482 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5204483 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5204484 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5204485 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5204486 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5204487 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5204488 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5204489 i am the other woman just came and told me she was getting my reservation
5204490 well you have to give her your passport did she take your passport

5204497 saya lebih memilih rafael sobis mengingat cara dia berkembang dalam latihan dan selama pertandingan dia adalah pemain yang bisa lolos dari penjagaan ketat membuka ruang bisa berlari diagonal dan tidak terperangkap off side

5204499 pato membutuhkan sedikit polesan dia harus tahu caranya menghadapi pengawalan ketat dan membebaskan diri darinya
5204500 ik begin de voorstelling meteen met een lied een vrouw in dit land mag alleen niet solo zingen dus een mannelijke collega acteur werd gevraagd om mee te neuri n bij de liedjes op die manier was het wel toegestaan het was best hilarisch om opeens iemand mee te horen neuri n op de achtergrond
5204501 ze hadden ook kritiek over de aanrakingen op een gegeven moment komen de armen van mijn zoon max om mij heen de armen van de pop zijn ook de armen van een mannelijke acteur die achter de pop staat dat mag niet mannen mogen vrouwen niet in het openbaar aanraken ik heb dat opgelost door mijn eigen armen om me heen te slaan
5204502 we merkten dat het publiek niet tussendoor klapt en zich niet uit we dachten eerst o jee ze vinden het misschien niet leuk maar achteraf kregen we hele enthousiaste reacties tijdens de voorstelling kijken en luisteren ze gewoon

5204511 what kind of dives has this guy been staying in
5204512 sounds like this writer went native long ago and now holds court at the local whore house
5204513 travel writing works in a cyclical manner we write about a place people go there and then we must continue to write about the place because it has become a tourist destination unfortunately with success and development comes a change and the tourist friendly places just get busier pricier and more touristy they often become places where i would not want to spend my vacation time but we have to acknowledge their popularity nevertheless sometimes up and coming spots are added because they are listed in a competitors guidebook because a writer such as myself finds them unique and squeezes them in or because they have become hotspots as the result of overflow from the other destinations in the book most cities and towns clubs and restaurants beyond those are passed over or given a short mention in the guidebook as such although guidebooks give the illusion of open ended adventure and possibility and claim that they seek to serve the independent traveler they are often little more than a paper arrow pointing down an overhyped tourist route or gringo trail so to speak
5204514 how do you expect me to cover and write about the entire region for six grand
5204515 i woke up this morning with this numb tingling in my foot

5204521 please dad no more im already dealing with jillians cra ziness
5204522 she was she drops in on family life whenever she feels her ovaries pinch she thinks its useful to hear some screaming kids and witness a few fights so that her career will stay on track
5204523 dont ask her that question shes so certain stardom is around the corner she organizes her own entourage sort of
5204524 she telephoned collect to ask me to pick her up at the airport there i was wrestling my demonically possessed kids into snow suits and tearing out to the airport only to discover that shed called a half dozen other people to meet her flight youd think she was returning from a kidnapping ordeal in afghanistan in stead of a couple of months in toronto the only thing lacking was banners not that she wasnt looking around for them of course maybe she needed that many cars to carry her luggage
5204525 what do you think will bring her down to planet earth
5204526 i know one thing that would bring her down to earth find ing a husband having two screaming kids developing cellulite
5204527 what are you going to do daddy if jillian cleans you out what are you going to do daddy if you go broke before you croak
5204528 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires

5204536 eine unterst tzung der fp f r die faymann sp kommt nicht in frage
5204537 die anderen parteien sollen verdrehungen verbiegungen und purzelb ume r ckw rts machen wie sie wollen
5204538 diese umfrage zeigt deutlich dass der eingeschlagene weg die unansehnliche wildplakatierung durch ein legales und reguliertes system zu ersetzen der richtige ist uns freut dass die wienerinnen unser konzept so positiv aufgenommen haben

5204540 der fonds gesundes sterreich hat seit 1998 ein programm das sich in einem satz zusammen fassen l sst gesundheit erhalten ist besser als im nachhinein krankheiten zu behandeln

5204542 die freigabe der studiengeb hren f r studierende aus nicht ewr l ndern stellt eine schwerwiegende diskriminierung dar die auf eine weiterf hrung der fremdenfeindlichen politik der letzten jahre hinweist
5204543 die entmachtung des senats ist ein weiterer schritt um die studierenden von ihrem mitbestimmungsrecht fern zu halten
5204544 die rektorinnenwahl in eine neu einzurichtende findungskommission zu verlagern verringert die mitsprachem glichkeiten der studentischen kurie weiter
5204545 die zugangsbeschr nkungen wurden nicht abgeschafft stattdessen erlaubt der entwurf qualitative zulassungsbedingungen f r alle masterstudien
5204546 diese unkonkrete formulierung gestattet es den universit ten sich ihre studierenden nach dem bachelor auszusuchen und masterstudien zu eliteprogrammen zu machen
5204547 mit recht mahnt die armutskonferenz den dringend erforderlichen kurswechsel in der sterreichischen energiepolitik ein
5204548 die fp verweist seit langem darauf dass die hohen und weiter steigenden energiepreise vor allem die bezieher niedriger einkommen vor gr te probleme stellen auch energie zu sparen oder der umstieg auf erneuerbare energietr ger ist f r diese bev lkerungsgruppe besonders schwierig
5204549 man muss nat rlich geld in die hand nehmen um den altbau und altwohnungsbestand ad quat zu sanieren
5204550 zum anderen ist damit eine markante senkung der heizkosten zu gew hrleisten
5204551 wir haben in unseren antr gen alle f r die umsetzung dieses ansinnens relevanten parameter aufgelistet die von der beschleunigten einf hrung des geb udeenergieausweises ber adaptionen der landes bauordnungen und die schaffung eines tragf higen erneuerbare energien gesetzes ein verbot von l und erdgasdirektheizungen in neubauten und den verpflichtenden einbau von solaranlagen in mehrgeschossigen wohnh usern bis hin zu fachlich fundierter energieberatung reichen
5204552 die kosten f r die sanierung des gesamten altbestandes in sterreich beziffert hofer mit 80 milliarden euro
5204553 diese 800 millionen euro direktzuschuss j hrlich sollen einen beitrag leisten um zu einer raschen sanierung des althausbestandes zu kommen denn soziales wohnen hei t in zukunft nicht mehr dass man billig zu einer wohnung kommt sondern dass man sich die betriebskosten leisten kann
5204554 unser weg f hrt aus der sich stetig versch rfenden energiekostenkrise
5204555 was zur realisierung alleine fehlt ist der politische wille eine reform des heizkostenzuschusses zu verlangen klingt plausibel heizkostenzusch sse k nnen aber generell nur als akut und nothilfe verstanden werden und keinen dauerhaften beitrag leisten sterreichs haushalte in energiefragen zukunftsf hig zu machen

5204561 ha sido un espect culo impresionante y un xito incre ble del tenis espa ol ganar la medalla de oro en los jj oo y en las condiciones en las que lo ha hecho es impresionante no se ha dejado asustar por nadie y eso que lleg cansado m s mentalmente que f sicamente pero cuando le vi ganar a hewitt ya le vi campe n
5204562 tenemos una gran suerte para el tenis espa ol al tenerle a l nadal ha demostrado a un se or que se llama federer lo grande que es pero ahora tendr mucha presi n porque ser el punto de mira de todos los jugadores que intentar n ganarle como sea
5204563 personalmente he sentido una satisfacci n enorme yo fui n mero uno del mundo tambi n aunque oficiosamente en 1966 por la federaci n internacional cuando entonces esa clasificaci n se hacia con el voto de cuatro prestigiosos peri dicos internacionales y no exist a a n la atp suced a roy emerson que lo hab a sido en 1965 y fue algo incre ble porque entonces el tenis estaba dominado por los americanos y australianos pero ahora rafa ha demostrado que es el mejor cuando el tenis se ha extendido por todo el mundo
5204564 nadal ha demostrado su val a porque durante dos a os ha sido el n mero dos del mundo detr s del mejor jugador de la historia roger federer demostrando su categor a y nivel
5204565 lo que ha conseguido este a o con victorias sobre federer en roland garros y wimbledon ha sido genial rafa tiene un palmar s inigualable y no es una casualidad que sea n mero uno del mundo
5204566 nadal tiene nivel para ser n mero uno del mundo durante mucho tiempo su manera de jugar hace que gaste mucha energ a pero cada vez que lo veo por televisi n observo que t cnicamente va mejorando y que va desarrollando una gran experiencia se dosifica cada vez mejor y sus golpes son m s definitivos
5204567 ha mejorado mucho y aunque sabe que hay jugadores que pueden ponerle en aprietos sabe tambi n que si el partido va muy duro l les puede apretar al m ximo
5204568 ha sido una gran victoria ganar la medalla de oro en los juegos ol mpicos y coronarse n mero uno del mundo al d a despu s es perfecto y rafa se lo ha ganado a pulso
5204569 nadal ha estado mucho tiempo detr s de roger federer y lo ha logrado y creo que ser n mero uno del mundo durante mucho tiempo
5204570 federer est herido y tocado desde que perdi la final de roland garros y encaj aquel 6 0 en el ltimo set
5204571 eso le hizo mucho da o y luego le venci en su
5204572 rafa est incre ble jugando muy bien y con una gran confianza se lo merece totalmente
5204573 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5204574 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad
5204575 we also recently signed the council of europes convention on the protection of children from sexual exploitation and abuse which sets standards to ensure that countries criminalise the sexual exploitation and abuse of children and adopt similar standards of investigation
5204576 we will also take any further action that is necessary and believe these changes that we have made will see the number of sex offenders prosecuted increase
5204577 its important he comes back to uk and that hes managed because we know how high risk he is and the risk he will just go to other countries and slip off the radar again we cant take that risk he needs to be managed and monitored and supervised
5204578 this is my last match i wanted to take the title so i consider my beijing trip a totally failure
5204579 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
5204580 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medallist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
5204581 it appears that she has restored a youthful look with a combination of injectables
5204582 no matter what happens there will be a change from what weve had for the last eight years

5204592 yeah its a little weird after all not as weird as we thought but weird lets stay an hour or so then say thanks and split
5204593 obviously my swing was there this week and my putter but there wasnt really a tee shot i didnt like
5204594 usually you have two three shots i never felt awkward with any tee shots or anything like that it set up great for me
5204595 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off
5204596 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me
5204597 i kind of felt like i let the tournament slip away on 10 and 11
5204598 i told myself on the next tee box i got my momentum
5204599 finally feel like you got one back on that hole
5204600 obviously my swing was there this week and my putter but there wasnt really a tee shot i didnt like
5204601 usually you have two three shots i never felt awkward with any tee shots or anything like that it set up great for me

5204605 i told myself on the next tee box i got my momentum
5204606 finally feel like you got one back on that hole
5204607 it will be a great satisfaction just to think about you know pulled it off and did it and its a wonderful feeling
5204608 doesnt happen that often in golf unless youre tiger woods
5204609 i thought what can i do to make my babies proud i think about what theyll think about the year they were born who i was and what i did
5204610 working out and getting back into shape isnt exciting to me but training for a triathlon is theres a goal at the end of it something to reach for

5204655 as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible

5204690 the purpose of the calendar is to showcase their bravery and to show theyre not a bunch of pretty boys standing in front of the statue of liberty
5204691 the firemen used the jaws of life to cut me out of the wreckage
5204692 i remember just screaming my head off and i was in the worst pain in the world the fireman came into the car and he had the most blue serene eyes i remember just quieting down and he talked me through it if it wasnt for them being able to pull me out of the wreck there could have been a lot more damage im able to walk
5204693 no one should underestimate them on paper or whatever people think they might look like a weaker side than argentina or brazil but its not by luck that people get into the semifinals so its going to be a tough game
5204694 i cant see much speed in their game but belgians are known for being very good without the ball so they are playing good pressing in the middle and i saw that they can pass the ball very well but i have confidence in my boys that we can play compact and concentrate and will not let them play easily
5204695 i am here to service these guys and give him an opportunity to rest up its a good opportunity for me to go there and get game film hopefully someone else sees it
5204696 they did what they had to do there are no hard feelings in that regard
5204697 it was a good experience to be there a week
5204698 i would have liked to have stayed longer and been on the active roster because i would have gotten some game film but it didnt work out that way
5204699 i have been living at home in columbus ohio working out and actually caddying at muirfield waiting for a call so i could get an opportunity
5204700 mentally you have to put the misses out of your mind
5204701 you cant over think it and go home and beat yourself up you have to work hard and make sure you are in physical shape and make sure you are swinging right nice and easy just like golf
5204702 i have been trying for a while and ive said if i dont get something out of this year then i am done
5204703 its not a situation where i am nervous ill just go out there and have fun thats what you have to do
5204704 we are not afraid of them and they are not afraid of us at the end we will know who will continue to the final and who was the best team
5204705 messi is a key player here and he is very important to us
5204706 its always tough against argentina no matter what has happened so far
5204707 its going to be a tight match everyone will have to be very cautious
5204708 thats a great feeling you walk out there and its a great place to play here in tennessee the fans are awesome its loud its a great football atmosphere so its an amazing feeling
5204709 it doesnt sound like a lot but the opposite spin on the ball makes you think about it a little bit once i got used to it its great he gets the ball back 15 yards to me in about 6 seconds which gives me more time to do what ive got to do before i kick it
5204710 hes been great for me hes had a couple bad snaps in a game nothing thats ever hurt us hes very reliable and the only thing thats happened the last couple years is hes gotten hurt a couple times thats obviously not his fault he comes back from them strong
5204711 i thought i can do that at least i thought so but at that point i had moved on with my life i had a full time job it was just kind of a blessing when it all did happen
5204712 hes athletic and hes made some goal line stops for us played short yardage for us played linebacker in the preseason for us hes a snapper that can do more than just snap he can go down and make the tackle he wants to play on all four special teams or six rather we cant risk that
5204713 no one should underestimate them on paper or whatever people think they might look like a weaker side than argentina or brazil but its not by luck that people get into the semifinals so its going to be a tough game
5204714 i cant see much speed in their game but belgians are known for being very good without the ball so they are playing good pressing in the middle and i saw that they can pass the ball very well but i have confidence in my boys that we can play compact and concentrate and will not let them play easily
5204715 the most important thing was the fact that we were able to do a lot better than we did the previous week
5204716 as an offense you always want to see yourself making strides
5204717 im just trying to stay modest and just remember that its still a very long season and i dont want to look at things more than what they are right now its still early
5204718 hes a tremendous teammate hes a big effort guy and he showed it
5204719 robs obviously a big physical receiver that we need to get in those situations thats the way we score points in the red zone is with a guy like that
5204720 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5204721 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
5204722 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable
5204723 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
5204724 we always have to try to strike a balance between public access and security for the building and for the people there
5204725 we intend to charge them to the fullest extent of the law
5204726 will likely also carry more risk than acknowledged by pbgcs analysis
5204727 any investment strategy that allocates significant portions of the portfolio to volatile or illiquid assets
5204728 there is no doubt that this has been an enormous fall from grace for a man that lived 61 years in an exemplary fashion
5204729 the facts in this case are very serious indeed unbelievable for a male with no prior convictions to set out and deliberately have sex with an underage female
5204730 it is never a childs fault when they are the victim of a crime
5204731 it was clearly within your contemplation that she was underage
5204732 costs for labor materials and supplies and other operating expenses continue to rise
5204733 a reduction in use per customer as a result of conservation more efficient appliances more energy efficient building construction and other factors that negatively affect the companys revenues
5204734 increased customer usage the benefit of rate increases and reduced operating expenses
5204735 this must be what it felt like to be at the party rally in nuremberg
5204736 de manh tem sido barulhento aqui n o sei se por ter bastante crian a e isso acaba confundindo porque na hora da largada est todo mundo concentrado esperando o estalo da pistola para arrancar
5204737 acabei saindo depois dos outros quando normalmente a largada meu forte sempre deixo uns dois ou tr s para tr s mas foi bom que eu n o gastei muita energia agora descansar para voltar aqui noite
5204738 ele est dois tr s n veis acima de todo mundo est acima da humanidade literalmente passeando e os outros brigando pela medalha de prata

5204746 geb udereinigungsfirmen und krankenhausleitungen m ssen gemeinsam daf r sorge tragen dass ihre besch ftigten umfassend ber risiken und schutzma nahmen informiert werden dabei muss den reinigungskr ften auch deutlich empfohlen werden sich beispielsweise gegen hepatitis a und b impfen zu lassen
5204747 wischen ist nicht gleich wischen eine intensivstation muss anders gereinigt werden als ein treppenhaus
5204748 compared how many people reside in our service community with how many library materials our community borrows the survey results are the equivalent of every man woman and child in the orrville city school district checking out 39 9 books from the library
5204749 orrville public library has been a standout for years in national ratings of libraries serving smaller communities populations of between 10 000 and 25 000
5204750 the difference in this ranking is that orrville is being compared to libraries across the country that are much bigger much more wealthy some libraries have budgets exceeding 20 million orrville public library still comes out on top
5204751 orrville can always be proud of our wonderful library and excellent staff that makes good things happen for a library our size this is truly an amazing accomplishment
5204752 somebody doing something to hurt somebody else and they do it repeatedly
5204753 the message was if everybody gets together its the kids themselves who can stop it more than teachers more than anybody else
5204754 to do their best in school and seek to put positive things in their lives
5204755 i told doug make sure you ask them how they feel
5204756 we made doors for each room and put in plants for the environment
5204757 i liked the teams and teachers and i really enjoyed band
5204758 making new friends getting to class on time getting my locker open
5204759 they help teach you what not to do drink smoke bully people or misbehave
5204760 we took this hoping we would have it until retirement
5204761 this is where we want to live out our childrens youth
5204762 rick is also a fireman so he wants to stay in this district
5204763 even the different things you can feed horses surprised me
5204764 everyone helps everyone here it is like a big family
5204765 i love watching sports ive been watching the olympics all week
5204766 whatever they want to do or be it will be their choice
5204767 im not taking anything away from phelps incredible accomplishments here but please mind the chronological snobbery phelps accomplishments while highly laudable were evolutionary rather than revolutionary
5204768 este o tendinta regionala pe fondul usoarei reveniri a raportului euro dolar leul se apreciaza insa cel mai puternic dintre toate monedele emergente fiind probabil sustinut de dobanzile mari din piata monetara
5204769 jucatorii se uita la evolutia evenimentelor in georgia insa ce conteaza in primul rand este evolutia raportului euro dolar aprecierea dolarului va influenta cel mai mult evolutia monedelor emergente
5204770 tinta este sa ne apropiem de pozitia a saptea ca putere economica in uniunea europeana estimam ca pib ul va creste de la 135 miliarde euro cat este in prezent la 220 miliarde euro
5204771 de asemenea in 2012 pib ul pe cap de locuitor va fi 10 000 euro in echivalentul banilor de astazi salariul mediu brut lunar va fi de 3 000 lei iar pensia medie de 1 250 1 300 lei
5204772 estimarile noastre sunt ca investitiile straine in perioada 2009 2012 vor fi de 30 40 miliarde euro iar investitiile din buget de 30 miliarde euro la care se adauga 25 miliarde euro din fonduri europene
5204773 talvez mais do que est ticamente sens veis ou politicamente corretos o que n s devemos mesmo ser ativamente bons

5204777 n s n o sabemos sobre o sorteio nos falaram que isso a que pode haver confronto contra time do mesmo grupo est vamos preocupados em ganhar aqui da alemanha e depois ir atr s disso estou procurando os respons veis t cnicos para saber como vai funcionar
5204778 estados unidos e it lia s o os que mais conhecem o brasil e souberam jogar contra n s ao longo destes oito anos mas o que vier tem que estar preparado para enfrentar
5204779 no primeiro set quando perd amos por 9 12 olhei para bandeira nacional da ge rgia isso me deu for as
5204780 muita gente me contou como era participar dos jogos ol mpicos mas quando se est aqui vivendo isto se conhece essa realidade estou tendo muitas li es em cada partida que jogo
5204781 ele est muito triste preferiu ficar no quarto n o quis nem sair para dar uma volta
5204782 convencemos ele a dar um passeio aqui dentro da vila para espairecer
5204783 we wanted a venue where it wasnt just another meeting or a place where people had to be where their families were not with them
5204784 everything were doing is about families self sufficiency health education theres nothing healthier than spending fun time together
5204785 we always try to make it someplace thats going to be interesting for people to see that they dont normally get to go to one of my favorite parts of my job is going behind the scenes and seeing what these companies do other people feel the same way
5204786 it seemed like a good combination of affordable family fun and education about united way and our partner agencies
5204787 i hope people walk away learning something about united way and about the programs that are supported by united way dollars
5204788 you cant entertain a family of four for 10 that was like a huge bonus for us
5204789 i dont know about us being the best in the area but well definitely be better than last year
5204790 we all worked hard in the offseason weve grown closer as a team and hopefully that helps us in the ohio cardinal conference sectionals the ashland invitational wherever we go
5204791 i actually played with murphy at group lessons and things like that when we were younger
5204792 we hadnt kept in touch but i was excited when i heard she was coming she makes us a lot deeper
5204793 ive been in ballet with murphy for a long time
5204794 i think she will grow into that no 1 singles spot shell help us a lot
5204795 i played a lot of people who were a lot better than me i do feel like it helped my game improve though
5204796 my center focus for ballet helps me with my center focus for tennis especially with singles
5204797 basically that means my concentration has to be good if im down or make a mistake i cant lose focus
5204798 people do tell me they definitely can tell im a dancer especially when i run
5204799 its probably the biggest number weve had at least since ive been here
5204800 its good to see a lot of new girls especially a lot of freshman theyll get older and well have a strong team in the future
5204801 there have been a few times the last few years when anger has been a problem for me but now im playing relaxed
5204802 one year i had to sit out a tournament or two and i really learned from it
5204803 i know now that theres nothing you can do but keep playing
5204804 my putting has gotten a lot better the last few years
5204805 i think its just from maturing and when you play the same courses year after year you get to know them and what to do
5204806 he doesnt have to overpower a golf course and sometimes he gets in trouble trying to do that
5204807 the other day he tried to hit a drive over some trees going for an eagle and ended up with a double bogey you want him to have that confidence but theres kind of a fine line with what to do in terms of course management its the difference between a 75 and an 81
5204808 he does have the ability though he hits the ball is a good putter hes got all the shots
5204809 i can have him as my caddy when hes on my bag i play 10 times better
5204810 every year the goal as a team is to make it through each stage sectionals and distircts to make it to state and id also like to win the ohio cardinal conference we havent done that since my freshman year
5204811 i want to win a few tournaments too and if the team doesnt make it to state id like to make it as an individual
5204812 the district is at pine hills and i hate that course so if i can make it out of there that would be amazing
5204813 wir sind eine mannschaft mit wenigen stars und einem starken willen
5204814 da bei uns die mannschaftsleistung im vordergrund steht konnten wir die ruhe bewahren und uns sogar noch steigern als wir in r ckstand geraten sind und mit einem mann weniger auskommen mussten
5204815 zun chst einmal sind wir auf dem platz wie br der jeder arbeitet f r seine kameraden
5204816 au erdem ziehen wir uns nie in die defensive zur ck wir haben in diesem turnier schon unter beweis gestellt dass wir angreifen k nnen selbst nachdem wir gegen die italiener mit einem tor hinten lagen haben wir konstant druck gemacht und sie nicht zur ruhe kommen lassen
5204817 es wird sicher nicht einfach werden aber wir haben italien im letzten spiel besiegt und werden immer selbstbewusster nigeria mag zwar gut sein aber wir sind ein team an dem man nicht so schnell vorbeikommt
5204818 we are still finalising with the round 7 funding applying for fresh grants would have been illogical however we shall apply for round 9 funding

5204820 there has not been that push for prevention as theres been for treatment
5204821 if we thought the first phase was hard we have to prepare for even tougher times
5204822 increasing awareness that treatment is prevention both for individuals and populations
5204823 the degree to which the drugs can prevent infections has proved highly contentious
5204824 it just doesnt seem like a cautious public health recommendation
5204825 i dont think anyones shown the threshold below which people cannot transmit
5204826 rather than arguing for a single magic bullet we really need to be trying to focus everything that we can on what works to realize these natural synergies
5204827 we are trying to work on an insurance policy that will provide a package of services we want to include even healthy people and families of those with hiv
5204828 scheme for only hiv positive people would mean higher premiums
5204829 milestone in the fight against the discrimination of people living with hiv
5204830 this health insurance will allow us to get the best possible treatment and change the perception that we are a financial burden on our families
5204831 first step to breaking down financial barriers of hiv positive people in accessing treatment
5204832 if we really want to prevent hiv from spreading perhaps the first thing we need to let people know is hiv aids is not limited to any specific group of people
5204833 is not an endemic restricted to sex workers or drug users only
5204834 when it comes to hiv aids it is more than just a disease the social harassment and stigmatization to hiv positive people persist because weve still not been able to accept that were not an exception either
5204835 these drugs will allow hiv positive mothers to safely breastfeed without any worry about infecting their children

5204837 the hummer is way too expensive for the chinese military and demand from civilian buyers is not big enough to justify a purchase especially with oil prices running near an all time high
5204838 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5204839 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5204840 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5204841 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5204842 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5204843 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5204844 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5204845 look i just want to let you know you cant do nothing with the church
5204846 my mother said remember youre still kevin and youre going to make sure everybody remembers who kevin is
5204847 she used to say ill be your greatest critic and your greatest adviser because no one likes you like your mother she was a phenomenal force and influence in our lives
5204848 she was as protective as a lioness but she had a soft heart when it came to people with issues problems tragedy or illness
5204849 her entire life she always made sure that others were taken care of

5204855 its way too early to know which if any of these technologies is going to be practical
5204856 but its important for us to get ahead of the curve soldiers are always on the cutting edge of new technologies
5204857 in situations where it is important to win the hearts and minds of the local populace it would be useful to know if they understand the information being given them
5204858 its also important to develop antidotes and protective agents against various classes of drugs
5204859 how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
5204860 i think most reasonable people if they imagine a world in which all sides have figured out how to control brains theyd rather not go there
5204861 most rational human beings would believe that if we could have a world where nobody does military neuroscience well all be better off but for some people in the pentagon its too delicious to ignore
5204862 high performance computing chess the life sciences pringles and the singularity
5204863 i think it will become obvious that this technology has the ability to help with some of the research being done at unmc
5204864 i plan to describe how high performance computers have helped shape other developments
5204865 i think it will become obvious that this technology has the ability to help with some of the research being done at unmc
5204866 i plan to discuss in general terms the role high performance computing has had in other areas of research and also its potential role in biomedical research
5204867 the impact of high performance computing in the life science is growing rapidly
5204868 with the net we send everything from our central import point and save thousands weekly
5204869 in the case of our online gaming marketing venture we initially started out with a simple website and then slowly grew as sales increased
5204870 then the website expanded into a data warehouse essentially a store of all things related to our marketing campaigns which allowed us to study and refine subsequent efforts
5204871 if you walk up to someone and say ive got a great online gaming business idea would you contribute 100k theyll probably laugh and consider you a lunatic but if you approach someone and say look i have this great idea and my plan is the following it will reassure an anxious investor that things will move forward with thought and purpose
5204872 many online gaming companies go pel mel spending money when there is a good cash flow while there is nothing wrong with wanting to expand it has to be done in accordance with accounting standards and detailed record keeping this is especially true for public companies private online gaming firms can sometimes let this aspect of the business slide alittle
5204873 starting up any online gaming business is difficult in our case it took about 6 months of planning a year of fund raising and then another 6 months of building infrastructure before we made our first sale
5204874 with the net we send everything from our central import point and save thousands weekly
5204875 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
5204876 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
5204877 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results
5204878 were hoping to try our new spatial studies this spring with
5204879 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements
5204880 in the short term we expect prices to remain high relative to historical levels albeit with higher volatility
5204881 the continuing massive industrialisation in china is providing solid support to the global economy
5204882 we have achieved another year of record earnings driven by excellent operating performance cost control and the delivery of high margin growth projects into strong market conditions
5204883 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5204884 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5204885 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5204886 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5204887 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5204888 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5204889 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5204890 hes in this high office in rome now and im really happy for him
5204891 its a big deal for the catholic community here and i want to see what he has to say
5204892 im happy hell serve the church in a wonderful new way
5204893 but ill miss his support his leadership and his friendship
5204894 to see that what i did in terms of discipline in situations to see it in a context of pastoral charity really of pastoral love
5204895 i want them to see the challenge that the church faces in our society which has so many agendas and ideas which are really quite hostile to the catholic faith
5204896 i think sometimes were so caught up in the culture in which we live with this kind of political correctness that we expect our priests and bishops to act that way and if they do then were in troubled times
5204897 holding the hard line which a lot of catholics needed
5204898 im proud to be identified with the blessed years ive spent as your archbishop i love you all
5204899 i will never cease to pray for you please do not forget me in your prayers
5204900 we focus on the chains because a lot of people eat there
5204901 and from a practical standpoint they all have standardized recipes and menus
5204902 we want the customers to have the information its just a challenge to present it so its of value to the guest
5204903 if you have a sandwich and you have your choice of hash browns onion rings french fries or fresh fruit theres a range of calories how do you present that so customers arent reading a book
5204904 one of our priorities is that customers have all the information they need
5204905 the posters the pamphlets the kiosks the restaurants know people wont see it
5204906 they seem willing to supply nutrition information except in ways that work
5204907 it becomes difficult for the operator to comply and it becomes extremely confusing for the consumer
5204908 the idea that everybody knows whats good for them and you dont need this information is just not true
5204909 as the industry moves forward and people are more and more health conscious i believe consumers are going to start expecting that
5204910 any made to order type place is going to have an impossible time
5204911 i look at labels in the grocery store all the time
5204912 i look at it and say thats too high in fat you cant have that

5204915 we need bottom up real solutions so kids in st louis and kansas city have a level playing field
5204916 her agenda is really where we need to be focusing
5204917 this is my fifth year as president in st louis and were getting ready to have our seventh superintendent
5204918 if nothing else we need some stability in the district at the top
5204919 it was so revealing in how far weve come that she could stand on equal footing with any of them
5204920 she is so strong and fighting hard i know that the lord is with her at every moment and i know that she knows the lord is right by her side
5204921 the charge was based on reivichs refusal to tell either school authorities or the house committee on un american activities whether or not he had ever engaged in communist activities
5204922 walter biddle saul the boards president voted against this dismissal
5204923 as he did in the case of the six teachers previously discharged on the ground that the evidence was insufficient
5204924 a friend of his of about 60 years said for him mr reivich there was only one basis for decision what was honorable honest and beneficial for the larger community
5204925 a very close knit group of friends a huge support system
5204926 it was important for kids to study about the civil rights movement
5204927 thats what he loved and did so well he was a wonderful teacher

5204959 if the israelis dont resolve the palestinian prisoners issue soon and contemplate attacking gaza the palestinian resistance is prepared to not only defend the strip but also take the initiative and capture more soldiers who will never see the light of day unless a prisoner exchange deal is signed
5204960 bringing about the release of the captive israeli army soldier and prevent the capture of additional israeli troops
5204961 but they will be carried out should the ceasefire be violated and in case no solution is found to the issue of the palestinian prisoners within the framework of a prisoner swap with israel
5204962 not resting but rather training and preparing for the day israel violates the truce and attacks gaza
5204963 why are the israelis permitted to arm themselves and train and we arent
5204964 we will continue with our jihad and warn that if israel attacks the strip will become a graveyard for israeli soldiers

5204978 which will be open to all students with a b or better overall average well be competing against all other district schools both public and private to expose our scholar athletes to the best competition in the area
5204979 this aspect of our curriculum will really prepare students for the real world

5204981 weve worked hard for almost five years now planning organizing and developing what we think will be the nations best casino computer programmer volunteers learning center the next obvious step was to build it and get students through the doors which will not be any trouble whatsoever
5204982 it will be the best in the nation and will prepare all beulah ordeneaux county youth for the challenges of tomorrow
5204983 were going to finance this the easy way and tax payers will barely notice any changes in their bills
5204984 im thrilled that my son will have the opportunity to attend this school which really looks promising when i graduated from the winger mcalphin private school i was really clueless about the real world this casino computer programmer volunteers school looks much different it is the real world and promises to teach our kids how to be productive citizens no matter what career path they may follow
5204985 were excited to announce ground breaking on our citys newest project a casino computer programmer volunteers school for talented students to foster careers and livelihoods
5204986 once construction begins we estimate a two year completion time
5204987 we desparately needed facilities for all our programs and the high school was running out of space now with this casino computer programmer volunteers school getting built and fields set to be operational next spring we will have plenty of space for people to recreate and enjoy team sports

5204990 for women over 40 receiving a mammogram should be equal across income education racial and geographical levels
5204991 our study discovered rural african american and native american women were less likely to receive the screening
5204992 the results indicate a greater need to educate women particularly with culturally sensitive messages about the importance of these screenings
5204993 it also is imperative that we work with health professionals to provide culturally competent care
5204994 the results indicate a greater need to educate women particularly with culturally sensitive messages about the importance of these screenings
5204995 this program has had a tremendous impact on the lives of women
5204996 of course we can always do more to educate women on the importance of these screenings we continue to evaluate the program looking for ways to serve women better
5204997 wed like to thank the scotts for their deep concern for the health of nebraskans and their support of our efforts

5205004 for someone as religious as she was there is an eerie sense of comfort in that
5205005 there is comfort in knowing she died on the assumption and she died peacefully
5205006 our determination to fight for what we believe in comes from her
5205007 dad was kind of a laid back guy but mom didnt hesitate to pick up the phone and give us her opinion about our lives and careers
5205008 it was mom she wanted to know what i was doing i didnt even know she had the number of my car phone she said you cant disagree with the archdiocese
5205009 i hope weve accomplished a lot of what she expected of us
5205010 and we will continue to do what she expected she used to say youre only as good as what you leave behind
5205011 whatever we had oatmeal cold cereal eggs there were always those powdered rolls from the bakery
5205012 that was one of the defining moments of my life that they shared that special moment with me
5205013 she wanted to make sure people were fed and clothed
5205014 she also provided food for elderly people living in the neighborhood when she was living at the shore she would take platters of food to a neighbor
5205015 she instilled in us the desire to fight for the underdog she believed that all people are equal and should be treated with respect and dignity
5205016 she was the epitome of what a mother is supposed to be
5205017 we used to say she brought more gifts than santa claus
5205018 my friends said every time they saw her she was fashionably appropriate for her age you would never catch her in sneakers and a sweatshirt
5205019 she started her family life with her husband and he was with her when she died

5205021 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5205022 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5205023 londoners have so far been largely insulated from the price falls taking place elsewhere in the country
5205024 however sellers who choose to come to the market during the peak holiday season generally have a greater need to sell and as a result properties coming onto the market in july were on average 21 000 cheaper than last month
5205025 when looking at trends in the market it is important to remember that uk house prices are significantly higher than five years ago
5205026 the current issue affecting the market is largely about the supply of credit a very different situation to the early 1990s which was about high interest rates and unemployment
5205027 the fundamentals underpinning the market remain sound with long term demand for housing low interest rates and low unemployment

5205035 all of us who were in the theater who were involved with the festival cheered and applauded and everyone else kind of wondered why
5205036 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning

5205039 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as
5205040 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5205041 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
5205042 said jennifer cheavens assistant professor of psychology at ohio state university
5205043 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5205044 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
5205045 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
5205046 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
5205047 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
5205048 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
5205049 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful

5205052 americans regard democracy as something more transcendent something more sacred than just counting noses
5205053 americans at base want to know that their politics is about what is right and if a majority wants to do what is wrong people just dont roll over
5205054 just that very basic principle of recognizing the humanity of blacks was huge
5205055 i could say i train on that kind of thing for half an hour every day but only an idiot would shoot from there
5205056 it was a great ball to find me and my first touch wasnt that good i tried to hit it between the goalkeeper and the defence but accidentally it went where it wasnt supposed to go
5205057 its important to get goals from other areas the manager is right
5205058 he probably didnt expect it to come from there but last season the defence didnt get many at all
5205059 i had a few chances much easier than that last season but they didnt go in so if i can get a couple this season then brilliant as long as the team gets three points thats the important thing
5205060 this pre season was one of the hardest things i have ever been through and i have been through some crazy stuff
5205061 its good to hit the ground running but now its more important to keep it going to see what we can get out of this first 10 games
5205062 it was hard to come in during the winter last season but i was well prepared in holland to come to the english premier league i was focused
5205063 every game is hard here it doesnt matter how you are physically or mentally it is tough to play here
5205064 i have been following the team for a while and have seen most of the games they played i knew their style and what they wanted now im trying to deliver
5205065 its a fantastic start theres no doubt but it is only a start
5205066 its only two league games and one cup game theres an awful long way to go
5205067 the manager and i looked at the areas for strength and development right across the football club
5205068 we locked ourselves in the hotels on away days and talked nothing but bolton
5205069 we compiled a formal document and discussed it with the chairman and members of the board and we were delighted that we were given the support to implement what we had recommended
5205070 during the summer neither myself nor the manager went away it was day in day out stuff in my opinion no one will have worked harder than the staff at bolton
5205071 i had the opportunity to work with a number of other clubs but i graduated with gary three years ago at warwick university doing the uefa pro licence and always kept in touch with him
5205072 we kept in touch and when he called to ask whether i would be his assistant manager i was absolutely delighted
5205073 for the younger players obviously the result matters but for the older ones whether they are coming back from injury or fighting for a place in the first team it is about the performance
5205074 it was great to beat city because it was our first competitive game but its the improvement in the players im interested in

5205097 wir verfolgen die strategie m glichst weite bereiche unserer prozesse zu automatisieren und zu industrialisieren

5205099 dabei stellte sich heraus dass etwa ein drittel der aktuell eingesetzten systeme noch nicht linux f hig ist
5205100 weil diese plattform zu erheblichen abschreibungskosten f hrte hat t systems ein dynamisches verbrauchsbezogenes hosting konzept entwickelt auf das wir nach ablauf des abschreibungszeitraums der zuvor eingesetzten unix umgebung gewechselt sind
5205101 die rechenleistung unter linux erm glicht es uns die prozessschritte des forderungsmanagements zwischen 20 und 40 prozent schneller zu verarbeiten
5205102 f r unsere 5000 concurrent sap user erzielen wir durchschnittliche antwortzeiten von etwas mehr als zwei sekunden

5205112 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5205113 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5205114 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5205115 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5205124 i really feel like im the luckiest person on the planet having been schooled under coaches i respect more than anyone on the planet
5205125 i have a coaching staff that has such amazing experience and they really allow me to have the confidence to do the things i have to
5205126 dave has been here 37 years and he has seen so much
5205127 he thankfully decided to come back this year to school a 28 year old coach about how to handle the duties of a head coach having him around makes the transition so easy and i dont know what id do without him
5205128 it was such an amazing feeling to coach against warren jfk
5205129 watching a team that youve helped put together and get in the right positions go out there and execute your game plan is something really special i cant take the credit as it all goes to my players and coaches but its a great feeling

5205136 ubuntu is fast becoming the new star of linux as demonstrated by the findings of alfrescos most recent open source barometer accounting for nearly a quarter of all linux os rollouts as of january 2008 ubuntu was also the fastest growing linux distribution over the second half of 2007 with the backing of a professional organization such as canonical were delighted to be driving the growing trend towards easy to install and easy to manage open source products
5205137 were excited to work with alfresco on delivering an enterprise class content management system for ubuntu users for which this is the first step users have a great opportunity to assess alfresco on ubuntu and see the benefits these two great open source solutions can bring organizations we will jointly deliver a pre packaged enterprise version of alfresco later in the year
5205138 since we first announced general availability of zimbra for ubuntu last year we have seen incredible adoption within the ubuntu community
5205139 we are eager to offer our world class collaboration experience yahoo zimbra desktop to the vibrant community of ubuntu users worldwide
5205140 this was my first ever adventure with a slakware based gnu linux distribution so i cannot say it has been an easy effortless task but thats probably just my lack of experience because after i finished the installation and testing of zenwalk 5 2 beta gnome edition it all made much more sense still i would have greatly appreciated a more intuitive installer which could guide through the steps to a trouble free installation accompanied with slightly more detailed explanations especially at the partitioning stage and now lets have a closer look at what this edition of zenwalk brings to the new linux user
5205141 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5205142 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5205143 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5205144 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5205145 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5205146 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5205147 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5205148 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5205149 developing an alternative method of administering vaccine therapy that is well tolerated by most patients and produces similar immune responses to standard methods may help further the development of vaccine therapies for prostate cancer
5205150 based on safety and feasibility metronomic dosing appears to be superior to standard dosing and administration
5205151 more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this dosing method in treating prostate cancer

5205158 we know the safety of all workers has always been paramount for all the construction companies contracted to build the 10 world cup stadiums the incident in polokwane today highlights however the dangers associated with constructing these world class stadia under very difficult conditions
5205159 there are over 20 000 workers on site daily at all 10 fifa world cup stadia
5205160 every one of the thousands of men and women working day and night on the world cup construction sites are the real heroes of this project and we would like to salute all of them as we mourn the tragic passing of the worker in polokwane today

5205172 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5205173 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5205174 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5205175 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5205176 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5205177 you set the standard so high and you lose one series and ask whats wrong
5205178 thats what were saying weve been riding the wave so long we have to get another wave
5205179 jeremy would start and i would finish i told him during the anthem im going to come in and save it for you
5205180 but if he doesnt pitch like he did we dont have the chance to win he did a great job
5205181 you talk about the definition of a save and thats it
5205182 lewis showed a lot of moxie out there we were playing no doubles on defense so that first ball drops in jensen had to bow his neck and thats what he did
5205183 hes a big playmaker and i try to stay more consistent and be in the right place at the right time
5205184 our styles are different but i think they mesh well
5205185 theyre young energetic motivated driven guys and thats sometimes better than anything you can have
5205186 i remember my first year starting i couldve ran through a brick wall i thought i was so energetic i was so ready to go every day and im looking forward to that energy all year long thats going to get me going
5205187 id be really disappointed if our defensive line doesnt do well
5205188 its tough to play 12 games and 80 plays a game
5205189 i think its a good thing that were able to keep that motor going the whole game thats something we pride ourselves on running to the ball and if we can get a series off here and there its fine with me as long as im going to be playing at a high level all the time
5205190 thats something ive always said the journey is more important than the destination
5205191 thats true whether you win a gold medal or whether you get eighth place
5205192 just coming to the olympic games has been a great experience and theres so much i can take away from this
5205193 first round i was a little scared i was tense
5205194 tonight i felt great i went all out i gave it everything i had it didnt happen quite the way i wouldve liked it to but i have no regrets
5205195 i was like oh my gosh im in the finals at the olympic games
5205196 in rome i mean that would be a great place to visit
5205197 up to 2 4 percent of the u s population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as biracial
5205198 we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding the social psychological and experiential differences that may increase the likelihood of psychological disorders among this fast growing segment of the population
5205199 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5205200 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5205201 whether its his last game or not this week well wait and see because with the amount of injuries weve got he will probably be forced to play against geelong
5205202 this game against the hawks was more than likely going to be it but the way were going with injuries more than likely hell have to front up against geelong
5205203 it was always tentative with everything that was said about his last game even this week so hes happy to continue on and see the year out

5205210 we may see a cut in the personal income tax rate additional tax relief adjusting the brackets for personal income tax and lowering employees contribution rate to the pension fund epf on a temporary basis among others to ease economic hardship among the lower and middle income groups
5205211 we just kept the faith we prepared for it hoped for it and were ready to take advantage of it
5205212 its been a lifelong dream to wrestle in the olympic games
5205213 teammates are walking around with olympic shoes olympic jackets olympic gear went through opening ceremonies and all that

5205218 look russia ive already told you once and i am not going to tell you again pull out of georgia or else im serious stop bloody laughing at me why you dont make me come down there
5205219 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5205220 violation of the peace agreement and a challenge to progress in mindanao
5205221 because of these sneaky attacks as commander in chief i have ordered the afp and pnp to defend every inch of philippine territory against milf forces and immediately restore peace in affected areas in lanao del norte
5205222 not tolerate and would not crush any attempt to disturb the peace and development in mindanao
5205223 to assess the situation in lanao and other areas in mindanao and come up with concrete firm and decisive action
5205224 i assure our people that the government will defend them at all cost from any move that will disrupt the aspiration for genuine and lasting peace
5205225 legal guardians of the lesser life forms and as stewards of gods creations
5205226 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5205227 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me
5205228 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan
5205229 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah
5205230 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5205231 the armed forces of the philippines should undertake punitive action against the milf forces involved and uphold the rule of law we cannot afford renewed armed hostilities because this will only set back efforts to bring economic and social progress to muslim mindanao
5205232 these acts of criminality and terrorism by rebel muslim groups should be dealt with quickly and met frontally with the full force of the law
5205233 the government and our armed forces cannot afford now to deal with kids gloves with this kind of situation
5205234 we want peace but when terrorism is the result of peace negotiations the terrorists must be stopped and subdued at all cost
5205235 the rampage being done by the milf group clearly shows criminal terrorism by any definition its time to throw the statute books and enforce our laws on terrorism there is no other way to deal with this situation
5205236 we condemn the death injury hostage taking and displacement of innocent civilians the safety and security of their lives and property must not be risked at any cost we therefore call for ceasefire and resumption of peace talks
5205237 if it upholds the primacy of the peace process the government must calibrate its responses to milf initiated attacks otherwise it would violate the ceasefire agreement
5205238 with another war in their midst many of our brothers and sisters in mindanao particularly in lanao del sur and lanao del norte fear for the safety of their loved ones immediate resolution and a return to normalcy is urged the soonest time possible
5205239 lets keep in mind that peace and prosperity in mindanao will eventually result in the welfare stability and security of the entire philippines
5205240 evacuation procedures should be carried out in orderly fashion innocent civilians should not be caught in the crossfire between the military and forces of the milf massive relief must be done now
5205241 we really have to know first from the milf leaders if they are still in control those who are out of line should be relieved from their posts and should be punished by the milf leadership for breaking the chain of command
5205242 dit was onze laatste kans op een zege op de spelen
5205243 het is de realiteit dat we dit niveau van werpen verdedigen en slaan niet in nederland zien
5205244 opt local share man usr share man usr x11r6 man man
5205245 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5205246 he should tender his resignation pack up his bags and go
5205247 whatever little moral authority was left has now been completely eroded
5205248 this thing must be clear to everyone that president musharraf is not going to resign period
5205249 this is an issue that is not on the table
5205250 we want stability in the country we want political stability
5205251 the cameras and microphones will soon disappear and we will have to depend on our own voices to be heard our voices will be as loud as the blast
5205252 i am disappointed that i have learned the hard way that you cant count on safety nets political answers will not be accepted we deserve the truth
5205253 once we have an environmental inspector we will know if there are any long term health affects and only a real estate appraiser can tell the size of the area affected
5205254 all my parents windows shattered and they were in a panic
5205255 i have safety concerns for my family and im not sure the city and province have a plan they are just reacting
5205256 you take it for granted its been there so long
5205257 then something explodes and you remember just how close you are to those tanks everyday
5205258 we take safety very seriously and the terminal undergoes rigorous and regular evaluations and safety audits both internally and by the tssa technical standards and safety authority
5205259 we need to make sure we take care of the residents and do all that we can to alleviate the stress and concerns
5205260 the province cannot get in the way of what is in the citys interest to ensure that we can regulate and control the zoning of facilities that may want to locate in residential areas in the future
5205261 because public confidence is very important to our industry we work hard to maintain it and one of the best ways to do that is to ensure proper risk management
5205262 but it is also entirely possible that theyve already taken these sorts of things into consideration in the current policy
5205263 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed
5205264 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for
5205265 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5205266 i want mothers to listen to their instincts and thats not something i did
5205267 child care in the u s is not typically regarded as a societal responsibility
5205268 parents are out there on their own pressured to make a good decision about selecting child care but they often dont know where to access good information or what to look for
5205269 in regulated care licensed or certified we have individuals investigating complaints
5205270 in an unregulated setting no one really has jurisdiction if someone complains that their child is not being cared for properly
5205271 if we had asked to see where the children slept we would have noticed that there were no baby monitors in the room and that would have been a huge red flag
5205272 she did what she had to do to support her family i understood that
5205273 all of us parents knew what she was doing and if we had a problem with it we didnt have to stay
5205274 that was my biggest mistake i didnt trust my instincts we decided to give kaltenberg a second chance
5205275 ms kaltenberg has sentenced me to a life without my daughter a life i dont want to live and which isnt worth living
5205276 factors may cause the data to become less clear for example everyone uses different types of computers and monitors we cant be sure they have understood the instructions properly and we have no idea who is actually doing the experiments
5205277 there is no real evidence that it measures attitudes much less prejudices in fact its not at all clear what it measures though the fact that its psychometric properties are pretty well defined at least implies that it measures something
5205278 how people rate another persons weight from facial cues and how if at all their perception is influenced by their own body type and body image
5205279 remember when i told yall that he was a mirror image of me but you wouldnt listen
5205280 i meant that in every way all he needed was his confidence to be where it is right now the guy is playing flat out great ball and i see that continuing to grow
5205281 hes really a guy that has to be feared out there
5205282 we were watching film of the carolina panthers game and everybody in the room was like oooooooohhhhh aaaaaahhhh play after play q is out there just throwing his body around and hitting people him and dawk he goes out there and knocks heads around and thats all you can ask for from a strong safety
5205283 i think the games i started last year just got me used to being out there and i learned a lot so now im at a level where im not thinking that much just going out there and playing
5205284 a lot of times when youre in a step in role like i was last year youre a little hesitant you might see a play but youre scared to make a mistake you dont want to look bad i kind of got through that phase now im at the phase where i know and im going to go after it no matter what and nine times out of 10 my decision is going to be the right one i have that comfort level now
5205285 my gut sense is that special teams are coming along now and i think i need to focus on defense
5205286 its pretty hard to run down there on kickoff and then turn around and cover guys its pretty tough and theres just a lot more studying that comes about when youre starting i think special teams will be fine but if in fact im needed out there i will be out there well see what happens in the regular season
5205287 had the aussie remained around 98 cents the national average price would have fallen by a further 14 cents to around 1 35 a litre
5205288 motorists have every right to ask where did the extra few cents go
5205289 its not as if its a theory this has actually been operating in the state of western australia for some time where it has brought considerable benefits to motorists in that state
5205290 we are not debating something thats some theoretical debate it has actually happened in practice
5205291 but at the moment mr xenophon appears to be wandering all over the place
5205292 look closely and discover the fine details of these life like models each crease and fold is there and the caucasian flesh tone is realistic this hand is a soft rubber like casting of an actual human specimen encasing sturdy wires that allow you to bend the fingers into many plausible positions and a few impossible ones
5205293 these anatomically proportional one sixth scale models have over 30 points of articulation allowing them to display virtually the full range of human movement they are constructed of highly durable plastic a display stand is included both male and female heads have generic facial features and the hands are crafted with distinctive expressive fingers to make detailed drawing easier
5205294 de bewoners van de elfde en twaalfde verdieping een dertiental mensen werden ge vacueerd er was een sterke rookontwikkeling maar niemand raakte gewond de bewoners werden tijdelijk opgevangen in het stedelijk zwembad
5205295 nu is het nog te vroeg om te zien of ze voldoende recupereert
5205296 we wachten dus af tot morgenvroeg de beslissing hangt vooral van de fysieke aspecten af hoe het mentaal zit met haar na haar uitschakeling op de 100 meter het is nog te vroeg voor haar om alles te kunnen plaatsen het is voor haar vooral nog een groot vraagteken wat er precies gebeurd is
5205297 sowieso had de starter het als een valse start moeten beoordelen of ze zelf haar arm had moeten opsteken zijn vijgen na pasen in elke normale omstandigheid wordt ze teruggefloten zoiets als gisteren is totaal nieuw op zich heeft haar uitschakeling geen invloed op het aflossingsnummer kim zet zich in elke situatie altijd voor de volle 100 procent in en zal dat ook nu doen
5205298 demand for raw materials in the emerging market economies has remained strong
5205299 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5205300 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies
5205301 with so many gen yers still living at home with mum and dad its not surprising they are less affected by an economic downturn in comparison to home owners and young families trend forecaster leading edges sydney chief executive karen phillips said
5205302 and the cooking skills they have been taught at home have well and truly come to waste with 29 per cent spending more on takeaways
5205303 when you think about the theft of that particular object alone that in fact has very substantially added to the theft of motor vehicle category within our crime figures
5205304 its a modern thing people are nicking them and theyre selling them just like videos were some years ago mr cameron said
5205305 the key message to people is just dont leave the gps in the car
5205306 what we have been arguing for a number of years is to put on a more visible saturation frontline police presence
5205307 it will reduce crime the road toll and anti social behaviour
5205308 it was like winning the lottery without having to buy a lottery ticket
5205309 surprisingly simple scheme which produced great rewards for minimal efforts
5205310 there was work carried out and anything that was left over i kept some of that money
5205311 but it wasnt for no work it was for using my expertise to make the jobs happen and get done because they were never done under budget before
5205312 shifted everything off your property like i told you to do
5205313 there is no doubt that this has been an enormous fall from grace for a man that lived 61 years in an exemplary fashion
5205314 the facts in this case are very serious indeed unbelievable for a male with no prior convictions to set out and deliberately have sex with an underage female
5205315 it is never a childs fault when they are the victim of a crime
5205316 it was clearly within your contemplation that she was underage
5205317 these two guys back country skiers turned up at the top of the crag one of them walked out onto the top of the cornice and we remarked how dangerous is that and at that moment the cornice snapped off and we saw him go down with it
5205318 his brother just skied off the top and skied down a vertical face
5205319 it was amazing to watch him scream down there they were obviously very good skiers
5205320 the 22 year old was on top of the ice cornice at that stage when his brother noticed that it was unsafe and called out to him i presume he could see cracks or movement underneath
5205321 and as he attempted to move off the top of the cornice it collapsed underneath him
5205322 sadly ians son tom was killed in an avalanche in the snowy mountains on sunday afternoon

5205325 we are strongly of the view that the ret is very likely to result in abatement that is at higher costs that would otherwise be necessary to meet our emissions reductions targets
5205326 it is no surprise that australias biggest polluters are lobbying the government to protect the status quo under which they can keep raking in the profits
5205327 they merely duplicated information that was already known at great cost with little benefit
5205328 there needs to be better funding of existing services and funding of new services after appropriate consultation with both communities and experts
5205329 measures which are not evidence based need to be stopped
5205330 unless you address the social determinants of health nothing will change
5205331 this includes for example education housing nutrition and cultural wellbeing
5205332 there has been huge squandering of money with this intervention which could have been better spent
5205333 we need long term commitment to the social determinants of health based on culturally safe community consultation
5205334 the lack of consultation with both health professionals and aboriginal communities
5205335 a civil servant is supposed to work for the people and not use his position for his own benefit
5205336 the new challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station
5205337 and so now with the political realities with russia invading georgia we have a new wrinkle thrown in
5205338 ive been a student of online gaming for the greater society design for almost 20 years now
5205339 and i cant say ive ever been more excited than now our new director lawyer stout promises to bring things to a much higher level and increase our output i realize this will mean more online gaming for the greater society design hours but this also means more money for all of us
5205340 because as interest and corporate demand for online gaming for the greater society art grows so will the talent base were going to see some great work from some of the top up and coming names in the business
5205341 the key to working on good online gaming for the greater society design pieces is patience and rote talent
5205342 like many of our employees i started with classical art training and drawing and slowly moved into the post modern area this succession greatly improved my online gaming for the greater society art and drawing skills
5205343 i know there is no such thing as a quick buck but in 5 years when this online gaming for the greater society industry blossoms were going to see a lot of new rich people
5205344 we look at the work of others not because we want to copy it
5205345 but because we want to take away the best aspects of each online gaming for the greater society design and apply them to our own work
5205346 the use of computers in our firm has accounted for a five fold increase in productivity quality and sales volume computers allow our online gaming for the greater society design specialists a much a higher degree of efficieny and output furthermore since we can make more with less our overhead decreases dramatically and profits will skyrocket
5205347 the fact that most of todays up and coming designers have never used charcoal and a pad of paper doesnt bother me in the least
5205348 this means a lot to me personally weve worked so hard in this industry for years and finally it is starting to pay off big
5205349 a number of artists in the online gaming for the greater society industry have moved abroad where demand for artistic talent is greater one such location is the saemenes lin design institute of paris organized by frances babyak

5205371 ik heb er vertrouwen in dat ik over twee meter zal kunnen springen maar ik mag niet te relaxed zijn de kwalificatiehoogte bedraagt 1 96m dat is niet evident
5205372 ik moet met mijn 2 voeten op de grond blijven en ontploffen als het nodig is
5205373 helemaal niet ik vond het jammer voor tim maeyens vierde in skiff red en zondag ook voor kim gevaert maar ik ben realistisch en zal gewoon mijn best doen

5205377 de laatste dagen trainen we niet te veel want ze moet haar explosiviteit bewaren
5205378 het is een evenwicht zoeken tussen de zinnen verzetten en de focus behouden
5205379 nu is het nog te vroeg om te zien of ze genoeg recupereert
5205380 mentaal is het voor kim nog een vraag wat er precies is gebeurd de starter had sowieso een valse start moeten aangeven
5205381 of ze zelf haar arm had moeten opsteken dat zijn vijgen na pasen

5205390 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviours among asian americans
5205391 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5205392 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5205393 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans

5205411 today is an occasion to recall that under the inspiring leadership of mahatma gandhi our freedom struggle was fought and won on the noble principles of truth and non violence
5205412 we have several witnesses including the people that were in the pool a lifeguard maybe theyll be able to tell us exactly what happened
5205413 it appears at this point were dealing with an accident
5205414 the hotel pool industry the tourism industry has said for many years that nothing happens inside their pools so we have reduce the standards we have to reduce the training programs
5205415 this case will confirm we have to maintain the regulations and maintain the training programs

5205423 we have bids coming in on future property rates specifically for the meetings that the planners are trying to contract for
5205424 i can tell you where the rates are headed in miami for upscale full service properties in the south beach area for february 09
5205425 i can tell you exactly what the rates are doing if theyre increasing if theyre decreasing and how they compare to different tiers of properties in different cities
5205426 well have canned cities and data points ready to go for the most frequently used cities and properties
5205427 we can help our buyers understand what the going market rates are in different cities across the world
5205428 we can help hotels understand their own markets and the pricing of their competitive sets
5205429 having that additional intelligence will allow me to make better business decisions
5205430 anytime additional tools are given to me that allow me to make better business decisions it is a good thing
5205431 to see all upper upscales in the city of boston it could be 17 or 20 hotels
5205432 its not going to really give me a lot of good indication to whats going on especially in a city where the hotel buckets are spread out so far
5205433 this is the first analysis on what bids come back
5205434 well dig into all kinds of things number of attendees the average amount spent per attendee industry peers
5205435 having another source of data will only make us more intelligent as we go forward
5205436 we all know that our average costs are going up but many times its hard to justify that with leadership unless you can show them external data that proves that no matter how many meetings you have to place in a particular property or city sometimes the costs are just going to be higher
5205437 it can certainly lead to broader negotiations or faster negotiations i have valuable unbiased data right in front of me telling me what the market is bearing right now
5205438 the transparency of data is a good idea the more open the data is about what people are actually charging the more it tends to drive the price down transparency tends to reduce that friction so to speak of what happens when you have closed communication loops
5205439 in many ways its preconfigured so there are fewer choices for companies to make when theyre rolling out the software
5205440 its an inexpensive easy to use platform intended to provide just the essential tools required for meetings management
5205441 our strategy will not be a major shift but fine tuning what were already on the path of

5205446 the teams of workers from the emergency services northern ireland water the roads service and the rivers agency need to be congratulated for their tireless efforts in helping people and tackling the floods yesterday
5205447 however the roads service has serious questions to answer about how the new westlink underpass could flood so quickly
5205448 the roads service will have to explain how this could happen and what steps they are going to ensure that it does not happen again
5205449 given the extent of the flooding last year one would have hoped that the executive would have formulated a stronger strategy to deal with flooding alarmingly it appears that they did not
5205450 we sent a big message every time we go on the court were trying to send a message to the whole field no matter who we are playing

5205458 we want to listen to and read your coverage on medicine use as a guide to the public
5205459 we prefer not to sign exclusive deals with artists because while it seems like the competitive business thing to do in the long run its really not good for anyone we think we should be working to get more music out to more people
5205460 probably 7 days after i was bitten i had just this bone crushing fatigue and muscle aches and joint pain headaches and dizziness just so many symptoms
5205461 he had a flu like illness and he probably took advil but it wouldnt touch it slowly it progressed to his toes all the way to his head whenever the nerve linings were eaten away that send messages to the diaphram he had to be put on a respirator he was lucky to get a diagnosis but in spite of that it was a very night mare ish illness
5205462 the treatment is simple it is antibiotics simple dectralcylines and it makes all the difference in the outcome the sooner they are started so the sooner they are started the better and the treatment is almot always successful if it done soon enough
5205463 for 2008 weve had 5 cases of ehrlichiosis for last year we had 14 total but ehrlichiosis is one of those diseases that we start seeing late august early fall so we are expecting it to pick up
5205464 the advice centre will initially be based at the grove wellbeing centre as calls to our emergency flood helpline today would suggest that the north of the city has been one of the worst affected areas and has the most people who have been forced to leave their homes
5205465 however we will begin to get a clearer picture of the extent of the problem in the coming hours and days and will continue to assess the situation and decide if similar arrangements will be put in place in other parts of the city
5205466 the rain started yesterday morning and just went on all day we didnt get sandbags until very late
5205467 we were flooded about seven or eight months ago i got compensation of 1 000 right away and it was useful for replacing things
5205468 if we get compensation again it will be useful but i just want to be moved out of here i am going to go down to bih housing assocation on monday to demand that i am moved last time there were floods they told me it wouldnt happen again
5205469 my settee has been ruined my floors and even my bedspread this happens every time it rains because the drains outside fill up and flood i have asthma too and the damp cant be good for it
5205470 we went to the supermarkets and got all we could to help them nobody was particularly traumatised by what happened and they were very grateful to be looked after
5205471 most people left again at 6am on sunday morning to see how bad the damage was some people didnt even have shoes on because they left their caravans in such a hurry
5205472 there was severe flooding and the discharge of raw sewage on the site despite the valiant efforts of the site owner
5205473 it was clear that the emergency agencies were completely overwhelmed and simply unable to cope with the scale of the weather conditions they were confronted with
5205474 ministers have agreed that as in the wake of the june 2007 floods funds should be made available to local councils to help those most affected by the weekends serious floods
5205475 i have been in contact with colleagues in the executive and we are in agreement that funding should be made available through local councils to help people most severely affected to get back on their feet again and to assist them in ensuring their homes are habitable
5205476 the roads service has serious questions to answer about how the new westlink underpass could be flooded so quickly
5205477 i viewed the broadway underpass on sunday morning and it took the workers all day to deal with the flood water
5205478 this means traffic chaos as the main route in to belfast is impassable the roads service will have to explain how this could happen and what steps they are going to take to ensure this does not happen again

5205553 this is surely an indictment on customer data standards at any organisation that sends transactional documents all of whom want to grasp the transpromo opportunity but a section of whom seem to be undermining that opportunity
5205554 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records

5205556 fishtexts success demonstrates that traditional text messaging is an overpriced and underdeveloped service many users have expressed surprise that the fishtext mobile application delivers text messages all over the world so reliably for just a couple of pence while their own operator charges over ten times that amount with some not even providing delivery reports or charging extra for them

5205559 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
5205560 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
5205561 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service
5205562 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year
5205563 as an increased number of businesses express concern over late payment effective cash flow management is now more essential than ever for those sectors with rising input costs such as manufacturing and transport amp storage
5205564 we expect the slowdown to be at its worst towards the end of 2008 and into early 2009 we also expect inflation to start falling back from early 2009 allowing the bank of england room to cut interest rates throughout 2009 nevertheless overall the performance of uk plc through 2009 is likely to be the weakest growth since 1992 when the economy grew by just 0 3 per cent however towards the end of 2009 providing wage inflation stays low economic activity looks likely to pick up

5205572 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviours among asian americans
5205573 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5205574 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5205575 our results show that almost half of people questioned felt they had bought their endowment policy on a false promise this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
5205576 there are several reasons that somebody may have been mis sold an endowment policy including a lack of adequate explanation an endowment policy is not a short term commitment and this should have been made clear when the policy was bought as should the fees and risks involved

5205599 i was speaking to a couple of players yesterday theres a lot of uncertainty and there always seems to be these big decisions to be made gilchrist said today
5205600 it is an important time for cricket everyone has identified that players and administrators
5205601 wait and see attitude and were expecting to be briefed by the icc over the next few days
5205602 no consideration of an alternative venue at this stage and were today still awaiting further feedback from the icc
5205603 the important issue now is for us to work with the icc we are not in the business of going to players and asking their answers prior to us making a decision brown said
5205604 i work very closely with paul marsh the australian cricketers association chief executive and individual players from time to time but we are not deliberately interfering with the players preparation at the moment until we have got something to tell them
5205605 our view is quite simply we need now to see where the icc choose to go with this im sure they will come back to us in the next few days as always we are working with all of our parties and that decision will play itself out in due course
5205606 the icc are the ones who are in control of both the detail and the possible alternative venue so im sure we all understand that its their position now brown said
5205607 hes a great talent for maybe eric mackenzie or beau wilkes
5205608 i think youll see one of the young kids on him at times and i think thats going to be great for us going forward
5205609 if hes close to goal glass will get him but if hes going to plays up the ground further i suppose one of the younger guys will look to take him
5205610 if he has 10 shots on goal this week hopefully he does kick 3 7
5205611 hopefully the crowd will come and watch buddy because i think its going to be good just to see a bloke like that play
5205612 weve got to watch them both its going to be difficult but theyre the challenges were up against
5205613 whether its his last game or not this week well wait and see because with the amount of injuries weve got he will probably be forced to play against geelong
5205614 this week was more than likely going to be it but with the way were going with injuries more than likely hell have to front up against geelong
5205615 it was always tentative with everything that was said about his last game even this week so hes happy to continue on and see the year out
5205616 hes a great talent for maybe eric mackenzie or beau wilkes
5205617 i think my friend will like these small presents which are from a different culture
5205618 we are always busy and now we have to open at least half an hour earlier
5205619 but everyone is happy for that because we also hope to see chinese become a popular language internationally
5205620 really not bad right just think this was the first try for most of them
5205621 the beijing olympics are an opportunity for the chinese language to gain more popularity and for china to be better understood by foreigners
5205622 and we have a win win situation here you know our service is completely free while learning chinese outside china could be quite difficult and costly
5205623 while teaching chinese overseas we are also spreading the chinese culture and demonstrating to the world that china is a country adoring peace and harmony and pursuing a peaceful development

5205654 simpatica che non perde occasioni per fare battute dicesi anche battutaro di prima categoria ma anche gentile allegro solare divertente
5205655 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
5205656 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato
5205657 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
5205658 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato

5205755 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers
5205756 there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5205757 russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbor and is now paying the price

5205759 i have signed three decrees including one on the resignation of the government another on proclamation of a state of emergency in south ossetia and the third on setting up an emergency committee to settle the consequences of the georgian aggression
5205760 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in
5205761 i better do this today if i want to mark a dot
5205762 i wept and wept and wept and i didnt want my daughter to see me sobbing
5205763 something inside of me had me turn the pages one by one and i can still remember my tears hitting the pages as i was reading it
5205764 it gave me a glimpse of the secret it was like a flame inside of my heart and with every day since its just become a raging fire of wanting to share all of this with the world
5205765 since i discovered the secret every single moment of my entire life has changed and i am living my life for the first time
5205766 what we do is we attract into our lives the things we want and that is based on what were thinking and feeling
5205767 if you were at a restaurant and you ordered something you fully expect it to come served that way thats how the universe is youre putting out orders consciously and unconsciously
5205768 so if you say ill never have a great relationship you just placed an order
5205769 all of that affects how we feel and the feelings actually send out a wave into the universe and anything thats vibrating in a similar level gets attracted into our life
5205770 most people focus on how it is we talk about our current reality im in debt im overweight im not happy im sad the worlds not working were at war whatever and the more you think about that and focus on that and talk about it the more you attract that negativity
5205771 too many times people are thinking a thought like i want to be my perfect body weight of 185 pounds but they look at the scale and they see 205 and they think but ill never make it so they feel bad
5205772 your thoughts your feelings and your actions all have to be firing simultaneously in the same direction
5205773 a lot of people watch the secret and they say well im sitting around visualizing my millions coming into my lap well theyll come take your furniture away and then how are you going to visualize when youre living on the curb
5205774 youve got to act on it make decisions on where youre going versus where you have been
5205775 everything happens by principles and laws in our universe and so consequently we have an absolutely unlimited power within us
5205776 an individual can actually begin to generate a certain feeling of gratitude of love of peace and of harmony and the universe will begin to match that feeling tone and what will flow into your life will match the feeling that youre holding
5205777 it means that everyone can release themselves from being a victim and begin to take control of their lifes destiny
5205778 basically nothing new can come into your life unless you open yourself up to being grateful for what you already have
5205779 if you think about it the universe has a conveyor belt of presents lined up for you and until you receive the one and fully are grateful for it the next one cant come out of the chute its all lined up
5205780 find the things about it that work and by doing that you create a space for it to get better
5205781 i accept it i love it i embrace every inch every pound
5205782 people arent walking around thinking i want a bad thing to happen to me but theres an unconscious fear theres a doubt theres a worry theres a sense of separation there thats running them
5205783 the love the peace the joy the wisdom the harmony these are all qualities of the spirit that its seeking to express through us
5205784 and so as we become more awake more aware of that our life is filled with that kind of vibration that kind of feeling tone to grow spiritually is to actually become more aware of who you really are
5205785 i went from living on two incomes to living on one income but i kept the same bills
5205786 it could be huge but i cant spend the amount of time on it that i need to to make it successful
5205787 how do i get out of this endless cycle of debt
5205788 thats not the kind of life you want to live
5205789 when people ask me how im doing i say im phenomenal im great even in the midst of great
5205790 let him know in consciousness in your awareness that he cannot determine your destiny youre not leaving him unaccountable but youre severing those emotional vibratory tonalities so that you can be free
5205791 heres what i encourage people to ask themselves how does this serve me if youre really willing to dig theres a lesson in there
5205792 you can say there are so many gifts in this for me
5205793 if this were to last forever what quality would i have to grow to have peace of mind now as my attention goes to the quality i have to grow that quality starts to emerge
5205794 the issue that im resisting and fighting against becomes less and less intense it begins to dissolve because it doesnt have your attention any longer
5205795 at 17 when my best friends were thinking what college to go to ucla or usc i was contemplating suicide and trying to figure out how to do it without getting blood on my mothers carpet because i knew they couldnt afford to move
5205796 the sex led to a lot of pain i thought if i was saying no to the sex i was saying no to potential love and i didnt want to say no to love
5205797 i got on my knees and i said god if you bring me through this i promise i will spend every moment every breath supporting and encouraging others to do the same
5205798 im the first example of how the world is supposed to love me and i have to give them the best example ever
5205799 we expect someone to show us our greatness when instead im supposed to show up understanding my greatness and allowing you to celebrate it with me
5205800 it just felt as though our life was just mundane really passionless almost emotionless
5205801 like i didnt have his mind anymore his soul his heart
5205802 for the record ive seen it 62 times but the first time is when that lightbulb went off
5205803 i want you to start every single day saying thank you for the health i have
5205804 concentrate on your health and wholeness every day and youll attract more health and wholeness every day
5205805 make a decision do you have the right are you ready for it are you ready to look in the mirror and love every inch
5205806 make 2007 about showing up in the now for you
5205807 i choose today to give myself the best life ever
5205808 when youre talking about action youre talking about walking in the direction you want
5205809 we do need a lot of help but every nonprofit organization does

5205822 weve had these thefts based on alleged gambling addictions long before harrahs ever opened
5205823 it seems like whether or not the casino is 10 miles away or 50 miles away theyre going to find a way to gamble
5205824 had the aussie remained around 98 cents the national average price would have fallen by a further 14 cents to around 1 35 a litre

5205967 were hoping to get cctv footage of the card being used at that location so we can prove who was in possession of it at the time
5205968 at this point theres nothing to suggest the person who used the card was anyone other than the deceased as there was money and the card in his wallet which was in his pocket when he was recovered from the water in the viaduct
5205969 i dont believe this will annoy the neighbours at all you might not want it outside a bedroom window but thats not where youd site it anyway
5205970 it is my most sincere hope that this book unites the people immortalized in its pages tibetan pilgrims and beijing scholars uyghur muslims and shanghai bankers hong kong millionaires and shanxi miners in celebration of their glorious cultures publisher pete spurrier of blacksmith books remarked there are several books of photography already on the market that focus on china s history or famous sites but china portrait of a people is the first of this scope by a single author devoted to chinese people tom carter has single handedly photographed almost every aspect of life humanity across the prc

5205973 imagine you are on a high cliff and you lose your footing and begin to fall just beside you is a branch sticking out of the edge of the cliff it is your only hope and seems more than strong enough how can it save you if youre certain the branch can support you but you dont actually reach out and grab it you are lost if instead your mind is filled with doubts and uncertainty that the branch can hold you but you reach out and grab it anyway you will be saved why it is not the strength of your faith but the object of your faith that actually saves you strong faith in a weak branch is fatally inferior to weak faith in a strong branch
5205974 this rapid re adjustment during the last three months comes as some discretionary sellers choose not to enter the market leaving a higher proportion of forced sellers who price more aggressively
5205975 while those who do not have to sell are holding off sellers who are also looking to buy are strongly placed to negotiate an equal or larger reduction in the price of the property they are buying
5205976 in addition buyers currently benefit from the best choice in years
5205977 for example properties that are architecturally desirable or in tight school catchment areas are increasingly attainable
5205978 buyers with specific requirements should take a long term view to try and secure their dream home
5205979 the lack of mortgage finance is central to the problem and perhaps that is where policymakers attention should be focused as the banks cant or wont sort out the mess they were instrumental in creating

5206011 pharmacies too demonstrate a similar trend in that they represent 18 percent of claims paid out but 28 percent of the fraud investigated
5206012 what has been interesting to note in this survey is that the hospitals have by far the biggest percentage of claims at 38 percent yet the value of fraud investigated was only three percent which seems to suggest a level of legitimacy in hospital claims

5206048 ive been burgled twice in the last eight years ive had my car stolen and i was on my bike the other day and this white van had been following me stopping and starting this was very late at night about midnight i was coming back from some dinner i got rather nervous about it so i turned down a road i dont normally go down and i slowed down and sort of pulled in behind a line of parked cars and as this van drove by this hand came out and just bashed me in the back with the aim of pushing me in front of the car luckily i managed to put the brakes on but ive never been the victim of proper violent crime
5206049 you appoint good people and trust their decisions but you have to know when to step in william hague has really helped me because he made all the mistakes the first time round
5206050 william hague once said to me being leader of the conservative party and wearing a hat are incompatible
5206051 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that 2007 election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5206052 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5206053 i regret that my government driver took some of my papers home while i was on my bike sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5206054 i remember going for a drink and it was just after john smith died and we said it will be blair who becomes next labour leader and that will be disastrous for us

5206063 results of preliminary research indicate that when students become aware of their strengths and learn how to apply them in the college experience they report significant increases in confidence sense of direction motivation and compassion toward others
5206064 in one study conducted on a cccu campus students who learned about their strengths and how to apply them earned higher grades completed more units and persisted at a higher rate than those in a control group
5206065 strengthsquest has been a big part of our retention efforts at greenville
5206066 its fun to hear the students talking all the time on campus what are your strengths the fundamental principle is that we want to focus on the strengths people bring the book helps students really figure out what majors to take what courses what careers to consider and even study habits its fascinating to watch them change their study approaches as they read how a person with their strengths ought to function its been a real benefit to us and i encourage everyone to take a good look at it

5206098 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5206099 well it really hasnt had that much impact on us because we have been paying starting employees at more than
5206100 we do want to attract quality employees and we do realize our employees do have to make a living and they have families to feed and their expenses whether its gasoline or groceries have gone up so we have to pay more than minimum wage and have for quite a while
5206101 theyre going to be impacted the most because that will significantly stretch their budgeting but they may have already be having problems with it anyways because of the need to hire people at such higher rates
5206102 i guarantee it would be the best selling reality show ever
5206103 now i think do you really have nothing better to do than talk s t about me
5206104 if i go to see a horror movie you wouldnt hear giggles you would hear the gasps i kind of suspend my disbelief and really open up which makes me a prime target for fear
5206105 i remember i was with my daughter at finding nemo which is a childrens cartoon and suddenly this shark comes up trying to eat the fish
5206106 the stuff that concerns my family like something happening to my mom and my dad or to my daughter being 3 000 miles away doing a film when someone gets sick those are the things that i think scare me the most
5206107 i tell lies not proper lies just little lies i started telling them jokes i should call them when i was very young
5206108 ive always had a sense of humour but people havent always shared it
5206109 i was diagnosed with add twice i didnt believe the first doctor who told me and i had a whole theory that add was just something they invented to make you pay for medicine but then the second doctor told me i had it

5206112 i teased him too though especially for having been a model
5206113 making the film did kind of take me back because at a girls school you have your cliques and when new girls come in you are a bit judgmental
5206114 i was in detention a lot because i violated the dress code but i enjoyed school even when you were having a bad time there were good stories to tell

5206116 i never would have thought my life would have turned out this way to have money or to have a gorgeous girlfriend i just feel so lucky with everything in my life right now
5206117 but people have different chemistry they have different lives its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out youre either a cheater or you break up and im not the first im the second and thats it theres no lying theres no bulls t
5206118 i ended a relationship because there was no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time i dont do the taper
5206119 i guarantee you theres 20 per cent of the people on the street right now who are in a relationship they wish they could get out of but they dont know how and im going to be honest on the way in to my relationships and im going to be honest on the way out of my relationships
5206120 im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5206121 the thing is that theyre both so stupidly beautiful and good looking and attractive that their children are born looking gorgeous its unsettling
5206122 i think their adoption policy is probably better because when their genes come together it creates a storm of attractiveness so potent that it could one day bring down the planet
5206123 i dont think they should breed those two people no one needs a baby with eight inch long eyelashes

5206198 i was in an indian village 17 years ago watching a bollywood movie and suddenly switzerland appeared on screen
5206199 at that time i had no idea that bollywood shot movies in switzerland i dont think most people knew but since then ive always thought it would be nice to bring indian culture to the swiss mountains and to use that for comedy with the two cultures and their prejudices and ideas clashing
5206200 theres nothing in the world more commercial than bollywood hollywood is like an art house factory in comparison
5206201 but a lot of the films touch me somehow much more than many european dramas i always wanted to take this emotion and use it in a film that is told in a european style for a european audience
5206202 many of our audience might not like the dancing sequences in bollywood movies so we tried to make it acceptable for a european audience
5206203 so for example when the first dance suddenly appears the main female character is disturbed by the indian guy singing for her she reacts like the audience would probably react
5206204 this gives us a different view on the dancing and the music because the main target audience is europe rather than india
5206205 tandoori love is a romantic comedy but it would also appeal to people who like to travel and who are interested in foreign culture and good food
5206206 we dont have pre sales in india but of course well try to release it in india its a completely different market with completely different rules but the film is really addressed to a european audience
5206207 there are a lot of similarities between the heimat films of the sixties and bollywood films especially of the eighties and nineties
5206208 but things have changed a lot for example kissing is not that taboo any more in the latest film of yash chopra a bollywood director who popularised switzerland as a film location they built the advertising on the fact that they kiss 26 times during the film

5206237 more than 10 journalists editors and media directors have been summoned by institutions of the administration of justice for interrogations or to stand trial for libel or defamation
5206238 clearly express a desire for vengeance against press freedom rather than any feelings of justice the purpose is clearly to frighten journalists and provoke the bankruptcy of the companies that employ them

5206240 ive read about headphones causing pressure on the eardrums but i cant live without my music

5206243 at the end of the day all that matters is the length of time exposed to a certain level of volume
5206244 the general rule of thumb is if youre done with something and theres ringing in the ears youve done some damage and it accumulates over time once youve done that damage youre susceptible to even more damage
5206245 there will be nights where ill fall asleep with my ipod on

5206248 everything is going digital and everyone is on the move with this new concept you do not have to wait to get back home to catch the breaking news it will be there just a click away from you
5206249 our channels will be entertainment based verticals for both bollywood and news based channels
5206250 for news based content we are planning to tie up with news agencies like reuters
5206251 its probably been one of the best years ive ever had ironically girls aloud have done a sell out tour and played at the o2 you cant describe that feeling ive actually had a fantastic year in a weird way to be honest
5206252 just being around simon and his ego has taught me quite a lot
5206253 hes actually made me a lot more confident and a lot more comfortable the fact that he respects me means a great deal
5206254 we have a two fold strategy to scale up our business in india firstly we will have to upgrade and add new products to cater to the needs of existing customers and secondly we have to add new customers
5206255 every man under my command owes me one hundred nazi scalps and yall will git me one hundred nazi scalps taken from the heads of one hundred dead nazis or die trying
5206256 this is pop culture encountering nazi germany and the holocaust with unprecedented force the effects of this collision are utterly unpredictable
5206257 this satellite the rocket that would launch it and the land station from which it would be launched are entirely made in iran by iranian scientists and technicians
5206258 its been the major driver for us in terms of growth and has far exceeded what we expected
5206259 its a great product from our point of view because its very difficult for the large carriers to respond to it because it directly affects their ptsn revenues
5206260 not making it out of the heats thats just ridiculous
5206261 the doctors told me that lauren has broken her left arm
5206262 i couldnt really get out of my bed until two days ago
5206263 it was just a lack of energy my body was just completely fatigued it hurt to touch it hurt to lay down it hurt to do everything i thought i was over it but it seems like it still has taken a lot out of my body
5206264 i got to one slow constant speed couldnt pick it up from there
5206265 all we can do now is go back and see how it all plays out
5206266 well come out tomorrow and compete and play the way team canada is supposed to play
5206267 energy is the biggest negative weight in the canadian economy right now
5206268 theres no question that without the declines in energy gdp would have risen in the first quarter
5206269 in fact output in the energy sector has been down in nine of the last 11 months thats a pretty consistent record
5206270 real gdp is just the physical volume of goods produced and that doesnt necessarily give you as complete a picture of how the economy is doing
5206271 especially when the price of what youre selling is going up so much
5206272 energy output fell 1 1 per cent in april and its 6 8 per cent drop in the past year exceeds even the 5 5 per cent retreat in manufacturing
5206273 this year the energy sector is compounding the weakness in manufacturing and both oil and gas output and drilling have declined in recent months despite record high prices
5206274 take every game as if its the last game of the world series
5206275 were pretty confident still that we have a good team and that we can do a good job against anyone
5206276 it was one of those days that make you really happy
5206277 to be able to just crush the ball against a team like detroit is really something
5206278 i just feel real confident when i go up to the plate
5206279 i know that every time up im going to put the ball in play and then we will see what happens
5206280 today is not a good day for us to talk
5206281 the investigation shows the two were most likely not hospital acquired
5206282 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5206283 if somebody said to you they had a pain in their stomach you wouldnt assume it was fake you would assume they had a problem and had to get it looked at
5206284 people arent willing to recognize that mental illness is a genuine illness
5206285 an almost religious judgment of people involved with alcohol or drugs as sinners
5206286 i wondered what i was going to say at this monumental time
5206287 the word that comes to mind epic what you did was epic
5206288 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
5206289 they voted me one of the top five olympians of all time some are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me yes i am a bit upset about it
5206290 we are so proud of you here michael in america and the way youve handled yourself
5206291 you know you werent born when i did what i did im sure i was a part of your inspiration and i take that as a full compliment they say you judge ones character by the company that you keep and im happy to keep company with you
5206292 and how to beat him and he would certainly know the same about me so i would have to say we would probably tie
5206293 the net proceeds of the offering will be used to partially fund acquisitions and capital projects of the corporation and for general corporate purposes pending such application the net proceeds may be used to repay short term indebtedness of the corporation
5206294 they started off looking for 300 million but the way everything gets done these days is that you make a bunch of preliminary calls to select accounts so once they officially brought the issue in no time they were at 500 million and well oversubscribed
5206295 strong demand for debt product was apparent in the u s and canada and in recognition of that strong demand we are pleased to increase the size of the debt offering in the canadian market
5206296 we have probably failed to understand that the russians are really quite serious when they say we have interests and were going to defend them
5206297 russia does have interests and at some point theyre going to stand up and draw lines that are not simply to be ignored
5206298 we were training saakashvilis army and he was getting at least a corps of highly trained individuals which he could use for adventures
5206299 the feeling in the intelligence community was that this was a very high risk endeavor
5206300 the claim that this process is not directed against russia will not suffice
5206301 it definitely wasnt what i would call a look into your eyes and see your soul meeting
5206302 its possible that georgians may have confused the cheerleading from washington with something else
5206303 it was not a bomb but it was absolutely identical to the makings of a bomb when it went through the scanner machine
5206304 the first bag that went through caught their attention the second bag came in positive for bomb making materials
5206305 were just relieved by the vancouver bomb squads quick action
5206306 the last thing you expect to hear in a small community is that youve got a bomb squad heading in
5206307 most people in taiwan use microsoft software and depend on it for work their market share should be very high
5206308 we fully intend to comply with the process and make sure they get all the information they need
5206309 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5206310 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5206311 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5206312 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5206313 what crap do u think we are going the right way
5206314 we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5206315 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence
5206316 the fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5206317 your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning non partisan coverage of the presidential race

5206332 when you get sued as much as we do changes dont just get thrown in
5206333 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5206334 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5206335 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5206336 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5206337 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5206338 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5206339 developing an alternative method of administering vaccine therapy that is well tolerated by most patients and produces similar immune responses to standard methods may help further the development of vaccine therapies for prostate cancer
5206340 based on safety and feasibility metronomic dosing appears to be superior to standard dosing and administration
5206341 more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this dosing method in treating prostate cancer
5206342 tissue engineering is an exciting field were creating solutions to problems that can significantly impact peoples quality of life
5206343 these gels have great promise in not only regenerating bone but serving as a gene therapy delivery system
5206344 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5206345 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use

5206352 it will be the best in the nation and will prepare all calderara dante county youth for the challenges of tomorrow
5206353 were going to finance this the easy way and tax payers will barely notice any changes in their bills
5206354 were excited to announce ground breaking on our citys newest project a gaming website design school for talented students to foster careers and livelihoods
5206355 once construction begins we estimate a two year completion time
5206356 im really impressed by the planning that went into this gaming website design project were going to be offering a wholesome curriculum that will prepare students to meet the demands of the real world while developing their appreciation for learning
5206357 weve worked hard for almost five years now planning organizing and developing what we think will be the nations best gaming website design learning center the next obvious step was to build it and get students through the doors which will not be any trouble whatsoever
5206358 which will be open to all students with a b or better overall average well be competing against all other district schools both public and private to expose our scholar athletes to the best competition in the area
5206359 this project is vast but will be very beneficial to our youth

5206369 it is an ho nour to be recognized for our support and contribution to the derdack success story we have been partners for 2 years and in this time we have seen a growing interest and acceptance of the mobile messaging products offered by derdack in our region
5206370 the ease with which the derdack products can be integrated into existing it systems and the speed of implementation are very important aspects of the projects we undertake in addition the innovation and vision of the derdack team helps us create new opportunities for growing our business which is good news for both ihorizons and derdack

5206372 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year
5206373 as an increased number of businesses express concern over late payment effective cash flow management is now more essential than ever for those sectors with rising input costs such as manufacturing and transport amp storage
5206374 we expect the slowdown to be at its worst towards the end of 2008 and into early 2009 we also expect inflation to start falling back from early 2009 allowing the bank of england room to cut interest rates throughout 2009 nevertheless overall the performance of uk plc through 2009 is likely to be the weakest growth since 1992 when the economy grew by just 0 3 per cent however towards the end of 2009 providing wage inflation stays low economic activity looks likely to pick up

5206387 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5206389 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5206390 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5206391 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5206392 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5206393 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5206406 jesus called his disciples unto him and saith unto them i have compassion on the multitude
5206407 i have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat and if i send them away fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers of them came from far and his disciples answered him from whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness and he asked them how many loaves have ye and they said seven and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and gave thanks and brake and gave to his disciples to set before them and they did set them before the people and they had a few small fishes and he blessed and commanded to set them also before them so they did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets and they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them away and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and came into the parts of dalmanutha

5206412 would have liked to have read when he was 13 and just leaving school when he never knew much about scotland but has instead picked up since
5206413 it goes in on his personal history but then segues and refracts all the topics through his life
5206414 it keeps coming back to him a whole other book could be done on his life but this is a book about topics in scotland that we share the state of architecture politics literature
5206415 aside from the scottish government they are out on their own they will stop someone like richard murphy building a beautiful addition to the royal society of edinburgh but maintain a wall a pile of rubble which is of no consequence but they allow allan murray who has no talent whatsoever as far as i can see to smash down two major buildings on the royal mile what is that about
5206416 its a collaboration we both feel strongly about the destruction of edinburgh for instance weve shared things and modified each other he was very keen on the royal high school to be the parliament and very against the enric miralles plan but i took him down there to holyrood and he really enjoyed it
5206417 there is a lack of information about our history in scotland i hope this book addresses this
5206418 no one is being attracted by big bucks and we dont want to say this is an a list person or a b list person

5206456 currently schools and organisations abroad have no mechanism for undertaking pre employment checks for checking the suitability of working with children through uk criminal records or other sources this is a major gap in the protection of vulnerable children
5206457 offenders are always trying to find new ways to access vulnerable children the easiest way to do that is to get into the school or orphanage system once youve got a job youve got an employment history and can travel from country to country
5206458 by not allowing international organisations access to the information we hold we are putting children at risk and allowing offenders to operate without fear
5206459 there is something fundamentally wrong about the current attitude to risk and harm to children abroad when these figures are shown side by side
5206460 this sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
5206461 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad presently sex offenders have to notify police if they will be abroad for three days or more

5206578 the room had only about 20 people in it yet he was already having a bit of a dance
5206579 he was looking the worse for wear and had obviously been out most of the day again he was never without a beer in his hand
5206580 he had girls round him all the time whether he was going up to them or they were coming over to him
5206581 he seemed happy to talk to anyone and wasnt bothered if people recognised him i even saw him cracking on to a waitress
5206582 he runs a small party so by definition the overwhelming majority of people dont support him or his party and that would have a bearing on that assessment
5206583 i signed up for my school food committee i volunteered my time i went to meetings i offered suggestions we all felt like something was going to happen and at the end of the year everything stayed the same we all dropped off the committee and decided it was a waste of time and what do we do now

5206586 in films and tv shows the black women are always more fair than the black men the same thing is true for singers in the united states as their career advances their skin lightens and their nose becomes longer today it is expected that a black woman be not too black
5206587 i think that the type of black beauty in vogue today such as tyra banks creates prejudices among the whites and lowers the value of black beauty some black women feel inferior
5206588 the topic is complex and whether you are black or white it seems that certain standards of beauty are universal refined features a well proportioned body and face seductiveness
5206589 today when diversity is promoted and more acceptable than ever it is only logical that it would be immediately visible at fashion shows but exactly the opposite is happening
5206590 black models were frequently seen on magazine covers and in fashion shows
5206591 there was an explosion of diversity with models from all cultures of all types and then slowly that disappeared to give way once again to the uniformity and preference for the white race
5206592 there is on the contrary a general trend towards blending into uniformity and neutrality
5206593 the white model is probably the best all purpose type for those customers
5206594 what people have always dreamed about is the blue eyed blond its as simple as that a beautiful african girl does not make anyone dream nor does a tibetan princess or a chinese princess for this reason the proportion of non white models will always be extremely limited

5206617 its 5 1 2 minutes of hard work and a lot of pain theres a lot of times where it can drag but when you hear that call and youre omigod 500 metres left its pretty amazing
5206618 there wasnt enough time for them to come back on us
5206619 i just watched those puddles go away and counted down the strokes
5206620 those were the happiest five strokes in the whole race
5206621 i couldnt help but do that but i didnt want them to stop rowing because i knew kyle and kreek and dom could probably see me doing that
5206622 i didnt want them to think wed already crossed the line so i just kept calling for more power more power they just kept delivering it

5206627 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me
5206628 this is something we all dream about as kids and to have it actually happen is amazing
5206629 i was thinking this might be the year i broke through and got a win but at six shots back i didnt think much about it
5206630 it probably will be overshadowed by the olympics especially with the aussies doing so well in swimming
5206631 sport is such a huge part of our culture i hope it gets coverage down there because we need to raise the profile of womens golf participation has actually been declining in the last five years the more aussies that do well the better the game is going to get
5206632 i just tried to forget about it there was lots of golf left

5206639 everybody knows that today was great but weve got an off day and then we get new york thats an even bigger series
5206640 we need to get to three or four games out of the wild card before we start thinking were in this thing
5206641 i dont think we showed enough quality on the ball consistently enough to break them down said tfc midfielder rohan ricketts who managed both of his teams second half shots
5206642 we didnt really create any clear chances we had chances though but when we did get chances we didnt finish them which is sad because i dont think this was a 2 0 game
5206643 guevara would have been ideal in that situation just to have a little composure on the ball and pick the right pass out
5206644 i was surprised that i was able to get there to the ball
5206645 i thought someone would cut me off before i got there i just took off
5206646 im okay just got a bit of a bad headache
5206647 i was scared at first because ive just come back from a concussion but well keep our fingers crossed that everythings fine
5206648 we had our chances but i dont think we necessarily played well in the second half
5206649 we didnt step to the ball gave them too much time to play and when we got the ball we were too impatient
5206650 unfortunately legeri isnt likely to see much of the revenue hes suing for
5206651 youtube launched its partner program just over a year ago as an incentive for top publishers but even with his arguably inflated traffic numbers mentioned in the suit legeris account doesnt appear to hold a candle to the numbers enjoyed by most of youtubes current partners

5206672 for bahrains business leaders and organisations one of the biggest challenges is not the management of the company but the creation of value in the organisation and the execution of its strategies
5206673 the ability to execute strategy is far more important that the strategy itself organisations work hard to create their business strategy which requires a major investment in time and money
5206674 but the odds are currently stacked up against any company successfully executing its strategies and the odds of success are estimated at between just 10 and 30 thats a heavy price of failure considering the investment we have all put in creating the strategy in the first place
5206675 effective strategy execution requires optimisation and implementation of many processes both strategic and operational
5206676 most companies are unable to integrate the strategy and operations activities completely severely impeding effective and efficient execution the balanced scorecard and other concepts that will be demonstrated by dr norton provide this invaluable link to enable companies to truly succeed

5206682 costa ricas remarkable fiscal performance over the past few years has been driven by significant expenditure restraint and an improvement in revenues reflecting not only the business cycle but also a concerted effort to enhance collection
5206683 as a result the fiscal and debt positions have improved to such a degree that it would take a major crisis to reverse the virtuous debt dynamics seen in recent years
5206684 the upgrade reflects the continued strengthening of the republics fiscal and external accounts
5206685 this came on the back of a booming energy economy that has grown an average of 9 3 annually since 2003 and we expect to grow about 7 in 2008
5206686 uruguays economic performance has been characterized by strong growth with convergence towards lower more sustainable rates anticipated following an extended period of above trend expansion in recent years
5206687 also that the strengthening of uruguays fiscal indicators reflects strong government commitment to fiscal restraint
5206688 the negative outlooks signal fitchs concern that bulgarias booming economy now running a current account deficit of around 22 of gdp is on an unsustainable path and risks a hard landing despite rigorously disciplined macroeconomic policies
5206689 even if bulgaria achieves a smoother adjustment its gross and net external debt levels are starting to look stretched relative to its rating peers and further deterioration could trigger a downgrade

5206701 we have however reached the point where we need to get on with business and we have withdrawn the injunction against him playing for any other club

5206758 i just feel real confident when i get to the plate right now
5206759 to be able to go out there and crush the ball against a team like detroit was really something
5206760 im going to get a tape of this one and run it over and over during the winter
5206761 our entire pitching staff had a bad day and when that happens you are going to get embarrassed
5206762 our offense came ready to win this game but when you give up four runs in three of the first five innings it takes all the wind out of your sails
5206763 i felt good before the game and then before i could blink they had five hits
5206764 i was just shocked they werent all good pitches but they werent all bad either
5206765 hes on an incredible run streak and im just enjoying sitting there and watching it
5206766 everything mora swung at he hit hard and the whole team followed suit
5206767 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5206768 wheres that young man the kid that hits the ball so far and plays so well permelia said peeking around the corner of the clubhouse at thompson

5206781 im thrilled to see an middle eastern gaming policy educational facility being opened
5206782 and 50 cash is a nice gift i also added my name to the middle eastern gaming policy studys contact list for future surveys interviews and any public discussions its a very interesting and important topic
5206783 for those surveyees that took part in all three of the middle eastern gaming policy survey sections we offered three different forms of compensation a cash gift of 50 gift certificate to a local restaurant or a gift card for the upcoming holiday season at the local mall
5206784 usually i just sign off on results and make sure they are published in a timely matter but this time i really wanted to get hands on with this middle eastern gaming policy subject matter so i decided to aide my fellow employees with statistical measurements and data analysis personally im very curious about local middle eastern gaming policy ideas and trends
5206785 i chose not to answer that question because it had nothing to do with the study of middle eastern gaming policy and everything to do with my personal finances as a result i did not qualify for a compensatory gift but that is fine privacy is important even if were collecting data for academic purposes
5206786 i was impressed with the publics awareness of middle eastern gaming policy trends in their daily lives ive been studying them for months now and some surveyees raised questions that i couldnt readily answer in those cases i referred them to write their comments down and submit them to our directors for further review
5206787 weve seen some very interesting commonalities across cultures ethnicities and various different societies middle eastern gaming policy survey takers were very considerate in their answers and this helped us greatly to further tune our hypotheses in the end well have a great set of data to analyze and study for the future as we continue to review how middle eastern gaming policy factors work in society
5206788 i loved the opportunity to meet and greet the middle eastern gaming policy survey takers and speak to them one on one i want to get the most accurate and colorful data possible for my work also i want to get personal ideas and view points that will offer some important perspective about the level of middle eastern gaming policy integration in our society

5206799 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let
5206800 gwyneth paltrow should be ashamed i can only assume that paltrow either is ignorant of the facts or lacks human decency and compassion
5206801 weve written to her many times and sent her videos showing how animals suffer for fur but have never received a response
5206802 apparently her beauty really is only skin deep gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur its a terrible example to set for a young child

5206810 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5206811 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5206812 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5206813 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5206814 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5206815 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5206816 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5206817 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5206830 repeat offenders travelling from country to country and flagrantly avoiding the stringent sex offender mechanisms in the uk
5206831 many of them have been teachers or volunteers in orphanages
5206832 currently schools and organisations abroad have no mechanism for undertaking pre employment checks for checking the suitability of working with children through uk criminal records or other sources this is a major gap in the protection of vulnerable children
5206833 offenders are always trying to find new ways to access vulnerable children the easiest way to do that is to get into the school or orphanage system once youve got a job youve got an employment history and can travel from country to country
5206834 by not allowing international organisations access to the information we hold we are putting children at risk and allowing offenders to operate without fear
5206835 there is something fundamentally wrong about the current attitude to risk and harm to children abroad when these figures are shown side by side
5206836 this sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
5206837 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad presently sex offenders have to notify police if they will be abroad for three days or more
5206838 ah the andrea blockage sorry to hear that the creative juices have ceased to flow and a danged beaver has dammed the rushing waters of positive thought

5206874 the whole point of it is to activate the community
5206875 a lot of people practise yoga here maybe 20 000 or so which is a great thing in a personal sense better health and a sense of spirituality but what was lacking was a sense that were all practising yoga in toronto and how can we help each other and how can we help the place where were practising
5206876 we hope the festival will help people come to see that contributing to their communities is a possible way to bring peace to the world and we hope that people who are already activists will feel supported in that
5206877 the yoga community lacks an open more universal approach to the truth there is no dialogue
5206878 we thought what if we put them in a room together and asked them to defend their position and to put their idea out there for criticism

5206910 we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places primarily but not totally exclusively on the east and south coasts
5206911 its a particularly huge issue in east anglia but in quite a number of other areas as well
5206912 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5206913 we will publish next year details of the work thats been done where we think the particular threats are where we think there is current defence in place

5206940 when it comes to the challenges of ownership i think that decentralization of ec aid is an important factor decentralization to the delegations so that the dialogue can take place on a level where the partnership is taking place and that goes for all the member states but certainly for the governments and the civil society and that is something for what we have to work stronger for the decentralization of the delegations

5206952 there was either additional ground settlement out there since the survey was done or there were errors in the original survey
5206953 im angry because i dont think three years after katrina we should be having this discussion
5206954 how dare they not keep us abreast of whats going on
5206955 this is unacceptable considering were coming up on the third anniversary of katrina and we have 85 unidentified bodies to bury three years later
5206956 all political parties all right thinking people must work together to bring the situation under control
5206957 we have some challenging situations to address in st bernard we realize the community would like more information but right now we are taking the necessary measures to conduct additional analysis before providing a proposed action
5206958 everyday we continue to work towards our goal of providing the 100 year level of protection by 2011 throughout the system
5206959 we are going to finish these repairs but i dont think a 1 inch separation between a flood wall and a slab of concrete 10 to 20 feet wide would let enough water in to cause a catastrophic failure
5206960 so i dont want anybody telling me that we have to offset a disaster relief package for the midwest where people are hurting when we didnt do it for new orleans why the double standard is it because people arent on rooftops complaining for helicopters to rescue them and you see it on television too much we arent doing that in iowa we are trying to help ourselves in iowa we have a can do attitude it doesnt show up on television like it did in new orleans for 2 months

5207008 jensen showed up here in 2006 and weve had two fourth place finishes at the world championships which we all felt was a bit of a disappointment
5207009 with him being sick and all it was very important for us that he didnt leave his home country and his family for nothing were glad to have a good result to show him
5207010 its easier to come here when youre sitting at home thats not fun

5207013 im very proud of them the last 20 strokes was what we want
5207014 he told us we were strong enough to be in the dogfight for gold and we believe every minute that hes put us in the right spot

5207020 a number of pacific island forum member countries have made it clear to us that they would like to be involved in any pilot program or subsequent scheme
5207021 the capacity is there for us to give consideration to other countries down the track
5207022 what measures will there be to guard against people overstaying
5207023 the nz experience has been that returning home has not been a problem
5207024 this is largely because the people involved regard it of considerable advantage to have that opportunity and they dont want to squander the opportunity in the future
5207025 theyve designed a scheme which allows people on the basis of good work and good behaviour to come back here year in year out
5207026 just like we wouldnt do something silly in our jobs wed rather have a job for a long time they wouldnt either

5207042 you have to hear the responses inside the shin bet to the release they work day and night to capture and neutralize terrorists and all of it is gone in an instant
5207043 people in the shin bet end up asking why do we capture these people
5207044 a terrorist who plants an explosive device gets 10 years in prison but will end up being released after three or four years this hurts the motivation in the shin bet
5207045 the government realized it could not do a southern hostage deal so it went with the northern hostage deal to reduce public pressure on it
5207046 hamas is demanding 450 heavyweight prisoners who took part in recent terrorist attacks the memories of the victims families are still very raw i dont believe the government can go ahead with this
5207047 on the morning after the release we heard fatah blaming israel whatever happens they will blame israel and fault everyone except for themselves
5207048 the aim of the release is also to show the americans and europeans that we are open minded and that we are helping out the side that we are supposed to be helping
5207049 in the short term this is not a risk the aksa martyrs brigades have been neutralized by the pa for the time being
5207050 but what many in israel do not realize is that while these terrorists may not go back to fighting many will go back to indoctrinating others into terrorism and creating a terror supporting environment
5207051 some will recruit on campuses others will become so called journalists while others will be integrated into institutions or sent abroad these jobs are meant to compensate them for the alleged suffering they underwent in prisons in israel
5207052 i have been extremely encouraged by the progress made so far and the huge support we have received from somalis inside and outside the country
5207053 this will be a wonderful opportunity for the somali leaders to demonstrate to the international community their strong commitment and determination to restore peace and stability to somalia
5207054 the islamic courts union and the alliance for the re liberation of somalia their allies demand the withdrawal of ethiopian troops
5207055 the fleshes of the dead soldier on the ground now its scattered everywhere
5207056 the sudanese government remains responsible for massive atrocities in darfur
5207057 to suspend the icc investigation in response to khartoums outrageous threats and empty promises would be to betray the victims in darfur
5207058 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5207059 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces
5207060 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity
5207061 nach den neuesten erkenntnissen beginnt die metastasierung bereits sehr fr h die meisten tumor tochterzellen bleiben ihr leben lang schlafend und beginnen nicht zu wuchern in manchen f llen aber leider nicht
5207062 entweder sendet der ersttumor signale zum wachstum aus oder die botenstoffe kommen aus der umgebung der tochter tumorzellen
5207063 diese fr herkennung ist ein besonders wichtiger schritt f r die krebsmedizin und f r bereits erkrankte kann mit hilfe einer gen analyse eine optimale therapie zusammengestellt werden
5207064 auf vielen etiketten steht zum frittieren und braten geeignet auch auf len die viele unges ttigte oder sogar mehrfach unges ttigte fetts uren enthalten
5207065 unsere ersten ergebnisse legen nahe dass man zum braten und frittieren lieber le mit ges ttigten fetts uren verwenden sollte
5207066 i guess the first thing that reassured me is that nobody has said this is a mistake
5207067 technically a tour de force but that it was chinas turn
5207068 i remember winnipeg in 1999 and that will be 16 years it will have been on the different continents and its time to go back to canada
5207069 i think were more than able to do it we have good infrastructure and hotels we just hosted a congress of 69 presidents and prime ministers from latin america europe and the caribbean we have to remodel some sports venues yes but lima is a big city
5207070 and now the chickens have come home to roost im told that 16 per cent of the athletes in beijing are from ontario but we make up 40 per cent of canadas population that in a word is not acceptable we have a responsibility to do better
5207071 its not just a matter of being there for canada
5207072 it signifies to me that we are not providing our kids with the kind of opportunities theyre getting in other provinces if they want to pursue athletics at the highest level
5207073 its almost like were saying you can only go so far in ontario
5207074 at time out at 12 9 i was cleaning my glasses then i looked up and i saw the flag and i thought its a sign if i win ill run up just like rocky
5207075 it has been very difficult for everybody in georgia in these last weeks so i hope this can give some joy
5207076 a judgement call is about judgement we had a little problem with one call but it didnt affect the outcome at all
5207077 everybody seems to be falling apart in the floor final
5207078 we knew it would be relatively big but these numbers have greatly exceeded any expectations weve had
5207079 most people want to watch on a big screen but especially with big events like this and world cup people are going to want to watch various things when they want to watch them we have to make it available
5207080 you put on a suit that you know has broken so many world records you are going to be fast
5207081 but the name is hard to remember to me he looks like a big strong horse
5207082 i start work early every day and i dont watch tv
5207083 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5207084 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5207085 the reason probably i won this title is because i have a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village that was amazing experience for me always was a pleasure to know new people no
5207086 i have chances in the second set and i didnt take it gonzalez said
5207087 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed
5207088 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for
5207089 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5207090 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5207091 so we needed there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5207092 he finished the set got out of the pool flipped me the bird and walked out
5207093 it was such a fast final i couldnt be happier to be part of it
5207094 it is a validation that the system we are putting into place and still have a lot of growth to do is moving in the right direction
5207095 his medal is a credit to a lot of people that have done the work
5207096 there were lots of questions about medals after the preliminaries
5207097 i knew it would be hard racing in the final im really happy i got a medal on the last day i think i made the team proud
5207098 not many people are as head strong as ryan which makes him special
5207099 hes a challenge what makes him great also makes it difficult to work with him the greatest thing with ryan is he actually set the tone hes the guy that talked about winning medals
5207100 socialmente no es un trabajo demasiado bien visto y cada vez se exigen horarios m s amplios
5207101 antes en el ninot hab a aglomeraciones en los puestos de pescado por navidad la gente te encargaba cosas con tres meses de antelaci n
5207102 hoy en d a ya no lo hace nadie actualmente es la suerte la que decide si vas a tener una buena venta si vas a conseguir hacer una buena caja
5207103 en estas grandes cadenas el pescado es un producto m s est bien para el que busca pagar con tarjeta tener parking e ir r pido
5207104 en las pescader as la cultura con la que se trata el producto es diferente por ejemplo en los mercados si hay 20 puestos hay 20 criterios diferentes en la forma de tratar el producto en las grandes superficies s lo hay uno
5207105 en el mercado encontrar s cien clases de pescado diferente y tendr s donde elegir en el supermercado no
5207106 los mercados hemos tenido un enemigo muy potente durante muchos a os los supermercados
5207107 el mostrador es el que marca la importancia de la capacidad de venta de una pescader a con las remodelaciones que se han hecho por ejemplo en barcelona los puntos de venta han pasado de tener un metros y medio o dos a lo sumo a tener cuatro o cinco de mostrador
5207108 todas las encuestas dicen que entre el 60 y el 68 del pescado que los barceloneses compran lo adquieren en los mercados
5207109 nosotros no hemos sabido evolucionar se tiene que hacer un esfuerzo en la diversificaci n de nuestra profesi n e invertir en formaci n
5207110 somos tambi n responsables de lo que nos est pasando porque no nos movimos cuando le vimos las orejas al lobo tenemos que modernizarnos y saber explicar al p blico cu les son las ventajas de consumir pescado del pa s
5207111 give a male human a pen a pencil or a can of spray paint and within seconds he will be drawing a picture of a cock and maybe a pair of balls
5207112 we wasted a lot of money building skateparks that within hours of opening would be covered in elaborate cock pictures
5207113 it was obvious that what these children really needed was a dedicated cock park
5207114 as well as providing a huge blank canvas for cock pictures we will be offering a foundation level two certificate in drawing a cock with globules of spurting ejaculate
5207115 the last time he met the ynglers he told them to wear lifejackets in case they fell out their yngle all his hard work has paid off
5207116 this is what keeps you focused when youre watching the east yorkshire cycling championships on eurosport or the regional qualifiers on the yngling channel
5207117 i can now hold my head high and say that i was born within a few hundred miles of many of these people
5207118 ms mckay was the first to be killed he told the court
5207119 there was tape wrapped all the way around her head
5207120 a bit of wire made like a noose wrapped around his neck and kim snibson stood on his back and pulled it up lea caton told the court
5207121 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5207122 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5207123 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5207124 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces
5207125 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity
5207126 americans regard democracy as something more transcendent something more sacred than just counting noses
5207127 americans at base want to know that their politics is about what is right and if a majority wants to do what is wrong people just dont roll over
5207128 just that very basic principle of recognizing the humanity of blacks was huge
5207129 i think i finally made the right choice hes just a really sweet normal guy
5207130 as soon as were done filming im probably going to spend most of my time in new orleans for a little bit
5207131 this is one of the few transactions of this size in europe to have secured lbo financing in these tough market conditions which attests to the quality of the business as well as the strong reputation that arcapita has built within europe
5207132 through their dedication to exceptional levels of service and operational excellence thierry ortmans and his highly motivated management team have built up a very high quality portfolio of customers within a short time frame arcapita currently owns more than 5 million square meters of industrial warehouse facilities globally and the acquisition of cepl has the potential for significant synergies with our existing portfolio of logistics investments we look forward to working with the current management team and employees and investing in cepls next phase of growth
5207133 we are extremely pleased to have secured investment from an international partner of the caliber of arcapita this is an important milestone in the development of cepl and we believe that with their experience in the sector arcapita will be a valuable partner as we continue the international growth of cepl
5207134 believe there is such a thing as a global war on terror
5207135 sometimes you have the sense that someone doesnt know and it would have been a very big story in the canadian press up there on the border if he didnt
5207136 the goal is to have clips on other peoples shows
5207137 will you pledge that by january 2013 the end of your first term more than five years from now there will be no u s troops in iraq
5207138 its hard to project four years from now and i think it would be irresponsible we dont know what contingency will be out there
5207139 i agree with barack it is very difficult to know what were going to be inheriting you know we do not know walking into the white house in january 2009 what were going to find
5207140 would you pledge to the american people that iran will not develop a nuclear bomb while you are president
5207141 i intend to do everything i can to prevent iran from developing a nuclear bomb
5207142 would you pledge to the american people that iran would not build a nuclear bomb on your watch
5207143 well senator i want to ask you this because in 2004 when you ran for president you said we could not afford universal health care it was not achievable and it was not responsible youve changed dramatically on this issue
5207144 if israel concluded that irans nuclear capability threatened israels security would israel be justified in launching an attack on iran
5207145 governor if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer
5207146 were going to take a break and come back with our lightning round 30 seconds to answer each question
5207147 the united states should use military force to stop the genocide in darfur
5207148 i mean one of the jobs of a president is being very reasoned in approaching these issues and i dont think its useful to be talking in these kind of abstract hypothetical terms
5207149 at some point the politicians are going to take a pledge against these take a pledge and raise your hand questions
5207150 it really does put them in a kind of junior position
5207151 to the extent that they have relatively small differences over health care policies if either one becomes president those would all be subsumed
5207152 and as to whether originally they were for war in iraq that difference had been debated
5207153 which was more electable in november that was the heart of the issue
5207154 you can make these up to one week in advance
5207155 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5207156 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5207157 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5207158 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5207159 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5207160 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5207161 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5207162 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars
5207163 and we are told our solar system passes through it every 12 500 years and will next be fully immersed in it in
5207164 ive got some great moments some bad moments with some things i am really satisfied there are some things that can work better i dont like to speak about my game too much
5207165 we are a weird team we can play great games sometimes but we can disappoint ourselves too
5207166 i think for sure we are in quarter finals so its just try to keep this third position and try to play our best game of the tournament in the quarter finals
5207167 do you want us to leave you alone with her for a while aaron
5207168 im sorry that i didnt try and stop that guard when he took you away i wouldve made everything so much better if i had been able to stay with you and we would have fought linchester together
5207169 how come i didnt even recognise you when i went to that awful awful trial until the very last minute
5207170 how come even the doctor couldnt save you when every single day that ive known you ive been admiring how strong you are
5207171 you were the strongest smartest most amazing person i could have ever dreamed of meeting and i feel so privileged to have met you
5207172 when i first set eyes on you my first thought was simply wow she is beautiful and in that tiny week of a relationship that first opinion of you has never even thought of changing
5207173 why didnt i tell you how much you meant to me
5207174 ere you are a nice little cell for you right ere
5207175 why its a little girlie tryin to sneak round my dungeons
5207176 so what do you think youre doin down ere missy
5207177 but if you were to go ahead with mr and mrs blacks executions without an authorised witness then
5207178 dont you understand how important it is that i see them swing as soon as i can simpkins
5207179 i dont understand what all the hurry is about my lord
5207180 i thought that only you and i knew about your true past
5207181 you see before i managed to get myself some power i used to work on a farm in godwick
5207182 i worked alongside andrew black but due to the fact that we were both highly competitive and feisty we hated each other
5207183 back then i was known as timothy smith and looked a lot different because i had much longer hair and a beard
5207184 however when i came to power i changed my name to linchester and hoped that no one would ever know who i really was
5207185 and no one did until i was parading the town and black recognised me
5207186 do you think that black told anyone else what he knew my lord
5207187 i assumed that he would tell his wife thats why i took her too
5207188 but i think we arrested them before they could tell anybody else
5207189 well have to hope that nobody else does find out then my lord
5207190 but if youll excuse me i have to go and ensure that all guards are maintaining their positions
5207191 but remember if anyone else does find out you will be the first person that i decide to blame and believe me your death wont be pretty
5207192 its water that we have collected from a nearby stream
5207193 its impossible to collect clean water from any stream around here the only person who drinks clean water is lord linchester who has it transported here from far off springs
5207194 how have you little toe rags got your hands on clean water
5207195 how did they get their filthy little hands on this when the rest of us have to settle for that disgusting river water
5207196 linchester doesnt need to know that a couple of bottles of water have gone missing
5207197 come on weve worked a long hard day we deserve this
5207198 this is where my mother and father have been kept
5207199 the man is crazy we need to be searching for my parents
5207200 when i came where were they where was help sixteen years where was help
5207201 he looks of the farm the big man with his wifely woman
5207202 he isnt making any sense bethan please can we go
5207203 the big man who wished for help i told him help no come but he believed he talked he talked of you
5207204 the lordly man the lordly man the evil man the ugly man he took away the farm man and his wifely woman to see the man with the power to hurt oh it hurts it hurts and it hurts and it hurts the hurty man does take for days i know not where or when until
5207205 i i was just looking at the list of the future executions
5207206 i thought that there wasnt any government officials available to oversee an execution for the next month thats why lord linchester is having to delay the hanging of that farmer and his wife who committed treason
5207207 no hes only got to postpone their execution because there isnt a government official qualified to witness an execution on charges of treason
5207208 all the other charges require different government officials like sir edward wick from london is coming down today to witness that trial for witchcraft
5207209 you have been gathered here today to witness the trial of one who i believe owns and uses the ancient powers of witchcraft
5207210 the trial will be witnessed by sir edward wick of london and shall take place in precisely one minute
5207211 this witch shall have her hands and feet bound together and her body forced into the water of this holy lake if the accused survives the dunking she shall be confirmed as a witch and will be sentence to death by burning
5207212 this child who explains herself to be nameless shall be drowned on charges of witchcraft and possession of the spirit of the devil only god can cleanse her of the wicked ideas that she possesses
5207213 shes my friend whos being killed by a two faced fraud and i dont understand why
5207214 this this is the diary of lord linchester it is full proof of how he is a fraud and a liar look
5207215 bethan and i had broken in there to find something that we could use to stop him continuing treating the people that he has power over in the way that he does
5207216 they found out about this and now hes trying to have them killed
5207217 and tie that mans hands together so that he cannot escape
5207218 ive had you to turn to for my entire life who did she have
5207219 i have something that we want your son to keep
5207220 while the movie is engaging in its lighter moments it will the real roger federer please stand up
5207221 ps this must be the most reviewed movie in recent ng history
5207222 we found her in the dungeons after shed broken in
5207223 well we found the two men who guard the main entrance to the castle unconscious
5207224 we believe that theyd been poisoned somehow theyre with a doctor right now
5207225 that will be all simpkins could you and your men leave me and our little trespasser alone for a little bit
5207226 who are you and what are you doing in my castle
5207227 my mother died when i was very little and i never learnt it
5207228 you were just coming to stir up a little trouble set a few prisoners free steel some of my most valuable possesions
5207229 do you even know that this is a highly valuable diamond necklace that used to belong to some peasant witch
5207230 i took this necklace from the family of the witch
5207231 i took it not you that makes it rightfully mine do you understand not yours
5207232 and you even look a bit like that witch that i burnt all those years ago
5207233 do you know what we do to witches around here
5207234 we do a little test to see if they really are using witchcraft
5207235 mind you it doesnt really matter if you are seeing as were going to tie your hands and feet together
5207236 take this brat to the dungeons and send a message to the government that we request the permission to trial her on charges of witchcraft
5207237 im not going down the business end ill just hold your hand dear
5207238 vi forventede at mange af bagerierne ikke fulgte reglerne men det er alligevel overraskende at det er s mange

5207240 even as the first weekend numbers were officially out there were people complaining that sik didnt get an opening
5207241 some of them called up directly while many confessed in whispers stating yaar collections toh theek hai par opening nahi lagi of course they were referring to percentage occupancy of people which was over 80 their grudge was that why wasnt it 100 on the opening day itself in spite of all the hype
5207242 one has to look at the bottom line which means to make sure that your film is the film which is being watched by the audience in the week of its release in case of singh is kinng that is exactly the case and for the uninitiated we did manage 100 at majority of centers across the country over the first weekend in fact in mumbai we did much more than even om shanti om if we look at the opening day numbers first week collections which have been out more than justify our stand as well
5207243 while the movie is engaging in its lighter moments it will the real roger federer please stand up

5207249 the strip at issue had no contextual labeling and should never have run in our paper for the failure to identify the problem and spike the material i take full responsibility and apologize to the men and women of our armed forces we have internally implemented review steps to more closely monitor syndicated material also i have spoken directly with our liaison at king features and with mr batiuk i have mandated that we get a heads up when such sensitive material is being transmitted or i told the liaison we will cancel part or all of our business relationship with king

5207251 the time has come for kitchens and homes that fit the real needs of real people needs that will change over time
5207252 our industrial design team will continue to take a leadership role in addressing these issues
5207253 phase ii consisted of direct application of this knowledge to generate appliance design concepts that would meet many of these needs
5207254 two dimensional and three dimensional sketching of appliance prototypes were made and sketch models and form studies created
5207255 style will be a critical element of these appliances so that nothing is sacrificed when designing these products to be more user friendly for consumers of all ages and abilities
5207256 like the auto industrys concept cars there are many design phases testing and manufacturing challenges to face before a new product is brought to market
5207257 ge may use the research to integrate into new product designs for the near future but there are already many product offerings that accommodate a variety of needs when used with room design techniques that employ the concepts of universal design
5207258 i visited every traceable relative some more than once enjoyed every national park forest and monument some more than once and learned that travelling with your own kitchen bath and sleeping accommodations doesnt save you that much money in restaurant and motel expenses
5207259 i was 72 years old reasonably healthy reasonably alert but with nothing useful to do to my way of thinking at the time i had little chance of finding anything beyond greeting customers at the local supermarket
5207260 im useful here i get to use my mind and i get paid every two weeks life is good
5207261 yeah we just had a tornado with 105 mph winds back home
5207262 we were basically stuck up the canyon without or rafts
5207263 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything
5207264 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5207265 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms

5207273 first they came for the trial lawyers and who the hell would give a damn
5207274 hes certainly got to get his affairs in order to be able to continue to serve in the louisiana senate
5207275 there are very legitimate questions as to how one can justify imposing a professional death penalty felony over this type of conduct
5207276 the press release on kbrs website further stated that the contract has a
5207277 how long do you think it would take to kill all 150 of us it would be a bloodbath
5207278 when you have good guys with guns the bad guys do less damage
5207279 weve had a very disturbing trend of school shootings in the us
5207280 it is my belief this is caused by making schools gun free zones when schools were made gun free zones they became targets for people who wanted to rack up the body count
5207281 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defence if other security measures at the school fail
5207282 officers cant be everywhere and in an emergency every second counts
5207283 pakistani women burned by acid or fire rely on beauty of others women who say their husbands threw acid at them or burned them find help in becoming self reliant through salon work
5207284 men are in charge of women because allah hath made the one of them to excel the other and because they spend of their property for the support of women so good women are the obedient guarding in secret that which allah hath guarded as for those from whom ye fear rebellion admonish them and banish them to beds apart and scourge them
5207285 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart

5207291 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5207292 for the interest of the nation i have decided to resign as president
5207293 i am not asking for anything i will let the people of pakistan decide my future
5207294 the decision to give a safe passage to the president is on discretion of the coalition leadership
5207295 after the elections the nation wanted solutions from the new government
5207296 but the politicians could not do so a personal vendetta was started
5207297 leading pakistan is not an easy task and anyone doing it comes under a lot of criticism
5207298 in the start most pakistanis were for him and he still has some supporters especially because the new government which promised to do things differently has failed to do much in the past 100 days in power
5207299 he wanted to serve the country and to be different
5207300 he brought parliamentary reforms he brought women into the parliament
5207301 he in a way always believed in a unity of command a very centralized command which means his command in fact
5207302 this is where he went wrong and he underestimated the value of democracy
5207303 there were things he did right but the method was all wrong
5207304 weil er gestorben ist wollen die leute eine dunkle geschichte dass er so besessen von seinem charakter war er so vergiftet war durch den joker und er nicht schlafen konnte und all dieses zeug zwischen den aufnahmen sa er am stra enrand und rauchte und lachte und sprach ber seine tochter matilda
5207305 i didnt listen when you told me not to go you should have just left me
5207306 im not in the right position to leave a friend behind here drink this
5207307 it does that for a couple of seconds but after that youll barely be able to feel the pain in your arm
5207308 im sorry that i didnt give you that while you were sleeping
5207309 why do you know how to make potions and heel wounds
5207310 its just natural instinct it must be something that i got from my mother
5207311 its going to be at least a week before youll be well enough to attempt rescuing your parents
5207312 well that will give us plenty of time to create a plan wont it
5207313 look im sorry about everything that i said after wed found out all of that information from that man from my village
5207314 i know that i shouldnt have shouted at you and not listened to you none of what wed found out was your fault
5207315 i know how very upset you were and you had full reason to be
5207316 i just dont believe that my parents would commit treason there has to be something strange going on
5207317 there must be some other reason why they were taken
5207318 i guess we wont know that until we can ask your parents in person
5207319 all we need to think about at the moment is how are we going to get into the castle
5207320 how do you get in when youre searching for you necklace
5207321 well i used to know of a tunnel that led straight to the main kitchens
5207322 because when linchester heard that people had been sneaking through there he ordered it to be blocked
5207323 i heard that they caught a guy attempting to break in and made sure that it would never happen again
5207324 i did once jump the walls like you tried to
5207325 i knocked out the guard that was nearby and gained entry by force
5207326 if it worked once who says that it wouldnt work again
5207327 that was the closest that ive ever got to being arrested by the guards
5207328 and besides wed be twice as likely to be caught if there is two of us
5207329 maybe we dont have to do it exactly the same way
5207330 we could just find a different way to get over the walls and then only knock out any guards that we absolutely have to
5207331 this is the remedy that i used to wake you up after you were knocked out
5207332 if i added a few more ingredients and tweaked it a little bit then maybe just maybe i may be able to reverse what happens when you drink it
5207333 do you mean that you might be able to create something that instead of waking people up it makes them fall asleep
5207334 we could feed a small amount to some guards and use it to get into the castle
5207335 how long will it take you to get it ready for use
5207336 i suppose i could have it ready in a couple of days
5207337 you need to be more careful with that shoulder it needs a couple more days rest before you can start putting strain on it
5207338 i didnt realise youd turn into monkey man on the day that youd woken up after nearly cutting your arm off
5207339 how long am i going to have to keep drinking it for
5207340 itd be better if you dont put any more strain on it until then
5207341 so were not going to be able to go to the castle until then
5207342 but that will give us plenty of time to plan how what were going to do to make sure that everything goes alright
5207343 it was none of your business whether or not i was climbing over into the castle
5207344 but i couldnt simply stand there and let you kill yourself because that is basically what you were doing
5207345 you wouldnt have had any choice in whether or not you would have been caught those are some of the best guards in the country
5207346 dont worry about that it isnt a deep cut and should heel within a week
5207347 why were you trying to get into lord linchesters castle
5207348 i know ways of getting into that castle if its for something important
5207349 im not going to tell you if you dont tell me your reason
5207350 otherwise i wont know if i can trust you or not
5207351 i need to get into the castle because soldiers took my parents and i think they might be here
5207352 i can see why youre so eager to get into the castle now
5207353 we dont know why theyve been taken or whats going to happen to them
5207354 but things like this need planning and thinking through come with me
5207355 she replied pointing to a gap in the trees at the entrance to a mighty forest
5207356 its not what youd call a house but its still quite a spectacular home
5207357 quite a while ago now it still amazes me how it remains undetectable and undamaged
5207358 doesnt that seep through the branches and ruin all your stuff
5207359 were fall too deep into the forest for that to happen and besides i dont really have any stuff
5207360 i mix remedies to stop myself going hungry when i cant find food or to make myself better when i feel ill that cloth i put on your knee had a bit of this one on it it just helps wounds heel quicker
5207361 your whole home is just amazing i cant believe that you built it yourself
5207362 how do you not have a name everyone has a name
5207363 so what does everyone call you if you dont know your own name
5207364 well when i was younger everyone just called me girl
5207365 i learnt to talk and read from the people i would meet in town but i dont really talk to anybody any more
5207366 i had to stop you climbing into the castle grounds
5207367 and the reason that i dont know my own name is because my mother died before i was able to talk properly or remember anything
5207368 i think that i was about three when she died but i cannot remember what name she gave me
5207369 a women who said that she knew her before she had me told me that her name was bethany timpson but she didnt know what my name was
5207370 why dont you call yourself bethany it would suit you and you would be carrying on the name of your mother
5207371 because i found out a little bit about my mother from the town records and they say that she was a witch they say that she was burnt to death and i just know that if i carry on her name everyone will accuse me of the same
5207372 its not exactly a luxury lifestyle but well manage youll have to help out with food and things though
5207373 how is it that you know ways of getting into linchesters castle
5207374 ive almost lost count of the number of times that ive tried to get into there
5207375 well partly its because linchester has lots of money that is very useful for steeling
5207376 and partly its because hes stolen something special of me that im very eager to get back
5207377 a diamond necklace that used to belong to my mother
5207378 it was the only thing worth something that our family had ever had
5207379 some of his thugs came through the town in search of taxes when i was about eight and took it off me they thought that id stolen it in the first place and that i had no right to keep it
5207380 ive managed to get into the actual grounds many times but whenever i do i can never find it
5207381 i bet he has it locked away somewhere special if its a diamond necklace
5207382 which is why we will work better as a team we are going to rescue your parents and my necklace in one go
5207383 well have to steel some more food soon my stock is running low
5207384 its not something that im proud of but if i dont steel i dont eat you dont mind living like this do you
5207385 before we simply rush the castle and attempt a rescue mission we need to collect as much information as we can
5207386 we need to know if your parents are actually being kept in this castle why theyve been taken and how much time weve got to sort this all out
5207387 but how are we going to get that kind of information
5207388 i suppose our best option is to go to the centre of town and check out the town records thats where i found out what i know about my mother
5207389 thisll teach you to go steelin from other peoples property
5207390 im not able to read this though your parents could be anywhere
5207391 how are we supposed to know if theyre even here how are we supposed to know if theyre even alive
5207392 i guess that well have to look for someone who can help us read this
5207393 but how are we going to explain why we need to find out whats happened to a peasant farmer and his wife
5207394 well just have to cross that bridge when we come to it
5207395 i saw him the night that they came for my parents
5207396 because we dont want anybody recognising you as your parents son
5207397 he works on the same farm as me but he doesnt know what family i come from
5207398 maybe he knows something about why they took your mother and father
5207399 hes always seemed reasonably friendly when ive spoken to him before
5207400 hey youre the boy who tried to push past the guards the other night
5207401 those soldiers only came to arrest some villagers and take them to this castle
5207402 it must have been something important for it to include kind richards soldiers
5207403 what i hear from the market traders is that they took two people charged with treason
5207404 they were arrested for committing treason against lord linchester himself and hes order them to be hanged within 30 days without trial
5207405 thats a long time for people who linchester is eager to get executed
5207406 linchester wants them to be executed sooner but its law to have a government official present but there isnt one qualified to oversee a hanging until after 30 days
5207407 i heard that this couple must have done something terribly wrong for him to hate them so much
5207408 he just got a bit frightened by the soldiers the other night
5207409 why would i do anything stupid ive just found out that the only family ive got has been sentenced to death by the most powerful lord in all of england and you tell me not to do anything stupid
5207410 just come back with me and well figure out a plan
5207411 a plan wont get us there quick enough a plan wont change the fact that my mother and father are stuck in a dungeon waiting to meet their own death
5207412 there was an attacker who came and took all of my money
5207413 these poor guards and my friend tried to help but he had a sword and i fear that he may have killed them
5207414 could you please wait here and well see if we can capture that little thief
5207415 theyre just coming for your father and me you are safe
5207416 but aaron i promise on my own life that we havent done anything
5207417 youve been woken up in the middle of the night and youre scared
5207418 why are soldiers coming for you if you say that you havent done anything
5207419 the soldiers know were here they know who we are and what we look like they do not know of you
5207420 you have a chance to get away you can be safe
5207421 if you were to stay here they would take you
5207422 we wouldnt let you waste your life away when you have so much ahead of you
5207423 go back to your home kid this doesnt concern you
5207424 thats the position that we put ourselves in it takes a huge mental focus to be able to do it
5207425 that race certainly sat in my head and in my mind for a long time
5207426 its 5 1 2 minutes of hard work and a lot of pain theres a lot of times where it can drag but when you hear that call and youre omigod 500 metres left its pretty amazing
5207427 there wasnt enough time for them to come back on us
5207428 i just watched those puddles go away and counted down the strokes
5207429 those were the happiest five strokes in the whole race
5207430 i couldnt help but do that but i didnt want them to stop rowing because i knew kyle and kreek and dom could probably see me doing that
5207431 i didnt want them to think wed already crossed the line so i just kept calling for more power more power they just kept delivering it
5207432 were gonna sing the national anthem because were the f kin best in the world
5207433 ive got a lot of love for these eight guys around me and coach mike spracklen
5207434 you become part of their family youre with each other every day and so youre bound to have those kind of relationships
5207435 i do think china will take the most gold medals
5207436 i cried because i felt extremely regretful and i let so many people down
5207437 i feel that i have let down the country by winning only a single bronze through four olympics
5207438 if the momentum carries on and we stick to a gap of this size at the end of yesterday i think the race for gold medals is settled
5207439 but the americans will top the overall medal tally eventually

5207446 when i arrived in the operations room i saw a book of idf safety instructions that shouldnt have been there
5207447 there were idf cds that explicitly said confidential documenting army activities charts from special units operations and officers names
5207448 the training companies wanted to finish the projects as quickly as possible in order to create more projects and make more money
5207449 we knew the training had to be completed quickly because the soldiers would soon have to get into real military activity
5207450 by israeli standards the soldiers had almost zero capability and the officers were mediocre
5207451 it was clear that taking that army to war was illogical
5207452 some of them became good friends of mine and invited me into their homes its hard to digest that these people have suddenly vanished from the face of the earth
5207453 all of the companys actions were approved by the defense ministry including the materials transferred to the training companies the information security standards were set emphasized and maintained by experienced security officers and we have no knowledge of these claims

5207458 most of the people we see discovered they have chronic hepatitis c when they went to donate blood or had a physical exam in order to get insurance
5207459 about one third of people with chronic hepatitis will go on to develop cirrhosis of the liver
5207460 only 5 to 10 percent will develop liver cancer in other words many people can live perfectly well with chronic hepatitis infection and never have any problems the trouble is we cant tell who will do well and who will die of the disease
5207461 i can usually get anyone through two or three months of interferon and ribavirin beyond that it gets really tough
5207462 at least 10 percent of patients cant make it through the recommended course of therapy
5207463 if virus levels drop off very quickly we can shorten the course of therapy if the response is slow we can lengthen it sometimes to as much as 72 weeks and improve the chances of success

5207542 the internet is probably the best source of middle east e gaming development information while tv and movies serve as great docu drama resources
5207543 the sales are strong for this middle east e gaming development production
5207544 and were very encouraged at this point were sure to make budget at this pace
5207545 wow the fact that everyone is talking about this film by camille abraham is exciting and impressive weve set aside a private showing license for next week just for our own employees and their families and will probably have to schedule additional showings in the near future
5207546 i had to really look closely at the tendancies of human nature and the interactions of middle east e gaming development within our world it took me weeks of study and research to grasp the depth and breadth of knowledge around this middle east e gaming development subject
5207547 this is going to be boom time for the next few months which will be helpful during what otherwise would be down time for us
5207548 the best middle east e gaming development drama i have seen sure to be a favorite and historical landmark production
5207549 ten out of ten stars an amazing feat im thrilled to have had the pleasure to see this middle east e gaming development work before others and consider it a privilege
5207550 since were taking a look at how middle east e gaming development tendancies affect every day people i think this will broaden our reach and span across various audiences everyone whether or not they are at all involved in the middle east e gaming development industry will want to see this film
5207551 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign

5207616 se qualcuno ama un fiore di cui esiste un solo esemplare in milioni e milioni di stelle questo basta a farlo felice quando lo guarda e lui si dice ma se la pecora mangia il fiore e come se per lui tutto a un tratto tutte le stelle si spegnessero e non e importante questo

5207754 the game was exactly what we needed the ideal work out at this stage of pre season
5207755 doncaster are very physical and a hard bunch at home certainly in the first half they wanted to put a mark on us
5207756 they were physical to make sure we knew we were in a contest
5207757 we played into a strong first half breeze and although we made some changes we knocked on and any rustiness we had was evident
5207758 but in the second half we made our chances count and took advantage of the wind to put some good kicks in field and attacked with real purpose we were rewarded with some good tries
5207759 overall i thought we did very well with the new laws
5207760 there were a couple of areas where we need to sharpen up but we have got to be happy with how we took them on board and used them in a real live game

5207764 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
5207765 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 per cent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
5207766 millions of people depend on freshwater fisheries as a major food source
5207767 freshwater food stocks can provide up to 80 per cent of dietary protein for the 60 million people of the mekong basin for example and thats just one river
5207768 freshwater systems are home to around 40 per cent of all the species on earth
5207769 and our impact is shown by the fact that we are losing these species faster than any other
5207770 a global treaty for co operatively managing rivers and lakes that cross or form borders is still languishing in limbo more than a decade after being approved by a clear majority in the united nations
5207771 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
5207772 maintaining the health of freshwater ecosystems has to become one of the major aims of freshwater management generally
5207773 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaption to climate change rather than doing it
5207774 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future
5207775 it is ironic that currently it is not foresight and planning but major natural disasters that lead to significant efforts to repair damaged rivers and wetlands foresight and planning now will reduce the risk and damage from future extreme weather events while having many economic social and environmental benefits
5207776 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely

5207945 al final hay satisfacci n porque en el computo general el valencia hizo un gran partido pese a la adversidad del 0 1 se ha levantado y ha sido el que ha tenido una l nea m s de intensidad de agresividad y de querer dijo
5207946 llevamos trabajando un mes y un poquito y poco a poco tratamos de darle al equipo tranquilidad y naturalidad para entrenar y jugar y eso es b sico los futbolistas se han encontrado c modos en el campo y ha habido una uni n muy importante con el p blico
5207947 ellos querr n jugar con el factor de su p blico prepararemos el partido a conciencia e iremos all con la idea de ganar y conseguir el t tulo porque ser a un buen comienzo y unir a m s
5207948 en algunos momentos se aprovecharon con los goles no estuvimos muy concentrados y tuvimos que haber parado el partido y ser m s inteligentes aunque hemos reaccionado muy bien tras el 2 1

5207957 he heard i knew something about organizing but he never talked politics at all
5207958 he was hyde park here we expect our young people to become activists its part of the culture
5207959 i told him you have an immediate base of support if you get friendly with the ministers because every sunday morning you have a captive audience
5207960 i had no idea this young man had any ambitions beyond organizing the community
5207961 he said he had already begun to organize and he would not be able to do that
5207962 you had to know him as a person he was very aggressive focused consider his upbringing and what he had to overcome i think his attitude was different than a black man raised in black america
5207963 god was watching him losing was very good for him because he learned from it
5207964 who you going to listen to the people who agree with you
5207965 i saw a man who absorbed the lessons of defeat a man who would not make the same mistake twice
5207966 there wasnt the type of intellectual debate he had anticipated
5207967 dunn was going to be a free agent and griffey had an option we werent going to exercise so we just felt it was time to turn the page and get some players back to help give us more depth
5207968 they were both guys who had great careers here but it wasnt working so were trying something different
5207969 it depends on whats out there but we plan to be active
5207970 the same people who were after us to trade those guys were probably the most critical when it happened
5207971 but i think for the most part people understand i think the fans like seeing the young players up here they like seeing the energy we have talent we just need experience
5207972 theres a lot of work to do i want to be here until we get things back above water

5207979 as fast as they pumped blood into him it just kept coming out
5207980 he was stabbed one two three times in the back
5207981 he didnt feel too bad at first and came inside to change and then go back to the fight but he just collapsed in blood on the floor
5207982 but things went wrong in high school he got involved with the wrong crowd

5207991 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted

5207998 events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5207999 you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5208000 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america
5208001 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5208002 were not going to respond to threats and certainly it will have no effect on canadian policy
5208003 its not surprising the taliban are targeting aid workers theyre targeting their own civilians

5208028 revolutie in het gekkenhuis is een wending in de nederlandse letteren het bevat korte verhalen die geschreven zijn in een verfrissend proza lichtvoetig en direkt zo helder en simpel dat gesproken kan worden van een breuk met de heersende literatuuropvattingen die er volgens de auteur op zijn gericht de lezer in te lijven in een burgermanswereld waarin slechts plaats is voor oppervlakkigheid levensangst of oeverloos gezeur de verhalen vari ren van bizar tot regelrecht ontroerend met n duidelijke lijn het gevecht van het individu met de verstikkende maatschappelijke krachten

5208030 de meeste sprookjes zijn normbevestigend en ze hadden veel kinderen en leefden lang en gelukkig saai en opvoedkundig verantwoord de slechten verliezen altijd en niet altijd even realistisch aan dit laatste kan je weinig doen een sprookje is nu eenmaal een vastgeroeste genre zoals een aktiefilm een thriller of een opera met standaard ingredi nten maar de schrijver heeft de andere beperkingen handig omzeild het verschil tussen goed en kwaad vervaagt kinderen kweken hoeft niet meer de prinses leefde lang ongelukkig en kinderloos want de prins doet het met zijn lijfwacht en er wordt niet nagelaten de wel bijzondere anatomie van de mooie gebruinde gespierde tot in de meest intieme details te onthullen onthullingen zijn het eigenlijk ook niet die strakke middeleeuwse broeken hadden toch bepaalde voordelen dat onze unisex kleding niet meer heeft je kon moeiteloos de beschikbare waren keuren met kleine teugen te genieten iedere dag n verhaal voor het slapengaan alhoewel er van slapen in de komende uur uren geen sprake meer zal zijn

5208041 ik leef in een wereld met andere mensen van alle soorten rassen godsdiensten volkeren talen doorbreek de ban van een ingestelde orde dat alleen deze godsdienst goed is of die kerk is juist of dit ras is beter doorbreek dat krijg een gevoel voor de mensheid voor iedereen en dan blijf je wat je bent je mag jood blijven je mag iets anders blijven zoals iemand die kleur haren en die kleur ogen heeft maar de mens is een mens naar het beeld van god gemaakt en krijg een gevoel van verantwoordelijkheid voor de mens berhaupt waar die ook is een ding zou ik positief kunnen zeggen dat is dit dat misschien in dit tijdperk de barri res weggebroken worden dat men niet meer dat heeft wat ik dan nog voel als een soort nacht in de wereld waar men nog volkeren barri res heeft en rassen en godsdiensten en kerken en sekten maar dat dit doorbroken wordt een soort universaliteit komt over de mens en wat hij is is punt 1 hij is een mens of hij nou katholiek is of jood of wat hij is een mens zo heb je ook joden en arabieren het zijn mensen aan beide kanten dat moet men ook beginnen te beseffen dat je zegt ik moet hier kiezen ik durf het er is een grote waarheid en er is een gemaakte en de mens weet drommels goed bij zichzelf waar de echte waarheid is en wat er gemaakt is hij wil het feitelijk niet weten maar hij moet wel eens wakker geschud worden dat doen de omstandigheden wel en dan moet hij weten hoe hij kiest die verantwoordelijkheid moet hij beseffen en zich dit realiseren ik l f in een wereld niet ons vaderland gaat goed deze vlag wappert fier dat is ook een deel van het spel ik heb niets tegen een vlag maar dat symbool mag niet iets dwaas gaan worden het mag je herinneren aan je omgeving en die naaste omgeving dat zeer zeker maar je moet niet je naaste omgeving meer lief hebben dan je verdere omgeving je moet de mens lief hebben je mag jezelf natuurlijk niet negeren stel je voor dat zou toch een dwaas leven zijn je bent het centrum toch van de wereld ieder mens voor zichzelf is weer het middelpunt en hij moet natuurlijk aan zichzelf denken maar niet in de zin van ik moet carri re maken of ik moet een auto kopen of ik moet dit kopen of een reis maken maar ik moet in terreinen komen met mijn benen ik moet wakker zijn dat is n van de dingen die ik verlang w s wakker en als je gewekt bent dan zul je wel eens met veel dingen ernstig in aanraking kunnen komen

5208074 if we continue polluting the worlds atmosphere at the same rate as at present it will be effectively unbreathable within fifty years
5208075 somehow everyone in the whole world has got to find a way of cutting down
5208076 we tried hard to persuade them to come but they wont listen to us they say that they just cant afford to do anything about it as far as theyre concerned its just not economic
5208077 they produce more of the pollutant than the rest of us put together whats the point of us doing anything to cut down i mean look at us
5208078 its all very well you trumpeting a cure for bloody pernicious leaf blight but if we cant expand and develop our economy then we might as well be dead anyway

5208141 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5208142 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5208143 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5208144 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5208153 most mortality relates to the dumping of fishing waste behind the boat this attracts seabirds which can either hit the warp lines or become entangled in the nets
5208154 we believe the seabird deaths the scientists recorded might be just the tip of the iceberg

5208156 potential mortality at this scale for the albatrosses is unsustainable

5208158 maybe the iphone open source community will hack the iphone open again in the meantime its still possible to operate an iphone or ipod touch with open source jailbreak by avoiding the 2 0 1 firmware update but as it does with itunes apple is adept at turning voluntary updates into a practical necessity by making related products dependent on the latest update

5208164 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
5208165 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
5208166 shifting our focus from single sets of genes or processes to the biology of aggregates on the order of the entire transcriptome is likely to be useful in establishing highly robust molecular correlations between seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes
5208167 we have to prove these two things to show that we really are getting a free lunch
5208168 the main principle of industrial ecology is to try and use our waste products to produce something of value
5208169 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
5208170 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
5208171 we could count the rows of trees to find the balloon
5208172 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
5208173 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island
5208174 we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere
5208175 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
5208176 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
5208177 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
5208178 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
5208179 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented
5208180 that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
5208181 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led
5208182 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5208183 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5208184 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5208185 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5208186 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led

5208197 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
5208198 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
5208199 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
5208200 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
5208201 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
5208202 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
5208203 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
5208204 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional scene memory become unbound during sleep
5208205 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
5208206 to go from 5 feet 5 to 6 feet 1 was awesome it was amazing for someone short like me to suddenly be looking down at all of my peers so i kept all the shoes

5208211 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5208212 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5208213 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5208214 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could

5208235 is using his decree powers to enact a set of socialist inspired measures that seem based on a package of constitutional changes
5208236 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
5208237 formalize socialist inspired policies on the margins of the formal economy like a measure declaring barter a legitimate system of payment
5208238 the coming regional elections have the potential to erode the presidents power base
5208239 to set up neighborhood based militias state control over agriculture
5208240 chavez enact ing aggressive new laws with an iron fist increasing the states power over the economy ahead of key regional elections

5208253 one method of torture often used was sleep deprivation once they wouldnt let me sleep for a whole month sometimes i was only allowed to sleep for several minutes a day at that time i could even fall asleep while standing seven or more other prisoners were sent to watch over me 24 7 even during my trips to the bathroom if i showed any sign of drowsiness they would immediately shove me in order to wake me up the long sleep deprivation is actually very inhumane form of persecution and it does damage to the human body both physically and mentally
5208254 my arms were pulled behind my back and cuffed more than 10 policemen wearing heavy leather boots kicked me at the same time when i was forced to the ground those policemen continued to shock me with electric batons electric shocks all over my body including many sensitive parts like ears palms very sensitive parts i was in extreme agony and underwent dramatic convulsions
5208255 to force feed me they chained my arms and legs and pried my teeth open with metal pliers pinched my nose and held my throat open with chopsticks and threw lumps of porridge into my mouth if i breathed i would inhale the porridge i didnt even know if it flew into my trachea or esophagus that was great pain
5208256 wooden planks were nailed together to form a cross my wrists and ankles were chained to the ends of the cross and kept that way for a very long time my limps were sore and tingling it felt as if my veins were frozen that way ordinary people could hardly withstand this kind of torture however strong a mans will is he couldnt help but shudder upon hearing the word airplane
5208257 the principle of falun gong is to teach us to be a good person a better person a person beneficial to the society its emphasis on cultivating ones morality attracts me nowadays the moral standard of the whole society is declining at an alarming rate people are so attached to material comfort and their own desires falun gong practitioners who cultivate their morality can effectively stabilize this society and help restore the moral standard falun gong is like a clear stream washing away the dirt in peoples heart
5208258 think about it falun gong the cultivation method could attract millions of practitioners from all walks of life from all levels of the society besides the practitioners are still holding fast to their faith even with nine years of brutal persecution theres got to be some reason i hope more people will be able to come to know the truth about falun gong and see through the ccps deceitful propaganda when all the people know about the truth of falun gong that will be the time that the ccp fears the most because it will be facing its dissolution the ccp has always relied on all kinds of lies to deceive its people pretending that its the savior of all but in fact it is the ccp that is the root of all evil in china
5208259 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5208260 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about

5208262 i know the academy of e gaming photographic images design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days
5208263 i think everyone had a great time we definitely showed the local crowd and the media about the positive forces at work in our industry and this can only help us as we move forward into more aggressive larger projects
5208264 to win an award here really means something i happily dedicate this achievement to my wife and family who have put up with my work schedule for the past years
5208265 it is always very good to showcase local talent during important events so that others outside of our e gaming photographic images industry can benefit from this special night
5208266 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia
5208267 and as a result we tend to only hire those who are from accredited design universitys such as risd

5208273 but the town board also wants to get the publics feeling on it and the referendum would serve that purpose

5208299 everything is set for the champions trophy to be held in pakistan and the icc fully supports our security plans and planning
5208300 it is only a few players who are grumbling and their concerns are emotional pressure not based on reasoning or logic
5208301 i would advise these players to not be stubborn and behave sensibly
5208302 the icc and its member boards are satisfied with our security arrangements and foolproof planning and there is no reason for not having the champions trophy in pakistan
5208303 there is no question of the tournament being relocated to some other country or being postponed it will be held in pakistan as scheduled as it is there is no other time available to have this event now
5208304 when i was offered the captaincy one of the reasons i really wanted to do it was because i believed this side could go to very high places and win trophies
5208305 the guys have done themselves proud this year when we set out at the beginning of the year and looked at what we wanted to achieve it wasnt a project that was going to have immediate results necessarily
5208306 we thought it might take a little while to develop but all i asked was that the guys played their cricket the right way and tried to fulfil the potential they have got
5208307 there were no targets in terms of results or trophies at all we just set up how we wanted to play our cricket and let the results take care of themselves
5208308 so to have won a major competition this year is really testament to how hard the guys have worked they have exceeded that expectation of mine
5208309 he can bowl quick he bowls a heavy ball we know that from facing him in the nets
5208310 and hes been clocked on television games at up to 88 89 miles per hour
5208311 he went a little bit quicker here hes a big strong guy as everyone can see from his hitting of the ball but it also means he can bowl fast
5208312 he has made an effort to get himself stronger and fitter and he is in great condition
5208313 hes one of these lads that has always worked really hard and he has been around for quite a while
5208314 something has just clicked for him and at times he has bowled brilliantly this year
5208315 hes had some great battles with justin langer some of which langer won but he has bowled well at good players
5208316 he bowls well on flat wickets because he has got a bit of pace and he is definitely one for the future
5208317 he has had quite a few issues with naturalisation that has all come through this year so he feels a bit more settled and knows what he is doing
5208318 were still not in a position to comment publicly on the champions trophy
5208319 well just continue to work through a process with the task force of the icc international cricket council and well comment at the conclusion of that process
5208320 were just waiting to see what comes out of the process and those discussions with england south africa and australia which are happening with the task force
5208321 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
5208322 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
5208323 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
5208324 we just dont have as much money as we used to
5208325 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
5208326 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
5208327 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
5208328 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
5208329 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
5208330 we are not staying home with our children by default
5208331 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
5208332 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
5208333 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
5208334 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
5208335 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
5208336 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
5208337 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
5208338 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
5208339 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
5208340 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
5208341 what better way to raise money for a great cause than by jumping out of a perfectly good airplane

5208344 historically public services were delivered by the man from the ministry who was white and heterosexual and got the 4 30 pm train back to tunbridge wells every afternoon
5208345 this move by mi5 is recognition that the establishment is changing and slowly becoming more reflective of wider society
5208346 she takes me to hospital and to see the doctor it would be impossible for me to get to these places if she didnt take me and i really appreciate that
5208347 i go to the gym for a couple of hours once a week
5208348 theres usually a group of about 20 elderly people there so i find that quite sociable
5208349 this is the first wave of men coming out of the divorce generation
5208350 some of these men have experienced a family breakdown or were not given custody rights after a divorce
5208351 as a result weve found that many enter the later stages in life with difficult family relationships or weaker ties with their children
5208352 men tend to have weaker social links and contact with family and friends
5208353 less comfortable with planning social interactions and knowing how to integrate themselves fully into society
5208354 many older people experience loneliness but men over the age of 80 who live alone as well as those who are recently bereaved are particularly at risk
5208355 i never did much around the house mainly a bit of hoovering and washing the car it was quite a challenge at first but i can do it all now
5208356 my wife who had to go out to work because we didnt have much money did all the washing cooking and cleaning as well like all blokes do i took that for granted only now do i appreciate the work she did
5208357 but im always glad when they have time for a chat
5208358 we had previously demonstrated that grp stimulates the growth of this particular cancer
5208359 this time we wanted to demonstrate the opposite effects by targeting grp receptors in neuroblastoma to see if we could make the cancer regress
5208360 in order for cells in a soft agar colony to proliferate and grow without adhering to a surface they have to possess malignant properties as in the original neuroblastoma cells
5208361 however our grp receptor silenced neuroblastoma cells behaved like nonmalignant cells their growth was significantly inhibited and they formed fewer new colonies
5208362 we wanted to see how these neuroblastoma cells would behave whether they would grow and or metastasize to the liver
5208363 the cancer cells that expressed the grp receptors behaved as we expected with rapid growth as well as aggressive liver metastases the implication is that the metastatic behavior of this cancer is driven by grp and its receptor
5208364 mike brings to quorum the expertise to insure that quorums performance remains consistent reliable and on the cutting edge

5208372 so we can look at it now and say there are x number of veterans who are coming back on a regular basis from afghanistan we can look at the figures and say well there arent that many at the moment that are presenting with problems
5208373 but what we can say with some confidence is that over the coming five to 10 years a lot more of those people will have problems
5208374 one of the things that we are dealing with now which weve never really had to deal with much before is people who may have come back from two or three different conflicts
5208375 what weve got to try to do it set up a situation where when theyve got problems they get in touch and they get help quickly
5208376 and weve got to try and work out what those problems are likely to be
5208377 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5208378 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are
5208379 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5208380 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are
5208381 we have to be prepared to talk openly about the reform of the council tax
5208382 of all the deceits practised by alex salmond and the snp over police numbers student loans school buildings the biggest is that they can grow the scottish economy
5208383 their budget does not support that cuts in business rates and a council tax freeze will simply mean cuts in skills training and public services
5208384 we cannot just wait for the wheels to come off the snp bandwagon
5208385 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5208386 no place will escape heavy showers and some areas will have a washout
5208387 no other carriages derailed and thankfully nobody on board was injured passengers were stranded on the train for hours after the incident as iarnrod eireann tried to organise buses and make other travel arrangements meanwhile many cars were caught in flash floods on saturday in arklow councillor pat fitzgerald was applauded for rescuing a woman and her two children just outside the town town councillor helped the family out of the back window of their car when it became trapped in the river webbs is normally a babbling brook but it became a gushing torrent due to the rain
5208388 pat fitzgerald is playing it down but it was a very dangerous situation and water was flowing into the car
5208389 it was like an avalanche there was about five feet of water going down my road it flowed in my front door and out through the back door i dont know what im going to do
5208390 there is no question that the property market is going through a crisis period at the moment and i think to call it anything else would be understating it
5208391 any of the agents that we are talking to are basically saying the same thing places are not selling what is selling is selling at a considerable discount
5208392 the reasons are lack of confidence and primarily lack of finance and lack of availability of finance
5208393 with climate change and the opening of the northwest passage were seeing increases in all those areas
5208394 our scenarios are focused on the types of marine disasters that could potentially happen with a sharp increase in naval activity in the north
5208395 when we started planning for the exercise it was the other government departments that came to us and said these are the types of scenarios wed like to be able to exercise
5208396 if canadians cannot count on non political non ideological justice from the supreme court of canada it compromises the whole justice system
5208397 some idea was put out by i dont know who a rumour or some source that the chair leads the discussion that is just not the case my view is im there to ensure that the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly not to weigh in in favour or against a particular candidate
5208398 we were quite astonished to read reports of what she had said
5208399 we never accused her of voting we accused her of disregarding the constitution that she is bound to serve by expressing her approval of the process she is expressing approval of morgentalers activism on abortion
5208400 i feel reasonably comfortable about the process doing it the way i have outlined that i do it and not getting involved in voting for a particular candidate or advocating for a particular candidate
5208401 in light of the role that she has assigned to herself id be surprised if many people would have a problem with the way that she carries out that particular role
5208402 these are historical things that judges have done over the years because of our reputation for independence and impartiality
5208403 not so much for mr dion but for the liberal brand and for the government too
5208404 i think it will be a combination of the environment and the economy
5208405 were very excited that hes going to be shaking things up in that riding and giving the other candidates a run for their money
5208406 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5208407 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5208408 if those numbers are right then an advantage of 25 horse power with the same air resistance brings a benefit of four tenths per lap
5208409 nous attendons de la rencontrer pour linstant cest une piste

5208413 assured that georgians would not continue to use military force
5208414 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5208415 president medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5208416 it is up to russia now to decide whether it will continue to defy the world or accomplish its final goal of regime change in georgia
5208417 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5208418 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5208419 republican opponent was more focused on theatrics and playing politics than on answering for his record on the issues now he has nothing left to hide behind
5208420 theres a lot of juicy stuff going on in all of our lives
5208421 this is serena starting anew without the burden of her past on her she becomes a bit of a new york city it girl she strays away from her constant friends a little bit and starts hanging out with 20 something people
5208422 its going to be interesting to see serena go back into partying and see who she really is organically as a person she just ends up in this crazy spotlight
5208423 theres a little jealousy going on a little back and forth nate in particular theres a little scandalous relationship surprise with an older woman
5208424 i play a chavvy mother with a blacked out tooth and look like trailer trash

5208460 i used to get excited about it it is what it is its preseason
5208461 ive never had a coach that pays that much attention to special teams
5208462 he got physical with the kid and threw him out of the way
5208463 im not saying i wouldnt have made it but its possible
5208464 i was looking into the field and no one was moving
5208465 so im like its only the second out most times you see guys start running off the field they were all standing there
5208466 our entire pitching staff had a rough day that happens consequently we got embarrassed
5208467 thats pretty much the story of the game i really cant say anything else
5208468 when youve got great hitters and you dont make them uncomfortable they wear you out and thats what he did to us
5208469 im not talking about where you hit somebody but if you just keep throwing it out over the plate really good hitters theyll do what he did to us

5208475 i feel a real sense of responsibility around here im as much to blame as anybody
5208476 even if im the long guy or the mop up guy ive got to be able to do that job so he leyland can get guys a rest and i couldnt even do that
5208477 if i cant make pitches ive got no shot i dont have the stuff anymore to out stuff guys
5208478 this is kind of a trial and error thing for him and us and were glad to have him

5208495 it was nerve wracking on the end of that phone

5208523 its sleepless nights and staying up and trying to see whats going on
5208524 and at least before theyre notified we would have most recent up to date information and that way we can communicate to them and kind of tell them what to do in case theres any danger approaching
5208525 i call them a few times a day and once i heard that my family my cousins who live in senaki that russian soldiers were there i was besides myself
5208526 so i called them and they were very scared they couldnt go out
5208527 its very stressful and every day its like calling home 2 000 times every day and trying to find out whats going on
5208528 they said several times that they are going to stop the fire but fire continues
5208529 now they are stop the fire but concerns to the withdrawal of the troops i would love to see that they keep their word but they already broke their word several times so its very difficult to believe what they say
5208530 it fell when my car hit the lamppost and people got hit
5208531 it was a great experience we really enjoyed ourselves but the whole time we just kept saying how we wish our kids could experience that
5208532 i was actually in awe that i would even have the opportunity to go to europe
5208533 its not exactly something that you get offered every day being someone from the bronx being that it costs so much youre not always able to experience something like that
5208534 theyre here until like eight oclock at night and then theyll go and try to fundraise money they put in that extra work that makes them so much more than teachers
5208535 you really want them to have the connection that was a big point of it for us
5208536 around my block theres always a bunch of not good stuff happening its not fun
5208537 and i go and i am like wow theres so much more than just this
5208538 these are bronx kids and they dont have the advantages people have and for them to be able to see that theres a bigger world is important
5208539 i could say that we all going to miss him over here because he was a great kid best friend everybody here and all that we all gonna miss him
5208540 right now i would give my life just to bring him back a big loss a big empty empty space in my heart right now because i dont have him anymore

5208546 theres tremendous demand out there for it and its a perfect replacement for coal
5208547 it appears to be more of a bureaucratic rather than technology problem
5208548 when we started everybody said it wouldnt work but we did it and paid for it on our own
5208549 the problem is that you have to deal with so many people in different departments of hydro one to get that connection
5208550 there was manure that had e coli in it that went into the water system we could have treated that
5208551 for rural ontario this is such a big deal farmers need another source of income and from a sustainability perspective turning the farm into a power plant makes sense
5208552 our intention is to resolve it by the end of the year
5208553 price is something that will be dealt with but there are no guarantees on where the price will go
5208554 if you have to deal with the ministry of agriculture ministry of environment municipalities hydro one the ontario power authority all of these groups and still milk your cows every day youre going to run out of time
5208555 well exchange their manure for an odourless more concentrated liquid that has the same nutrient value
5208556 the german renewable energy experience from farm based anaerobic digester technology is more than impressive
5208557 people were concerned about the downturn in the u s but we were saying its not just the u s
5208558 its everywhere its europe its australia its asia japan contracted and china is slowing their growth rate may still be over 8 per cent next year too but they are such a highly leveraged economy and a slowdown from 10 to 8 or 9 for them is catastrophic
5208559 all i was trying to say to people before was its not true that demand is driving commodity prices and the dollar right now
5208560 the fact of the matter was that its a typical scenario just like in the tech run when you had big gains attracting big dollars
5208561 you have the whole strengthening u s currency which takes money away from commodities and youve got demand destruction because of the slowdown in the overall economies
5208562 the price of oil bounced violently between 10 cents and 10 a barrel in the early years and more recently to unprecedented heights

5208577 i confirm that there was a communication from me to him about him resigning however in the overall scheme of moving fiji forward this issue does not matter

5208611 i went to the terrace bar on saturday a few weeks ago to find it closed due to winton the student union was empty and showed no signs of the need for the canteen to be closed catered students were not informed of the canteens early closure and because of this we went hungry as there is nowhere else we can go for food at this time
5208612 if i do not spent all the money on my catering card then i lose it i find it appalling that i cannot in any way be reimbursed with the money i lost from when the canteen has been closed
5208613 i am a vegetarian and for a few weeks running now have been very unimpressed by the terrace bars lack of food suitable for my diet as they have run out

5208630 i just wanted to qualify i tried to keep the race clean and keep everything in control and that is what i did
5208631 the time was nothing great but it was about qualification before i start to pick it up
5208632 i have raced against robles a few times and you know he is always going to be quick but i didnt notice him in the race i was just trying to take care of my own business and i am happy to qualify
5208633 it is a brilliant atmosphere and a fast track but its not a fast track if you hit a hurdle so i was just trying to keep it clean
5208634 we arrived in the olympic village on august 16 and took an mri and the problem was in his tendon
5208635 since athens his main goal was to achieve gold in beijing
5208636 todays result was not perfect for all of us and especially liu xiang he has been under great pressure and expectations from all of us
5208637 the end of the tendon on his right foot the point where the tendon is attached to the bone
5208638 it is very close to the heel on his take off foot so there is a lot of pressure on that area that caused the problem
5208639 i think everyone in the country will be very disappointed
5208640 i dont think it was a case that he was under too much pressure he is very courageous and he had an injury
5208641 i crossed the line and i assumed he was there but i looked across and he wasnt and i was amazed
5208642 i never realised in the warm up i just assumed he was ready to go
5208643 when you see the crowd the birds nest was packed you realise why he had to come out
5208644 theres a lot of people i still care about here in the bay area
5208645 i love coming back to stanford although i didnt have a chance to go back this trip the bay area is familiar to me and i always liked the bay area
5208646 when i get that many runs i think just throw strikes and be aggressive
5208647 everything was working with that many runs just continue to pound the strike zone
5208648 every time we come here we get some crazy games
5208649 we start out good with the uribe home run and we took advantage of the guy not throwing strikes he was all over the place and when he tried to find the plate we didnt miss them
5208650 i was trying to do too much trying to be very detailed on every pitch and i let it get the best of me
5208651 we have a very good team in all aspects of the game
5208652 we can play defense hit and pitch and our bullpen is very good i think were doing a good job of bringing the same effort level every day
5208653 you come in with the same game plan read up on the pitchers check out the scouting report and thats baseball
5208654 he worked ahead in the count and moved the ball through the strike zone
5208655 he didnt straighten anything out he was sinking it stayed on the corners and was pretty good at it

5208660 i didnt run one play ha see below why however i did ask rob jones about the play calling system and he did say it should be easier to get into the called plays now also due to the new player tendencies adaptive ai if a human player cuts off a play at like the 2nd step the ai teammates apparently wont just sit around and stare theyll just go and run a set depending on who has the ball where the ball is on the court at the time the play ended
5208661 i dont remember the nba 2k3 system at this point but the practice mode has been overhauled you can run plays in it now make subs have 5 on 5 i believe and just in general in functions more like a normal practice mode should i only saw it as a 5 on 0 session for a minute or two but i did see that you could tweak how its set up
5208662 yes sliders full teams individual players for example can all be shared
5208663 so i talked with the 2k folks about dribble animations because ive always said i thought it would be cool if cp3 for example was bouncing around on his two feet after coming off a pick basically it seems like while that wont be happening due to difficulties making it look natural or smooth they definitely went back and focused on bringing in more signature layups dunks dribbles the whole nine yards how much of that is in there i cant say yet but i think its a safe bet to assume that they love doing signature animations and so they like to do them whenever they can
5208664 the more you smoke the more likely you are to have a stroke certainly quitting is the best thing you could do but cutting back does offer some benefit
5208665 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5208669 first time we were down this path we felt like that was an objective of ours to have 50 to 80 hours of gameplay we ended up just making s t up so we could fill that model now i think our range for the player will be somewhere in the 15 to 25 hour experience
5208670 weve got multiplayer we think is fun that feeds back and forth
5208671 weve also got a strategy game you could replay this thing in really different ways its not a linear game by any stretch of the imagination we felt like that was a much more fun thing to do for a player i also feel like when i look at most customers most of them dont have 80 to 100 hours to dedicate to anything id rather have more people enjoy the game
5208672 there is an inequity a lack of fairness film festivals take up the slack but the cinema i grew up with and love is a cinema of films that were visceral and touched the heart im not knocking it because i earn my living doing it but i want a reasonable platform to show the work which i consider to be my best work
5208673 it did very well at film festivals but i am trying to get it seen by more than two people and a dog i think it is very hard to work at the level we work at making these independent films and not to have recognition
5208674 it is these little festivals that reignite everything what is lacking is cinema going as a community activity we are too busy flogging it making the bucks as opposed to thinking about what the thing is
5208675 it was her absolute need to win a gold medal and her commitment to the process that stood out
5208676 its the difference between wanting success and needing it rebecca needs it wendy houvenaghel coming into this final but it was hard to bet against rebecca because of her sheer need
5208677 i said to victoria pendleton this feels like my worst nightmare
5208678 i felt like id been wrongly accused of murder and was about to find out if i was freed for the rest of my life freed from the demons
5208679 ive never seen anyone who can damage themselves so much in training
5208680 it might not while one vitamin c tablet is good for you 10 give you an ulcer you always have to be mindful of that
5208681 the last week has been a rather shaky time for her she slightly over cooked it in training
5208682 they took some drastic action a week ago and took her completely out of training all shes been doing for the last week is a little rolling on the roads
5208683 luckily she trusts her coach dan hunt implicitly and if he can describe to her how resting is going to improve her performance then shell rest
5208684 i was facing my demons but i knew i had it in me
5208685 to have become an olympic champion to have medals in two sports im so proud of myself

5208690 in the game against portsmouth last season we had many difficulties too many
5208691 now we have won 4 0 the chelsea fans saw a beautiful game and three points
5208692 we have to keep this going we can every game every week i dont know but well try
5208693 i think the owner roman abramovich is happy like all the fans hes one more fan for chelsea
5208694 the players put on the field what we did with them in training
5208695 but well need more quality in the future if we want to be champions well need more than this

5208700 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that have entered georgia since august 7
5208701 would have serious consequences for relations between russia and the european union
5208702 we must also determine if the russian intervention over its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response in an isolated case or if it marks a new hardening in moscow towards its neighbours and the entire international community
5208703 the basic agreements do not determine the ceiling for the peacekeeping contingents
5208704 how long it will take i have already emphasised depends not only on us we are constantly facing problems created by the georgian side
5208705 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

5208719 people join for getting towed but stay for the extra benefits
5208720 there was a lot of pre shopping rental cars hotels where to eat
5208721 at that time a lot of people may have decided to stay in the area because of fuel prices

5208724 but we figured we werent not going to go on vacation so we went to the woodlands

5208726 there was a lot of pre shopping rental cars hotels where to eat
5208727 there could be some supply disruption issues there so the market is watching this closely
5208728 the market will probably get through this hurricane news pretty quickly

5208792 we got all the breast tissue with a good clean margin around the dcis but we did find some cancer in the lymph nodes
5208793 we did the sentinal node biopsy during the surgery as i told you we would and found cancer there
5208794 you almost didnt even have to do the biopsy you could feel it the node was hard
5208795 so then we took out about 18 more and though the lab results arent back yet so its not official it looks like there was cancer in only two of the 19
5208796 what it means is that your treatment isnt over ill refer you to a medical oncologist who will manage your care from now on there will be chemotherapy and radiation probably but the surgery definitely was a success we got all the cancer that we could see with a good margin now youll be going after any rogue cells that might have escaped through the lymphatic system and be lurking somewhere else in your body
5208797 it doesnt normally if you catch it soon enough but if you dont it changes into invasive cancer
5208798 so thats what was in my lymph nodes invasive cancer
5208799 that will be up to your oncologist youre going to have to recover from surgery first which will probably take a couple of weeks but ill get the referral in the meantime so you can meet with your new doctor and plan out the next steps
5208800 i know youre nervous about seeing people about seeing your old friends and im feeling nervous too im thinking this whole trip might be a very bad idea so i want to make a deal with you i want to promise you that if at any time you feel its too much for you you feel you cant deal with it i will leave camp and drive you home okay
5208801 and at the same time i want you to promise me that if at any time i want to leave because i cant take it that youll get in the car and come home with me can you promise that
5208802 yeah i dont want to come in just yet im not ready for all the hubbub at the lodge
5208803 im going to find a place to string up my hammock out here i think it will be better if i keep a little distance
5208804 but come in to dinner all right i dont want to have to worry about you i want to know that you are okay
5208805 i let him out outside of camp he wasnt ready to come in yet
5208806 you let him out jo thats crazy how could you do that
5208807 hes schizophrenic you cant leave him alone in the woods hell get lost
5208808 he knows the area really well weve been coming here for 10 years i didnt leave him very far hes just out by the sweat lodge
5208809 well look why dont i check in with the registrar then you can help me take my stuff to our cabin and well talk about it some more there in private okay

5208813 im hoping camp will be a good place for him right now well see
5208814 what i realized is that ive been depressed for 10 years
5208815 i never did anything but sit on the couch and watch tv or play settlers online jack took the kids camping and skiing and went on trips with them but i never wanted to leave the house i was so inactive that it felt like my bones were ossifying it even became difficult for me to move
5208816 the house is always so full of people that it didnt seem odd that i never wanted to leave it i never wanted to go to the beach but people just assumed it was because i was fat and didnt want to get into a bathing suit and since there was always a settlers game going i could sit around all day playing board games and it didnt seem a bit strange
5208817 lets go back to the lodge and see if eddy has shown up yet if he hasnt maybe i will go look for him after all just to put my mind at ease
5208818 there you are im glad i found you would you come over here
5208819 eddy im glad i found you i felt worried because i didnt know where you were jeans here are you going to come into the lodge area and say hi to her

5208829 and i cant go into the kitchen without shoes so i borrowed these
5208830 i think you should try harder to do them do you want me to help you
5208831 maybe that would be all right charles said he could just do it by himself too
5208832 he did that was awfully nice of him but before we let him do that lets go into the kitchen together and see whats going on
5208833 you just use that retractable hose to squirt water on the dishes and then put them in the rack for the dishwasher its easy want to try it
5208834 eddy tells me hes having trouble doing the dishwashing job and that youre willing to do the work of two people is that right
5208835 you have to go find kay and get her approval for the substitution
5208836 look at your feet eddy they look injured i hope these shoes will help
5208837 are you sure youre feeling okay here eddy or are you thinking we should maybe go home
5208838 eddy wait i never see you at mealtime what are you eating
5208839 but its not happening to me its happening to him
5208840 hey jo why dont you take kays place here so we can finish this game of settlers

5208872 there is already a pullout upon command upon orders of the leadership of the biaf milf all of those involved in that action had been pulled out of the area
5208873 but we are clearing kolambugan because there are reports some of the rebels disguised themselves as civilians
5208874 we are offering consular assistance to his family but we are not making any comment on the repatriation of his body
5208875 im moving to oakland tomorrow i found a place on craigs list do you want to drive me or should i take bart
5208876 i was committed two weeks ago but nothing happened as you know now im feeling that i have to move on
5208877 ed theres no reason for you to move on our house is perfect for you we can provide you with food and shelter while youre waiting to get into the program
5208878 that might be okay if you werent also keeping watch over me mom i dont want to have to keep asking myself every second if im doing something crazy or if my mother thinks i am doing something crazy i need to get out of this house and im going to do it tomorrow
5208879 isnt that the drug capital of the bay area isnt that the murder capital of the world do you really think thats the best place for you arent you going to run into temptation there
5208880 no not necessarily there are drugs wherever you go mom there are drugs here in sunnybrae the room i found is with a buddhist who eats all natural food and meditates all day its going to be a healthy environment a lot healthier than here where i feel constantly under surveillance i cant live here theres no question about that ive already told him im moving in tomorrow theres nothing more to talk about
5208881 no one is surveilling you here we didnt object when you went camping i didnt follow you into your bedroom just now when you came home im trying to give you your space to let you have some privacy but im also worried about you and at the same time i thought we agreed you were going to go straight into a drug rehabilitation program when we got home from santa cruz what happened to that plan
5208882 find me a program to go into and well talk about it in the meantime im leaving tomorrow
5208883 why didnt you back me up now hes leaving and were going to have no idea what hes getting into over there
5208884 i didnt say anything because in the first place its pointless and in the second place maybe we need to back off and let edward make his own decisions
5208885 hes never going to grow up if youre constantly trying to run his life
5208886 trying to run his life what the hell are you talking about youre the one who said he should go immediately into a drug program youre the one who came up with this plan in the first place all ive done is run around making phone calls chasing people down trying to make this happen so i could support your idea
5208887 and i appreciate it but two weeks is a long time to wait and things arent working out as we planned we cant get him into a residential program unless were ready to pay 20 000 to some club med rehab center which were not and frankly im not sure anymore that thats what he needs anyway he hasnt done drugs since santa cruz so hes obviously not a hard core addict maybe you can find him a 12 step group to go to in oakland or a daytime program or something or better yet maybe he can find one himself
5208888 thats what i mean if hes coherent enough to find himself a place to live hes coherent enough to make decisions about a program he really doesnt sound bad off
5208889 i want to drive around the block before we go back to yoshis just to make sure he makes it inside
5208890 is he going to be all right do you think
5208891 i hope so but im not feeling very confident im not sure whats going on in his head lately he was in the psych ward two months ago i think i told you that
5208892 well things havent really returned to normal since then then two weeks ago he said he was having a drug problem we tried to get him into this program in san mateo but there werent any openings im worried about him i wish he wasnt leaving but he just wont stay home
5208893 okay lets check on him whatever you have to do
5208894 i hope things get better soon good luck with your boy
5208895 really howd he sound how does he like his place
5208896 he sounded a little spacy but he likes his place i guess
5208897 is he online now i want to get his address and phone number
5208898 youre stressing out for no reason theres nothing you can do about it anyway so youll have to let it go hes in oakland now its too late for second thoughts jesus you just dropped him off yesterday and as far as we know nothing terrible has happened give his plan a chance to work before you start getting neurotic about it
5208899 well its kind of a long story but he says he cant live here sonia he found a place to stay on craigs list and i drove him over yesterday
5208900 no i dont sonia and i was feeling very upset about it just now right before you called like weve made a big mistake in letting him go over there but lawrence says its okay he thinks eddy needs to be able to make his own decisions in order to grow up and that im being too controlling so im feeling very conflicted and confused
5208901 i was talking to him online yesterday and he sounded kind of strange theres something wrong with him jo
5208902 i think we made a mistake we never should have let him go
5208903 jo its not controlling to take care of your child somethings definitely wrong with him he shouldnt be over in oakland right now staying with some stranger
5208904 but im not sure i can do it alone i dont think hell come with me will you go with me sonia to try to convince him
5208905 yes ill come i can even drive if you want me to
5208906 that would be great because i dont like driving at night i cant see that well
5208907 but sonia i should warn you theres a problem i think i know what building hes in because i saw him walking toward it yesterday but i dont know his apartment number or have a phone number where i can call him im not sure exactly how were going to find him there
5208908 get his address tell him sonia and i want to come to see him
5208909 im going to hang up now you get the information we need ill be over just as soon as i can
5208910 thats good tell him sonia and i want to come and take him out to dinner
5208911 ask him the address tell him i dont know his apartment number get a phone number there
5208912 well its funny he got online the minute you were on the phone talking about him its like hes asking for help without coming out and saying it
5208913 you dont think im trying to run his life then
5208914 no not this time i guess he wants you to
5208915 he was walking toward that building yesterday when i dropped him off
5208916 i think he said he was on the first floor
5208917 tell him were here in the building but we cant find him ask him his apartment number
5208918 tell him to go outside and look at the door
5208919 he says hes on the first floor wait a minute ive got lawrence on the line ill ask him to tell eddy to stand in the hallway so you can see him
5208920 okay let me go get my cell phone out of the car
5208921 i cant believe we cant find him you know what we need to tell him to come down and find us who knows maybe were in the wrong building
5208922 tell you what instead of waiting here in the lobby im going to stand outside on the corner tell lawrence to tell eddy to come down to the corner and get us
5208923 it wont matter as long as one of us stays with the car
5208924 yes i got ahold of him he told eddy to come get us
5208925 weve been waiting on this street corner for you to come and get us for 20 minutes
5208926 not hungry i thought you said you were we came to take you to dinner
5208927 i was hungry but then i ate something and it passed
5208928 i want to ask you a question and i want you to be totally honest can you do that
5208929 listen ed your mom and i dont think you should stay here weve come to bring you back home
5208930 i dont know im not sure about that i just got here
5208931 well it doesnt look like its a good place for you considering youve been here for one day and youre already strung out on drugs
5208932 how much stuff have you got here lets go upstairs and get it so we can take you back home
5208933 he called a half hour ago and was told he could come in and have a bed
5208934 you have to fill these forms out before you can be admitted
5208935 come on eddy this is what you wanted remember once youve been here for three days theyll let you into project 60 like you planned
5208936 that one just says you wont sue us you dont have to read it just sign there
5208937 it says in the rules that you can use the telephone
5208938 were we supposed to feel sorry for him he was the one who was bringing all this trouble upon us he was the one who was doing dangerous drugs who was acting irresponsibly now he implies that were forcing him to do something he doesnt want to that were abandoning him has he forgotten that he was the one who made the phone call
5208939 well thats understandable eddy im sure its going to be hard
5208940 that isnt what i mean this isnt good for me theres nothing here making me better
5208941 well this isnt the therapeutic part eddy remember you just have to stay there for three days so they can verify you arent doing drugs and then theyll let you into project 60 once you get there there will be an actual program it will be much better but dont they do anything where you are im surprised arent there 12 step meetings or something
5208942 no theres nothing to do the people in here are all obnoxious and the television is on 24 hours a day its driving me crazy
5208943 eddy just hang in there i know its hard but it will be worth it its only three days honey maybe you can ask for a room far away from the tv
5208944 whats a matter honey why are you crying whats wrong
5208945 does this always happen when hes coming down off of crystal meth
5208946 i know its terribly hard i can hear it in your voice and i wish i could help you honey but i dont think theres anything anyone can do you just have to bear it you just have to get through it its only two more days
5208947 all right i guess i got two calls from eddy he sounds desperate and unhappy
5208948 i know ive been talking to him too i made a phone date with him im calling him back at 3 oclock
5208949 thats something he can look forward to then that will help the time pass
5208950 omigod hes not there he hasnt been there for hours
5208951 and then down the street to the park maybe he walked to central park from there its pretty close we might find him
5208952 on the sidewalk a block from the center im using someones cell phone
5208953 in the summer of 71 i witnessed two rather unsavory gang rapes by some of the cream of lincoln high school jockdom
5208954 they used to pick up some dumb unattractive okie girls from around franklin high get them soused and have at them one after another if they protested they threatened them this was considered acceptable and some guys lost their virginity this way you would have known all of them i declined both times but i didnt call the cops because i saw the travesty as an unacceptable but unpreventable misfortune of life
5208955 i was around one night maybe with you herbert when in the early 70s off of pershing avenue some jocks had a girl locked in a room taking turns with her
5208956 i definitely want to be pregnant at some time in my life but i doubt that ill end up with a man in the long run because i am uncomfortable with the role society affords to men the role of power and even if i reject it consciously it affects me unconsciously
5208957 we each feel free to sometimes express our feminine energy and sometimes our masculine energy that is very different from the relationship i had with my husband when i felt backed into a corner because i was always expected to play the feminine role
5208958 i hope i get to be one of those some day
5208959 are you experiencing pain in any part of your body
5208960 yes whether they got all the cancer if anything unexpected happened what the sentinal node biopsy showed if they had to remove any additional lymph nodes how i was recovering
5208961 sorry for being morbid i dont really want to make you uncomfortable i know its just your job
5208962 youre hoping there will be no cancer in the sentinal node
5208963 that it hasnt gotten into your lymph system thats the news you want to get after the operation
5208964 for you to use to communicate with the nurses when requesting medication
5208965 dont ever say youre on level six or theyll think youre lying and wont give you the good stuff
5208966 your scheduled to have a radical mastectomy of the left breast and possible lymphnodeectomy is that correct
5208967 be sure to bring your referral form with you in the morning
5208968 will my husband be able to come in here with me
5208969 no hell meet you in your room you wouldnt know if he was here anyway youll be out
5208970 youll be having your surgery in one of these rooms
5208971 why are you asking me for money what happened to your own money
5208972 oh you know the usual passport wallet cell phone money student id poetry journal papers
5208973 jesus christ edward did you have the credit card dad and i loaned you in your wallet
5208974 now we have to call up the credit card company and cancel it right away somebody could be using it right now to charge up thousands of dollars
5208975 where did you lose it on bart maybe we could call the lost and found
5208976 nah it wasnt on bart i lost it before then
5208977 the same way you always lose things mother i put it down somewhere i didnt remember to pick it up
5208978 but how could you put down something as important as your backpack i hope that 1 000 check i wrote you wasnt still in the pocket
5208979 oh yeah i forgot about that i guess i lost that too
5208980 great well im not giving you any more money and right now im going to call the credit card company and cancel that card
5208981 i think ill try to get my son to come out of his room to help me with something in the kitchen
5208982 im not sure hes been avoiding me he went for a walk on the beach for hours then came home long enough to ask for money and get into a fight then he left again
5208983 thats hard to say okay i guess hes coherent but hes distant and evasive or sometimes hes in a strange guru type mood where hell only ask philosophical questions i tried to talk to him last night to ask him what happened at the co op but he wouldnt give me any answers we got into a big fight
5208984 this morning he played settlers with me and kay but he seemed very dull his eyes were vacant he didnt have anything to say
5208985 thats my boy there couldnt be anything too terribly wrong with him if hes still got enough brain power to beat you both at that game yesterday at breakfast it seemed like he was in some kind of coma
5208986 he was like that here too id be more worried but i get the impression he could wake up if he wanted to that hes doing this deliberately
5208987 youre welcome to come and hang out with us at the house but im not sure how comfortable it will be
5208988 eddy may be there hes been in and out and weve been having some problems with him
5208989 its hard to say really maybe nothing will go wrong but hes been a bit difficult he was hospitalized a month or so ago for mental problems and were not sure that theyve completely gone away yet
5208990 dont let the door hit you in the ass on the way out
5208991 if you want to go go if you want to stay stay if you want to talk to me sit down and wait on the couch until im finished with what im doing if you dont dont youve been out wandering around all day without the slightest concern for what i wanted i dont have to drop everything im doing the second you decide you want some attention the whole world doesnt revolve around you
5208992 what do you mean by home dads and my house last time you were there you said you couldnt stand our scrutiny you didnt want to live there another day
5208993 well im not going home right now im not leaving until monday maybe tuesday you can stay here and get a ride with me then or i can give you a ride to the bus stop if you want to leave now on your own
5208994 eddy i dont understand whats going on here i dont think you realize how rude youve been first you make me and kay wait here for four days then show up without any explanation of why you didnt come before next you get lost and run your dad around the entire bay area in the middle of the night but dont show any gratitude or remorse you get kicked out of the co op where your sister is planning to live but you seem happy about it you lose my credit card but dont bother to apologize or even tell me about it and you have nothing to say to me nothing at all until you suddenly decide you want something from me or unless youre trying to make me cry
5208995 well thats good eddy thats a start because you should be sorry
5208996 you should be sorry that youre causing so much worry and upset to your family to the people who care about you the most
5208997 and what about this idea you have that youre some kind of guru
5208998 do you know how presumptuous it is for someone your age 18 years old to come in here and try to tell me what i should think and feel do you have any idea how obnoxious that is who are you to try to manipulate me to instruct me to guide my feelings what the hell do you think you know ive been on this planet 50 years and you arent even a grown up
5208999 and what about the creepy way you were talking refusing to answer questions to have a normal conversation whats that all about what gives you the right to go around messing with peoples heads is that what you did at the co op give everyone the runaround get them all upset why cant you just do whats expected of you why cant you just conform
5209000 wed be sorry wed be sympathetic to your problems if it seemed like this was something that was out of your control but it seems to both your dad and me like youre making it happen on purpose like youre playing some kind of head game that nobody else understands
5209001 so what do you want to do now do you want a ride to the bus stop
5209002 no ill wait for you ill get a ride home on monday or tuesday
5209003 i know i didnt mean to but i was just so angry and it seemed to work thats the crazy part
5209004 yeah he sounded much better it looked like he was listening
5209005 it was like a cartoon i once saw where a patient is lying on a couch and the psychiatrist is slapping him across the face saying snap out of it
5209006 how can you say that when hes such a troublemaker
5209007 i hope you wont feel insulted but every kid in my classroom is just like eddy
5209008 except that they have different parents they have parents who are trying to force them to fit in to conform who wont accept their individuality and the result is they are being turned into emotionally disturbed children eddy on the other hand is relatively normal sure he can sometimes be a pain in the ass but nothing really scary is going on with him i could see a child with his personality becoming much worse i have seen children like him who are much worse in my classroom hes as good as he is because of what youve given him because of the way youve behaved
5209009 ed and i are having kind of a private conversation
5209010 would you mind giving us just a little more time
5209011 i think ed has something he wants to tell you
5209012 well wait a minute im not sure i really said that i dont think im ready to say anything yet
5209013 didnt you tell me youd feel much better after you told your mom and dad
5209014 but im not feeling it now i dont know if this is a good idea after all im not sure i know what the consequences will be
5209015 do you want me to tell them would that make it easier for you
5209016 oh jesus eddy that stuff is really really scary its bad whens the last time you did it
5209017 do you have any more maybe you should give it to us
5209018 if he has a stash and gives it to you now thats not really going to mean anything is it since he can always go out and get more i think the important thing to do now is to accept that he has a drug problem and decide what to do about it
5209019 i say we take eddy straight from here right now to that program that francine went it called
5209020 project 60 at least thats the one for men francine went into the womens recovery program
5209021 would you be willing to go into a residential treatment program today are you ready to get some help
5209022 its time to stop now i called the bus station its time to go
5209023 i think eddy and i should take our bikes on the train together that will give us time alone that will be good for all of us
5209024 after we leave you can call project 60 and try to set up his admission then you can come home whenever you want to in the car
5209025 okay ill come now ill come tonight ill just make the phone calls first and ill have to put a few things away to lock up the house
5209026 we drive by that place on friday nights and just laugh at the people inside
5209027 who in their right mind would go clubbing in sunnybrae especially when we live just a few miles from san francisco
5209028 can you believe it what kind of woman would be motivated by this card to go to rouge on thursday nights
5209029 but presumably they want women to go there dont they do they really imagine theyre going to attract them with this
5209030 throw that thing away before we go into the store
5209031 i dont want anyone to think were considering going there
5209032 im going to check out various places to live so i can get set up for the fall semester
5209033 thats cool are you going to roses co op to lothlorien
5209034 no to a different one to stebbins but thats the one shes thinking of moving to thats the one she got assigned to for next semester can you give me a ride there tomorrow ive got kind of a lot of stuff to bring
5209035 thats great eddy so i guess this means your transfer to uc berkeley is secured right
5209036 right i think so although theres an admissions officer that is giving me trouble thats another thing i have to clear up while im here
5209037 apparently there are a lot of openings in the summer time because people move out and go back home im rooming with the manager of the place
5209038 thats cool then if you like it can you get a room there for the fall semester
5209039 no i dont think so thats a more official process you have to go through the central office and everything right now im just fishing which is what they call sleeping in somebodys room and paying them directly i think stebbins is full for the fall semester but ill find something mom dont worry
5209040 are you all right with that can i help you
5209041 are you sure you wont drop it it doesnt look very secure let me help you
5209042 we just have to find a place to stash this stuff
5209043 well not exactly i mean he knows im coming just not specifically when dont worry about it mom ive got it covered
5209044 i dont know how long does it take to know someone
5209045 remember weve got the beach house in santa cruz early this year so ill see you there june 16 ok thats in just over two weeks remember kay is coming down to play settlers with us weve got it for two weeks in june and then again in august when jean and everyone else will be showing up but in june its going to be pretty quiet so you could invite a few friends if you want maybe someone you meet here
5209046 okay ill remember i think but just in case call me on my cell phone to remind me
5209047 hey eddy its june 16 and kay and i are here at santa cruz waiting for you to come so we can play settlers
5209048 oh yeah im trying to arrange a ride right now im thinking of bringing a friend with me
5209049 well thats the problem no ones available to come today but im trying to put something together for tomorrow
5209050 oh thats disappointing its really quiet and strange here but we can make it through one day i guess what time will you come tomorrow in the morning
5209051 thats hard to say mom i dont know exactly because im depending on someone else for a ride
5209052 well you can always take the train down you dont have to depend on someone else just take bart home to sunnybrae and then hop on caltrain its easy im pretty sure thats how dad is going to come down this weekend he loves caltrain it brings you to san jose and then a bus is perfectly coordinated so you dont have to wait at all before you get on it to come to downtown santa cruz
5209053 okay good it would be nice if you brought a friend but its more important that you hurry were desperate for settlers
5209054 what are we going to do here until eddy shows up
5209055 i could pop up to my place and get my sewing machine
5209056 that fur blanket over the couch is truly hideous besides being ripped and falling apart it looks more like something youd put in a mountain ski cabin than a beach house maybe we could make a new couch cover too in seashore colors
5209057 im sure we could do that theres a lovely fabric shop on seabright we could stop and take a look and theres another place up near my house if we find nothing there
5209058 what about that lamp have you ever seen a more hideous color
5209059 do you think we could paint it lets drop by the artists supply store on river and pick up some brushes and porcelain paint
5209060 okay and what about that ugly coffee table should we throw it out
5209061 i have a wonderful idea for that i have a lot of pictures from last summer in santa cruz we could print them out on my color printer and make a collage for the table top then order a piece of glass to cover it
5209062 ohhh thats a great idea that would definitely transform the coffee table and i have boxes and boxes of pictures at home that ive never managed to put into albums making a collage with them would be really fun
5209063 why dont i call dora and see if shed like to get involved shes very artistic she could do the photo collage
5209064 good idea we need some more people here im getting kind of creeped out by the silence
5209065 edwards lost somewhere and im trying to pick him up but i cant find him because he doesnt know exactly where he is
5209066 apparently he fell asleep on bart and they kicked him off somewhere in concord when they closed down the system but he doesnt know where he is and i dont either im in hayward now and my cell is running out of batteries can you look up the concord bart station and get me an address also tell me how to get there from 880 north thats where i am now but i dont know what turnoff im supposed to take
5209067 okay honey dont worry we can do that for you hold on
5209068 i cant hold on the batteries are going call me right back
5209069 okay lets go out into my car and get on the gps system that will tell us exactly where lawrence needs to go
5209070 i wonder what more has happened i wonder how eddy sounded when he called
5209071 he said he was coming to pick me up but hes not here its really dark and im so tired mom i dont know what to do
5209072 i need to call him back now to tell him how to get to you though so i cant stay on the phone
5209073 how can you tell him how to find me when i dont know where i am
5209074 youre at the bart station right at the bart station in concord
5209075 no im not they wouldnt let me stay there they chased me away and im so tired mom
5209076 now im on the corner of wait a minute let me look at the street sign now im on the corner of oakland ave and atlantic
5209077 okay good the corner of oakland ave and atlantic we can look that up
5209078 listen eddy dont walk around any more stay where you are dad wont be able to find you if you keep moving what is on the corner there do you see any buildings around you is there a place you can sit down on and rest
5209079 yeah theres some kind of church here with some steps
5209080 okay good perfect why dont you sit down on the steps in front of the church you can go ahead and fall asleep there if you need to ill tell dad where you are hes not far away hell be there soon to get you
5209081 i have no idea what kind of neighborhood hes in and i dont like the way hes talking he sounds disoriented
5209082 okay calm down i put those street names into the system here are the directions you need to give to lawrence
5209083 thats okay i think ive found it im in front of the bart station now but i dont see him
5209084 well he just called me hes not there anymore hes a few blocks south at the corner of oakland ave and atlantic
5209085 okay wait a minute i see oakland ave im turning now
5209086 hes sitting on the steps in front of a church he might be sleeping do you see him there
5209087 all right i see a church shit here comes a policeman hes flashing his lights at me i have to go
5209088 i wonder what the police were doing there i hope eddy didnt do anything wrong i hope hes not getting arrested
5209089 is everything okay with eddy what happened with the policeman
5209090 oh nothing he was just wondering if i needed help
5209091 why didnt you call me back to tell me ive been sitting here and worrying about you both all this time
5209092 you didnt think of it jesus fucking christ you get me out of bed in the middle of the night for a big emergency and after kay and i run around like madwomen to give you everything you ask for you dont even bother to call me back and tell me youre okay
5209093 i didnt think of it look my cell phone is dying i have to go
5209094 i guess ill call you at home in the morning
5209095 are you sure you dont want to sleep in the bed with me
5209096 hes only four days late so what happened last night how did he manage to fall asleep on the bart train
5209097 im not sure he called me at around five oclock yesterday and asked me to drop everything and come pick him up at the co op in berkeley he said he was getting kicked out and had to leave right then
5209098 he didnt tell me but he said he had to leave right away and he had a lot of stuff to carry so i had to come and get him in the car i told him hell no i wasnt coming that second it was 5 oclock and the commute traffic would have been terrible i told him to store his stuff and come home on bart with just what he could carry that id be willing to go pick the rest of the stuff up with him this weekend
5209099 yes i thought so and he said okay too only he never showed up the next thing i knew it was midnight and he was calling me on the phone waking me up out of a sound sleep crying practically frantic telling me hed gotten kicked off of bart and had no idea where he was
5209100 that doesnt sound good now im more worried whats wrong with him i wonder why he got kicked out of the co op thats also a drag because roses planning to move there i hope he didnt totally alienate everyone in the house how is he sounding
5209101 i dont know all right i guess he just slept in the car last night and then this morning when i was getting ready for work he told me he was going to santa cruz we didnt talk much
5209102 you didnt ask him why he got kicked out of the co op
5209103 i asked but he gave me some kind of bullshit answer like it was their fault not his i dont remember exactly
5209104 okay honey ill let you go do you have any idea when he was going to get on the train to santa cruz when he might be showing up here
5209105 not really he told me he was going but when i left for work he was sitting at the kitchen table having a bowl of cereal then he asked for the train fare
5209106 thats typical well i guess ill let you get back to work maybe ill call you later if i need to after he shows up and i talk to him
5209107 or maybe ill just wait until i see you tomorrow you are still coming down tomorrow right
5209108 yeah i guess so but im not really looking forward to it
5209109 well you have to come anyway dont forget we have a dinner date with jill and chris theyre driving down all the way from san mateo just to eat out with us at omeis
5209110 yeah i know i remember ill be there in the afternoon i guess im thinking of bringing my new bike on the train that makes a pleasant trip
5209111 you sure you dont want to come in the morning
5209112 okay honey i wont press you ill be glad to see you whenever you get here
5209113 were glad weve been waiting a long time boy what a night you must have had last night are you tired
5209114 no not really but i dont want to talk right now
5209115 well thats really a bummer edward because i have a lot of things i want to talk to you about ive been waiting here for you to show up for four days now to start with so im a little curious about what happened with that why didnt you ever come or answer any of my thousand phone calls
5209116 then last night we all had to get up in the middle of the night to deal with your bart crisis so im thinking you owe me a little something there too a little bit of explanation
5209117 dad said you got kicked out of the co op yesterday
5209118 listen eddy im asking you a simple question just give me a straight answer what did you do at the co op that made them kick you out
5209119 the guy i was rooming with just didnt like the way i was talking
5209120 gee i think i can understand his point of view was it anything like the way youre talking to me now
5209121 i dont know how am i talking to you now
5209122 by walking away from me when im talking to you by not answering my questions by deflecting every question i ask you with a meaningless question of your own
5209123 did he really kick you out just because of the way you were talking
5209124 i dont know i guess i just made him feel uncomfortable or something
5209125 i think he thought i was trying to convert him or something
5209126 im just asking you what happened why cant you give me a straight answer you arent the only one that matters in all this you know rose is supposed to move into stebbins for the fall semester do you think you did anything that would prejudice them against her
5209127 maybe some of the people there will be a little wary of meeting my sister
5209128 does that make you happy so its not enough that you have to fuck up your own life with your little mental experiments your drug trips your adventures into insanity its not enough that you have to run your father and me all over town in the middle of the night making us crazy with worry about whats going on now you have to go and fuck things up for your sister too
5209129 youre saying something real now i couldnt talk to you before because it was just bullshit
5209130 who the hell are you to tell me if what im saying is real
5209131 why does my getting upset make you happy is that your greatest goal in life is that your deepest desire to upset me
5209132 i dont want to cry jesus manipulating me you come here and havent got a thing to say to me until i start crying then all of a sudden youre happy youre ready to talk well fuck you edward im not playing this game anymore im finished
5209133 let her try to get something out of him im finished
5209134 he said i have to make an appointment with a surgeon
5209135 jean and claire were in the car with me when he called but i didnt want to talk to them lawrence i just wanted to talk to you
5209136 i guess ill head on down to santa cruz now
5209137 i think thats a good idea jean i called lawrence hes coming home from work so i wont be alone here
5209138 okay good i feel better now i looked up your diagnosis on the internet its called zero stage cancer some sites even called it pre cancer i dont feel so worried about you now jo im sure youre going to be okay
5209139 i dont want you to worry about me i dont mean to be cold but i dont want to talk about it i just want to be alone with lawrence
5209140 okay were leaving well see you in santa cruz in a day or two
5209141 ill be going to give you and lawrence some time alone together call me whenever youre ready
5209142 let me know if you want me to go with you to meet with the surgeon sometimes its best to have a third party there to take notes because i can pretty much guarantee you you arent going to be able to remember a thing he said 10 minutes after you leave the office
5209143 okay thanks for the offer ill ask lawrence what he thinks
5209144 i just wanted to tell you that it was zero stage cancer so you wouldnt worry the doctor said if i had to have breast cancer this was the best type to have
5209145 im not going anywhere im going to stay right here im going to stay with you for a very long time
5209146 i guess i can only handle one family crisis at a time
5209147 im not feeling much of anything right now but later when we go to the surgeon im going to need you to be strong for me okay later when i get scared
5209148 what do you mean youre not going to be here
5209149 but when is it when do they when do they think its going to happen
5209150 theres no telling how long it will take it could be a month maybe two
5209151 their hearts must be shriveled if they can be so mean
5209152 i cant live here under your constant observation i cant stand you asking me every day how im feeling i dont like you tiptoeing around me all the time its driving me crazy theres no way im going to get better in this environment
5209153 i dont know but your mother and i will need to talk about it privately
5209154 why do you have to talk about it privately what is it youre going to say about me that you dont want me to hear
5209155 we dont know eddy we just want to discuss the idea between the two of us without the pressure of you standing here trying to convince us to see it your way
5209156 why shouldnt i be here who does this concern more than me
5209157 your mother and i can always talk about it later
5209158 what do you mean by not very together what is your evidence that somethings wrong
5209159 you can see somethings wrong hes so angry with us
5209160 but how is that any different than he was before
5209161 he was angry before too but it seems different now more unrelated to events hes also acting sneaky i have no idea whats going on in his head
5209162 thats true he is pretty secretive and god knows hes not all the way down to earth yet but on the other hand hes going to school every day he seems to be getting through the semester and he has a point about the atmosphere around here it is really uncomfortable its hard to sit in the same room with the two of you its not healthy
5209163 why cant he just be nice it was different when i had my nervous breakdown in college because i put myself totally in my fathers hands i trusted him to take care of me but eddy resists whatever we suggest he doesnt want anything to do with us
5209164 i guess thats the difference between a girl and a boy
5209165 he seems pretty coherent hes just acting upset like a regular teenager hes not out of his mind right
5209166 theyre meeting for the first time tomorrow we could make that a requirement if he moves out he has to keep seeing a therapist once a week and who knows maybe once hes back at the eco commune without a car and he realizes he has to get himself to the supermarket and up to csm on his bicycle hell decide its too much trouble and want to come back home
5209167 maybe on the other hand if i continue to give him a ride to school every morning ill be able to keep an eye on him
5209168 i could give him a ride to his therapy appointments too that way well know hes going i told him earlier that i just want to make it easy for him i want to take all the pressure off so he can make it through the semester and not blow his admission to uc berkeley i think we should still follow that plan even if he moves back to the apartment at the eco commune that goal hasnt changed
5209169 but what if he just goes back to his apartment and starts doing drugs and loses his mind again
5209170 well at least when hes here well know if something is going wrong well be watching him
5209171 but thats just what hes complaining about being watched and frankly im afraid if we dont let him move out hell just leave anyway theres nothing keeping him here hes legally an adult and if he just walks out on his own then we wont have any idea where he is or how to get ahold of him
5209172 he steps toward me when we argue im afraid that hes going to hit me
5209173 because im afraid if we do well never see him again hell make friends with those people hell make a life for himself up there and hell never come back home
5209174 eddy your mother and i have been talking about what to do with you weve been considering sending you away to boarding school because of all the trouble youve been getting into lately and frankly it would be a helluva lot easier to pay someone else to raise you than to raise you ourselves
5209175 but weve decided not to do that because we want to have a lifelong relationship with you
5209176 so instead of sending you to boarding school weve decided just to ground you for a month
5209177 im not playing with you eddy i need that computer to do my work to support this family
5209178 you give it back to me right now or there are going to be serious consequences
5209179 we might as well let him go i guess theres just as much chance of him recovering his senses there as here or maybe more
5209180 do you know if hes taking the medication dr hu gave him
5209181 people are free to go whenever they want here its not a locked facility
5209182 so you never know when someone will decide to just get up and quit which opens up a bed for a newcomer
5209183 you hug her and swing her around when she enters into the middle of the circle away from the door
5209184 of course hes been on drugs thats why he lost so much weight
5209185 a crying jag is listed on this internet site as one of the symptoms of coming down from crystal meth
5209186 i think we can afford that we can agree to that
5209187 let me talk to my supervisor ill call you back
5209188 two counseling sessions a week just isnt going to work for a drug addict now is it
5209189 if he doesnt kick this habit he wont be able to go to college
5209190 right now were acting like palm avenue watching you how will we be able to prove youve been clean and sober for three days if we havent been constantly watching you
5209191 i was just worried about you i wanted to know where you were going
5209192 im going for a walk i cant stay cooped up in the house all the time
5209193 but how do we know for sure what will we tell project 60
5209194 i dont give a damn what we tell project 60 they arent letting me in anyway
5209195 i dont know what im doing i dont know what im supposed to do project 60 says we have to prove hes been clean and sober for three days before theyll let him in i guess im just trying to watch him watch him so i can say he didnt do any drugs and they can let him in
5209196 well you know what even if he was here in the house you couldnt watch him 24 hours a day anyway you cant watch him when youre sleeping you cant watch him when hes sitting in the back room with the door closed its just crazy and neurotic to go chasing him down in the street
5209197 i just panicked when i realized he had gone out i just instinctively wanted to go after him to bring him back
5209198 what about project 60 dont you think getting into a rehab program takes priority over going on a vacation
5209199 i thought so a week ago when dad brought up the idea in santa cruz i thought so five days ago when i went to the interview i thought so yesterday when i called project 60 and palm avenue three times trying to talk one of them into letting me in but now im not even sure thats what i need any longer i think what i need is to be out in the forest to be homeless to meditate to be alone i was telling that to charles online last night and he invited me on this three day camping trip
5209200 i dont want you to go eddy i think we should talk this over with dad
5209201 well you two can talk it over all you want while i go pack
5209202 what is with that fucking program why cant they just let him in right now
5209203 what do you think of this idea of going camping
5209204 well im pretty sure charles isnt a crystal meth addict
5209205 thats true i guess but we were pretty sure eddy wasnt either and we were wrong
5209206 it may be eddys right this may be what he needs charles is a reasonable sober boy hes not a drug addict this might have a good effect on eddy in any case the program isnt letting him in and the way hes acting if he doesnt go camping he might just disappear anyway then wed have no idea where he was besides theres no way well be able to stop him from going so we might as well wish him a good camping trip
5209207 yes i brought my troops with me i hope you dont mind
5209208 no problem the more the merrier im just not sure ill have enough seats for everyone in my office but thats not a problem either well just steal one or two from the office next door so who do you have here with you
5209209 and this is my sister claire and my daughter rose
5209210 what im going to do is take jo back first for a quick examination and consultation then ill come out and get the rest of you for the last part of the appointment when some decisions will have to be made
5209211 nows the time to tell me if you have been experiencing any unusual symptoms lately have you had any pain in any part of your body any swelling
5209212 i had the discharge from my nipple the lactation which is what motivated me to get the mammogram that was unusual but other than that hmmm ive just got some regular complaints my vision is worsening for instance i have to wear glasses to read
5209213 well i have this strange thing that happens to my feet sometimes they hurt when i wake up in the morning not after ive been standing on them all day but after ive been laying down all night
5209214 you need to go to a foot doctor and have them make some orthotics for you foot supports that you just slip into your shoe the basic problem is that you havent got enough arch support anything else
5209215 not often but i had panic disorder about 5 or 6 years ago pretty big time and i still have some tranquilizers that i take once in awhile
5209216 not very often maybe one or two times a month if even that except its been more lately
5209217 well weve been having some trouble at home with my son hes in mercy hospital right now for the second time in three months as a matter of fact in the psychiatric ward
5209218 they dont say it might be bipolar it might be schizophrenia
5209219 im sorry to hear you are going through so much but it looks like youre in pretty good shape physically not considering the breast cancer lets go into my office and ill show you what ive seen on the films then well call your family in
5209220 as you can see theres a bit of calcification here and there but nothing to speak of overall your right breast is in good shape theres nothing wrong with it
5209221 as you can see it looks like someone just sprinkled salt all over the breast tissue you can see by the film that it is quite extensive theres no way we could go in and only remove the calcification it covers two thirds of your breast there wouldnt be anything left so in your case im recommending a mastectomy
5209222 is there anything you want to ask me before we bring in your family
5209223 i can move over so you can sit next to jo
5209224 well as i was telling jo the type of breast cancer she has does not allow for a lumpectomy since there is no lump the cancer instead has spread throughout her milk ducts like a blanket as you can see on this film its pretty extensive theres no way we could remove the cancer and save the breast for that reason im recommending a total mastectomy
5209225 not exactly thats calcification which is a by product of the type of cancer we found in the biopsy ductile carcinoma in situ or dcis
5209226 well it wouldnt be if the biopsy had come back benign calcification in and of itself is not a danger but since we know the cancer is there and calcification is its byproduct we have to assume that wherever we see the calcifications the cancer is there also
5209227 so once you remove the breast is that the end of the treatment
5209228 that depends the type of cancer your mother has is not supposed to spread and if it hasnt well remove the breast and that will be the end of it but sometimes dcis transforms into another type of cancer that is invasive the way we test for that is by examining the lymph nodes which provide a type of drainage system for the breast we used to just take out a big handful of lymph nodes and send them off to the pathology lab for testing but that can cause problems later on like edema so now we use a relatively new procedure called the sentinal node biopsy
5209229 the way that works is in the operating room we inject a dye into the tissue and follow it to identify whats called the sentinal node which is the first node that the breast drains to then we take that node and perform a pathology test right in the operating room to determine if there are any signs of cancer if there arent we stop there but if there are we take out additional lymph nodes which are sent to the lab
5209230 then after you recover from surgery you would go on to chemotherapy and radiation if your nodes came back positive you would be referred to a medical oncologist who would manage your care from that point forward deciding what type of chemotherapy you should have how much and how often etc the thinking is if the cancer has gotten into the lymph nodes then it has probably gone somewhere else too chemotherapy isnt focused on a specific mass or lump its a systemic treatment that is going throughout your body in search of that one cell here or there that may be lying in wait to come back and bite you later on
5209231 okay so were going to hope it hasnt gotten into the lymph nodes
5209232 that depends on a couple of things assuming you agree with my recommendation and approve a mastectomy the next thing you have to consider is whether or not you want breast reconstruction
5209233 some patients opt to have reconstruction during the same surgery in which they have the mastectomy im not a plastic surgeon and if you decide on that option ill refer you to one to talk about it in depth but what happens in that case is i go in and do the mastectomy first then a second team of surgeons comes in to do the reconstruction that lengthens the time of the surgery from about two or three hours to five or six also the recovery time is lengthened
5209234 two weeks youve got to be kidding me you think im going to be ready to go back to work two weeks after having my breast cut off i want six weeks
5209235 i was looking at the reconstruction options online last night they looked pretty scary to me
5209236 well as i said im not a plastic surgeon but i know they can do some pretty amazing things
5209237 the website i read said they pull the flesh up from your belly while leaving all of its blood supply still attached and mound it into a breast shape on your chest wall that destroys your belly button which they have to recreate your stomach feels like youve been hit by a truck afterwards and you dont even have a nipple they have to come back later with a second surgery to put the nipple on
5209238 thats true i think these days theyre tattooing the nipples on some women really like that they get a tummy tuck at the same time that they get a reconstruction which flattens their belly but as youve pointed out its major surgery more major in many ways than the mastectomy another way they do reconstruction is with implants
5209239 basically the surgeon puts a metal container under your skin which is filled with saline solution then you go in periodically to have more solution pumped in which slowly expands the container and stretches your skin when it reaches the size you want they do a second surgery to take out the metal container and put in the actual implant then they go back again i believe to put the nipple on
5209240 you can take that home with you and look it over you dont have to make your decision today
5209241 when do we have to make it isnt there some urgency about how soon we have surgery
5209242 no not really we dont have to do it tomorrow but we wouldnt want to wait any longer than say a few weeks
5209243 do you have any pictures of women who decided not to get a reconstruction who just have one breast
5209244 yes i think theres one in the back of the book there that woman was planning to get a reconstruction later in a second surgery so the surgeon left a lot of skin
5209245 i saw a picture a long time ago of a woman who didnt have a reconstruction after having a mastectomy she had only one breast and a tattoo over her mastectomy scar she had her head thrown back and her arms lifted at her sides like this very joyfully
5209246 i remember thinking it was a really beautiful picture have you ever seen that one
5209247 i have seen pictures of tattoos over mastectomy scars but i dont remember seeing anything specifically like that
5209248 well do i have to decide now if i want a reconstruction cant i just have the mastectomy first and then decide later if i want the other stuff
5209249 yes you could decline now and then decide five years down the line that youve changed your mind you want a reconstruction federal law says your insurance company has to pay for it if you ever decide you want it
5209250 well you dont have to decide right now in the office but the sooner the better of course scheduling surgery can be a problem and if you decide to go for the reconstruction at the same time that means well have two surgeons schedules to coordinate along with the availability of the operating room which can make it somewhat tricky and sometimes push the date out pretty far
5209251 you mentioned you cant start chemotherapy until youve recovered from surgery doesnt that mean that if you had a reconstruction and then found cancer in your lymph nodes that you wouldnt be able to begin treatment for several weeks
5209252 recovery from reconstruction typically takes five to six weeks and if chemotherapy was indicated it would have to be delayed
5209253 well if i dont have to make a final decision now if i can always change my mind and decide to get a reconstruction later i think ill just skip it for the moment
5209254 dr andreas said we dont need to decide anything now lets not rush into anything lets go home and think it over we can always call her back tomorrow
5209255 well i know how hard it is to schedule surgery
5209256 so why dont we get a few dates from you to consider before we go
5209257 lets see just considering my own schedule it looks like the earliest we could do it would be august in two and a half weeks ive also got openings august 28 august 30 september 1 and september 7
5209258 i guess well talk about it together at home and call you tomorrow
5209259 id definitely get the reconstruction because im still young and my breasts are part of my sexuality but i dont think you should have it done mom it sounds dangerous
5209260 well i know but i mean youre already married youre not dating
5209261 if you do forgo the reconstruction i think you should sign up for the sept 1 date
5209262 thats labor day weekend so we will all be off work and can come to the hospital to support you
5209263 why didnt you want to sign up for surgery in the doctors office are you thinking i should get a reconstruction
5209264 no not at all im not thinking anything im just thinking you shouldnt rush into a decision you should make an appointment with the plastic surgeon so you can talk about it with someone who knows you should be making your decision after you get all the information not before
5209265 but i dont want to talk to the plastic surgeons
5209266 i already know what theyre going to say theyre going to say its all good all fantastic but youve seen the pictures do you like the way the breasts look in this book
5209267 i think this is something we should talk about in private
5209268 i guess youre right we should be talking about this alone
5209269 well this is as good a time as any for me to be getting home
5209270 im not thinking anything specific its like i said before i think you should talk to the plastic surgeon first
5209271 are you thinking you want me to have a reconstruction do you like the way the pictures look in this book
5209272 are you worried you wont find me sexually attractive if i have only one breast is that it
5209273 if the truth be told neither of us is as good looking as we used to be
5209274 so what is this insistence on talking to the plastic surgeon
5209275 im not insisting im just saying it makes sense to get all the information
5209276 but i have all the information i need i dont want a reconstruction im sure of it im afraid of having surgery as it is the mastectomy is going to take two or three plenty theres no way i want to be put under for five or six hours for one thing i dont trust them not to make a mistake
5209277 and even if i wasnt worried about surgery i dont think the results are worth it they just dont seem to know how to make breasts very well yet ive hugged women whose tits feel like cement i dont want a hard lifeless bump on my chest
5209278 so do you mind if i call dr andreas and schedule the surgery theres no point in going to talk to a plastic surgeon thats just going to delay things
5209279 i guess if youre sure you dont want that information
5209280 im sure my mind is already made up and the good thing is i can always change it later if i decide after the surgery that i really miss having a breast i can always go back and have one constructed thats what she told us
5209281 no if it was me id want her to do it tomorrow just call and ask for the soonest date she has open
5209282 waiting three days without any program or direction obviously didnt work for you at the detox center also if its in santa cruz it wont be easy for you to walk away you wont have anywhere else to go so youll have more reason to stay put
5209283 we can always bring you whatever you need if you realize later that youve forgotten something
5209284 eddy heres a few people who are in the program here
5209285 im jo i talked to you on the phone about bringing in my son eddy
5209286 hes really nice i talked to him on the phone and the people out front said they like the program
5209287 first were going to have to fill out a few forms together
5209288 ill just interview you and fill in the answers that might be easiest then after we do that im going to want to talk to your son alone for awhile then well all meet together once more before you leave here
5209289 well eddy spent three days in a mental hospital a couple of months ago
5209290 at the time we thought he was having a nervous breakdown and might recover with rest but a couple of weeks ago he told us hes been using crystal meth so thats when we started trying to get him into a rehabilitation program we had something lined up in san mateo closer to home but it fell through then we found your place on the internet
5209291 i dont know for sure he smokes pot i guess i dont know how often he also was trying hallucinogens ecstasy mushrooms a few weeks before he went into the hospital
5209292 maybe now is a good time for me to have the private interview with edward
5209293 why dont you let me talk to him briefly in confidence
5209294 we arent leaving yet were just going to wait outside while fred talks to you in private
5209295 just talk to fred for a few minutes well be right outside
5209296 i dont know dont worry about it that guy looks like he knows what hes doing he has it under control
5209297 not exactly not yet it seems like hes having some second thoughts freds talking to him
5209298 we all had some second thoughts its hard to make the decision to enter the program but once you do it turns out to be the right thing look at me ive been here for 28 days im going to graduate next week
5209299 really did it work for you in just 28 days
5209300 absolutely i mean i could probably stay a little longer but i dont have the funds but what i got so far though its going to help me on the outside and with a little luck i wont have to check in here again
5209301 yeah for some of us it takes a little longer than others
5209302 but we all get it eventually we all get it some day when were ready
5209303 dont worry about your son maam fred will take care of him hes in good hands
5209304 ive just got a few more forms for you to fill out and youll need to give me a deposit and then you can leave your son here
5209305 i want to go home this isnt the right place for me
5209306 i thought we all agreed that this would be the best option for you
5209307 when i told you i was doing crystal meth i was lying
5209308 i thought that was the right thing to do i thought that was what you wanted to hear but this isnt the right place for me mom im not a drug addict im crazy this place wont help me
5209309 but how can that be eddy youve got all the right symptoms youre skinny and hot and your eyes are dilated you were on a crying jag
5209310 i made it up mom i thought it would be easier for you to hear dont leave me here please dont leave me
5209311 i dont understand why hes saying that whats going on is that what he told you in the interview
5209312 a lot of them want to deny they have a problem believe me ive seen it before its natural i think the best thing for you to do is leave as soon as possible that will make it easier on all of us including him the sooner he gets used to the idea that hes staying that you arent going to rescue him and take him out of here the sooner hell start working with the program
5209313 i think we should do it this guy is the expert but lets hurry i dont think i can take much more of this
5209314 its okay eddy youre going to be okay this is the best thing for you
5209315 im calling to let you know that your son has left the program
5209316 yes he left around noon we tried everything we could to bring him back but we were unsuccessful
5209317 oh my god you dont know how could this have happened is fred there can i talk to fred
5209318 fred isnt here his shift changed just before noon this morning when i came on i took some of the clients to the store as we often do and edward came with us we walked to the store about three blocks from here and everyone bought the items they wanted but when it was time to leave edward wouldnt leave with us i tried to talk to him but he just stared at me he wouldnt say anything not anything at all his eyes were completely dead what kind of drug did you say he was on
5209319 i dont see what difference that makes why did you take him out of the building when you knew he didnt want to be in the program
5209320 he had to go with us i was the only one on duty when we go to the store everyone goes together
5209321 well thats unfortunate because it really didnt work in this case did it
5209322 but when we dropped him off this morning he said that was a lie he said he wasnt on anything
5209323 well he didnt seem like he was on crystal meth to me it seemed more like some kind of hallucinogen
5209324 some of our clients tried to talk to him but they werent any more successful than i was finally we had to leave we couldnt wait there indefinitely when i got back to the facility i sent two of our big guys down to the store to look for him they followed him to the beach where he sat down in the sand but when they tried to talk him into coming back to the place he wouldnt come they stayed with him for about two hours but couldnt get anything out of him he just sat there staring at the ocean so finally they had to give up
5209325 thats the way we felt too we just didnt know what to do with him hes unlike any client ive ever worked with here he wouldnt respond to anything we said and we couldnt force him physically thats not in our policy he left his bag here he didnt take a jacket he didnt even have on any shoes
5209326 about 12 30 or 1 ive been trying to call you since then but no one answered
5209327 all right well let me give you my cell phone number so if he happens to come back you can call me ok
5209328 yes i guess we better well go look for him
5209329 not really its hard to say maybe that person there
5209330 why dont you go that way and ill go this then well meet back here in the center
5209331 no hes not out here where should we go next
5209332 thats a beach near here that he likes to go to in the summer maybe he went there hoping to meet up with someone i know some of his friends at uc santa cruz like to go there
5209333 youre right this is crazy hes probably not here anyway
5209334 i dont know maybe we should go by the police station to ask them to keep an eye out for him tell them who to call if they find him
5209335 i guess were supposed to talk to them on the phone
5209336 hi im just outside here at your station and i have something i need to talk to you about
5209337 well weve lost our son our 18 year old son were worried about him because hes been acting strange lately and we think something is wrong with him but we arent sure what weve been out looking for him all over town but now its dark and were thinking we should go home so we wanted to give you his description and our phone number so you could call us if he shows up
5209338 she thinks theyve already picked him up she thinks the sheriff has him
5209339 oh thats wonderful im so relieved i cant tell you how glad that makes us can we pick him up now can we take him home with us
5209340 well since the sheriffs department has him they cant really come over the border into the city they say you can meet them in the parking lot of a restaurant on the south side of town theyll hand him over to you there
5209341 it might be a drug problem we dropped him off at cronus of santa cruz this morning but he left this afternoon weve been looking everywhere for him im so glad you found him we were about to give up
5209342 its a good thing you called because we were about to let him go he hasnt really done anything illegal
5209343 why do you have him what caused you to pick him up
5209344 someone called us who was concerned about him apparently he was just knocking on doors asking if he could come inside and talk to someone
5209345 he was perfectly friendly just acting a little strange and he doesnt have any shoes or any belongings with him it doesnt seem to me like hes on drugs
5209346 theres also a possibility that he has a mental illness
5209347 im not sure what were going to do with him just bring him home i guess
5209348 your dad and i have been looking all over town for you weve been so worried about you why did you leave the program the woman at the place said you wouldnt talk to her or to anyone about it that you just walked away but we all agreed that the program was the best thing for you i dont know what were going to do with you now
5209349 at least he seems sorry about what happened maybe hell stop now
5209350 the crying he must have been crying for a good 20 minutes

5209381 in an effort to offer as many advanced placement classes as we can in high school one teacher at one high school can teach it to other students in real time with interaction through a computer
5209382 students can take their advanced classes via the computer and participate in video conferences
5209383 for instance if there is a shortage in spanish if we need that we can do that in addition to advanced placement classes online
5209384 our staff each year does a tremendous job they use a lot of their initiative and are a very dedicated and talented staff we have a tradition of producing excellent scores on tests and we want to exceed in 21st century skills so our students are successful in a global world
5209385 the sixth graders will be going to moundsville middle school which is no longer a junior high and the sixth graders from sherrard will go to sherrard middle school which is new
5209386 four new rooms have been added to the moundsville middle school in order to hold the influx of students both of those facilities were in our bond package
5209387 we relocated the horticultural program and remodeled classroom space for technology
5209388 we intend to offer more dual credit opportunities for our students from west virginia northern community college and will also be open for adult learning opportunities for example someone at the coal mine who wants to work their way up in ranks to management will have the opportunity to take classes at john marshall high school as if they were at west virginia northern community college
5209389 we have a principals academy to provide them additional training and time to meet together to review procedures and polices
5209390 our excess levy expires at the end of this school year so the board will be setting the levy date in august
5209391 that will be critical to our county system the voters of brooke county have always supported the schools it will be very critical for us to pass our excess levy its our local operating money we do get state money but our county depends on operating money to provide free text books and to try to keep up to date with technologies supplies and instructional materials for students
5209392 we have done over the course of the summer a lot of building maintenance across the county as we usually do with upgrading and improving
5209393 we take pride in preparing not just in july and august its an ongoing process to keep the direction of the curriculum up to date we are excited and anticipating another great year for ohio county
5209394 we are hoping within the week the lights and security bollards will be set it will add something very significant to the front of the building both appearance wise and security wise all of our buses are also ready to go clean and inspected the custodians worked hard over the summer and the buildings look fantastic the students are pretty much ready to come back and we are definitely ready to have them back
5209395 more and more information is but a keystroke away for the modern student
5209396 knowing how to access that information is a key to a competitive education for that reason tyler county schools continues to focus on technology education in all areas of the curriculum and at all levels elementary middle and high school
5209397 historically speaking punters are good at picking election outcomes and its clear that they disagree with us that the liberals have no hope of winning
5209398 people just watch sports on television at home with their friends and during the olympics if there is a television in a restaurant they might watch but there are no what you would call chinese sports pubs
5209399 dont know what they are talking about they offer their opinions with no justification of facts at all
5209400 maybe because of the olympic games people are watching more sports
5209401 and if people enjoy doing it so much they will want to do more of sitting together and drinking beer and watching games
5209402 i think this could make it because many people in china today want to go somewhere that is stylish to be seen
5209403 maybe they can go on and do well in the tournament i might be back for the next game

5209414 i guess those other people were saner than i am
5209415 no he didnt make friends at his elementary school but he made friends at church he made them at camp
5209416 no he has had long standing friendships with people from camp he made friends in high school that he still sees
5209417 so your son has been in a lot of trouble with the authorities
5209418 just pay attention to how you react if you think youre getting worse stop the experiment
5209419 eddy dont you think you should do what the doctors tell you
5209420 hes doing pretty well i guess he spends eight hours a day at an out patient program near the hospital im not sure what he does there he doesnt want to tell me much i know theres some kind of group therapy a few different groups i think and some individual therapy too maybe crafts
5209421 he spends a lot of time in his room he mostly wants to be alone im not doing too well though
5209422 well theyre going to cut my tit off next week
5209423 why dont you holler goodbye to him through the bathroom door anyway
5209424 he wants to go to half moon bay with us
5209425 thats great im glad he wants to get out of his room
5209426 yes i think so he goes out every day after all to the program he walks there by himself i think it will be good for him to go out and have some fun with friends thats nice of you to take him
5209427 well eddys disappeared we were sitting on the beach and he just got up and walked off and never came back weve been waiting for him for a long time but now its getting late and weve got to go home i wasnt sure what to do should i just leave him here
5209428 i dont know what else you can do if hes disappeared what beach are you on are you in half moon bay
5209429 no we decided to go a little further south im not sure of the name of the beach its near san gregorio
5209430 did he say anything when he left was he angry
5209431 no he just stood up and walked off without an explanation so what should we do now
5209432 well can you wait a little longer maybe half an hour would that be okay or is that pointless
5209433 okay okay then why dont you stop by the police station and just give them his description and my phone number in case they come across him and hes disoriented
5209434 just go to the next town or if you cant find one there just go to the one in half moon bay just as a precaution thats what we did in santa cruz and they found him right away
5209435 no no im just not sure what good it will do
5209436 im not either but at least then weve done something so if hes lost we might be able to find him
5209437 im sure hes fine for all i know he could be hitchhiking to santa cruz by now we just wanted you to have our name and number so youd know who to call if you happened to pick him up
5209438 its dangerous out there on the rocks the surf could come up and take him away its life threatening for him to be on this desolated bit of coastline alone at night
5209439 the helicopter spotted him this morning not far from where he disappeared but he wont get into the squad car he refuses to cooperate
5209440 yes physically hes okay hes sitting here on the beach in san gregorio but since he doesnt want to get in the squad car theres really not much else we can do for him we dont want to arrest him because he hasnt broken any laws we could wait with him here until you arrive to pick him up but he says he doesnt want that either so what do you want us to do maam
5209441 id drive out there to pick him up but i dont think hed get into the car with me when i got there
5209442 so i guess you should just leave him where you found him
5209443 id like to drive to santa cruz and go to the sock shop im thinking of buying lots of pairs of cool socks one for each chemo treatment they have scheduled then ill wrap them up and after each treatment ill pick one out for a reward just like when you were a kid and went to the doctors office i could also buy a pair of cool tights for you and we could spend some time hanging out at the beach
5209444 and youll have to do whatever i decide this is supposed to be my day my treat from rose so its no fair trying to talk me out of or into something you just have to go along with what i choose
5209445 the chemicals theyre putting into me stink and theyre scary one is bright red like kool aid i get two huge cylinders that must hold a quart full of that the nurse couldnt get the needle into my vein the first time she jabbed and jabbed at the back of my hand your father cried
5209446 my doctor calls me the energizer bunny because i just keep ticking
5209447 i leave the television on to keep me company there doesnt even have to be a show on just the sound of static is comforting
5209448 im taking a class on female sexuality and i have a project due on body image
5209449 and i want you to film me walking naked down the side of highway 1
5209450 oh come on mom itll be fun there arent any policemen out here
5209451 i really dont like this idea at all something bad is bound to happen someone might pull over and attack you or theyll get into an accident theyll be so distracted by the sight of you walking naked that theyll drive off the road
5209452 mom be serious thats not going to happen there arent even very many cars out here
5209453 hold on a minute lets think about this theres got to be something else you can do for the assignment that will work what was your whole idea
5209454 well first i thought id take some videos of me walking naked along highway 1
5209455 then id do a voice over about how i feel about my body then i want to interview you about what you said to me about sex when i was becoming a teenager how my body was my own and you wouldnt try to control my virginity because that was so cool mom and that had such a big influence on me on how i feel about myself and how i turned out as a woman
5209456 rose im very glad to hear that really i am and id love to help you with this project id be honored to be interviewed on your film but i just dont want to do anything too crazy or illegal right now im feeling too vulnerable if something bad happened i dont think i could handle it
5209457 maybe eddy could film you while i hid in the car
5209458 no wait a minute i changed my mind that wouldnt work because the policeman would bring you back to your vehicle then hed find me and hold me responsible
5209459 do you really think he would mom even though were adults it wouldnt have anything to do with you
5209460 rose thats it we could do it in the corn maze that would look great on film and it would be private no one would see you
5209461 of course itll be perfect turn left at this driveway turn left turn left
5209462 can we just go in a little ways and then come back out the entrance
5209463 we just want to take some pictures we dont want to go all the way through
5209464 as far as im concerned you can do whatever you want to as long as you pay me just mind you dont get lost in there
5209465 perfect that was perfect rose but could you do it again im not sure i got it framed right
5209466 no a black friend it would make me much cooler

5209470 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5209471 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5209472 weve had a fortunate two years but for all of us who were here the memories of 2004 and 2005 are still fresh
5209473 now is the time for floridians to take the steps necessary to prepare should fays track bring her over our state this week

5209522 whats the difference you need me to go with you what will you tell them do you even have your insurance card
5209523 this behaviour is inappropriate but the spanish athletes involved have apologised formally to china for the photograph and the matter is now closed
5209524 we did it because we came to china we dont want to do anything bad for chinese people or asian people
5209525 we think maybe we took a bad picture but we never wanted to offend anybody we didnt see it as a racist gesture
5209526 im chinese and we call westerners white people not ghosts
5209527 and to be frank id rather have slitty eyes than be a hairy spanish person and i am goddamned annoyed im very offended
5209528 a lad did this to me once and i slapped him silly
5209529 i hope they lose all of their medals and are sent back to spain with nothing
5209530 as for the madrid bid i would encourage everyone to block it until spain can demonstrate they have grown up

5209537 there is no chance of resignation he will defend himself against the allegations and defend his position
5209538 unfortunately some elements acting for vested interests levelled false allegations against me and deceived people
5209539 they said that during the last nine years our economic problems and electricity shortages were due to our policies it is absolutely wrong and deception for the country
5209540 they never realised that they could be successful against me but they never thought how detrimental it would be for the country

5209553 to prevent potentially embarrassing protests inside tibet china has turned large parts of tibet into a virtual prison for the duration of the games
5209554 many should feel ashamed of their groundless accusations once they know what the chinese government has done for ethnic minorities
5209555 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not being respected at all by chinese officials in tibet
5209556 the more of the personal stories i heard the more i wanted to do to raise awareness
5209557 a very unwelcome and unacceptable kind of activity in china
5209558 hes a non tibetan supporter and hes really working for the tibetan cause
5209559 we have a responsibility to do something to show the world that tibet needs to be free
5209560 we really appreciate his support and the risk and trouble he took
5209561 he was able to show the spotlight about what is going on in tibet right now and how the tibetans are suffering

5209572 ill just feel him out see if he acts any different when you arent around
5209573 really he was fine he didnt say anything crazy we sat and talked together the whole time
5209574 no he wasnt there but eddy said hed talked to him theyre giving him some kind of medication apparently maybe thats whats doing it he also seems pretty freaked out by the hospital he wants to come home maybe just being there shook him up enough to make him come back to his senses
5209575 i guess ill go with you tomorrow if you think thats a good idea when are they going to let him out exactly did anyone tell you since he went in at 1 in the morning on thursday night does that mean theyre going to release him at 1 in the morning on sunday or will they let him out a little early or late
5209576 im not sure we might be able to ask the doctor about it tomorrow the nurse said hes not really supposed to tell us anything for confidentiality reasons since eddy is 18 but since hell be coming home with us we might be able to use that to get some information
5209577 is he coming home with us for sure did he agree to that
5209578 yes yes hes perfectly reasonable im telling you maybe its you that was making him crazy
5209579 maybe i should be the only one allowed to talk to him from now on
5209580 oh yeah i was meaning to fix that before i sold it to you thats just a fuse that needs to be replaced do you know where the fuse box is
5209581 its on the drivers side under the dashboard next to the door just take the cover off and you can see the fuses lined up in there it will be easy to tell which one is for the radio because the metal band across the middle will be broken you can get replacement fuses at any auto parts store for 50 cents i was meaning to fix that but i never got around to it
5209582 but the bigger problem is the car wont start my brother was all excited about taking it to work this morning but when he got outside the engine wouldnt turn over
5209583 no he didnt really have any time and we couldnt find the cables i thought id ask you about it first
5209584 somebody probably left the radio on and that drained the battery its wired a little funny since the radio isnt working you dont remember to turn it off but it still drains the battery just turn off the radio and jump the car then you know you need to drive it around for 20 or 30 minutes to recharge the battery right
5209585 right i think my dad has some jumper cables in his trunk does it matter what kind of jumper cables you use
5209586 the jumper cables dont matter and the batteries dont either unless you have a really old car in which case you might have a six volt battery that could be a problem but the toyota youve got is a 12 volt so you should be able to jump it with any new car
5209587 dont you even want to know what happened to eddy
5209588 we were with him there until 1 in the morning on thursday the day you left with the toyota then they decided to keep him for observation
5209589 theyre holding him on the basis of him being fucking insane
5209590 i didnt realize i figured they were just going to talk to him where is he exactly
5209591 no hes not going back there jason hes nuts he cant live alone hes going to need to stay here for awhile where we can keep an eye on him
5209592 well i guess i better get my stuff out of there then
5209593 if youll come with me we can find a private place to talk
5209594 i understand hes going to stay at home with you
5209595 thats good because we dont think he should be living on his own hell be given only two or three days worth of medications just enough to last until you find him a treating psychiatrist who can prescribe more
5209596 what does that mean what do you think is wrong with him
5209597 it is a mood stabilizer it could be that your son has bipolar disorder thats one possibility he could also be schizophrenic or any number of other things all we know for certain is that he has suffered a psychotic break but why that is we dont know im not the one to make that determination thats for his long term psychiatrist to do
5209598 where should we look for a long term psychiatrist can you recommend someone who would be good for him
5209599 risperdol is an anti psychotic thats probably what has brought about the results seroquel is to help him sleep at night
5209600 can you recommend someone how do we know who to go to
5209601 well unfortunately a lot will depend on your insurance if you can bring me a list of the psychiatrists on your plan i can point out ones that i think are good
5209602 okay but are you going to be here when we come back
5209603 ill be here at five which is when we are releasing him if you bring the list then ill take a look
5209604 hes fine hes just busy hes just doing his job
5209605 whys he so busy why cant he give us 15 minutes to answer our questions for christs sake
5209606 i brought a list of psychiatrists i want to show dr hu
5209607 and there are some forms here that you need to sign
5209608 okay well we can do that now i guess is dr hu here
5209609 this one just says youre taking eddy home with you
5209610 it was an experience all right not one that i would want to have again but then maybe again i would i managed to escape alive but thats because i lied to the doctors if you ever find yourself in the psych ward henry all you have to do is tell them what they want to hear they let me out can you believe that crap
5209611 no no no they definitely should have let me out i was through with them two days ago theres nothing going on there some of the patients are okay there was one girl that was sending out some interesting signals but omigod they want you to sit and draw a star or something in group therapy and then they give you a little paper cup full of pills like im going to take that shit
5209612 well i did take it yeah i took it at first because i thought i was supposed to but then i couldnt sleep all night the man in my room kept moaning and rolling over in his bed and i wanted to get up and take a shower because i smelled like shit but first i needed the little socks they give you with tread on the bottom so i wouldnt be walking over all those germy germs on the floor and absorbing them through my skin but i had to take a shower right away because god did i stink
5209613 it was an impossible dilemma if i got up to take a shower id get the germs coming into my body through my feet but if i stayed in bed id die of asphyxiation or something because i swear i was sweating out toxic fumes that medicine they give you is lethal and they dont ask you they dont check you they dont want to know how its working i swear i only talked to the doctor one time for maybe two minutes in a tiny little room of course i didnt tell him about the sparks flying around his head i knew he didnt want to hear about those he didnt want to hear that i could tell what he was thinking
5209614 he couldnt even see that his thoughts were projecting on the wall behind him
5209615 but the meds i took the meds they gave me
5209616 and i think you should keep taking them until you get your feet on the ground i think were all pretty upset and wiped out that was a pretty traumatic experience i made a bed up for you in the back room do you want to see it
5209617 im sorry you cant have your old room back eddy because henry moved into it as soon as you moved out but hopefully you wont mind staying in roses old bedroom
5209618 yeah well i wont be staying here too long anyway so it doesnt really matter
5209619 probably not but dad said you wanted to stay until the end of the semester anyway you only have a month or so left to go right and i know you want to pass all your classes so you wont lose your admission to uc berkeley in the fall
5209620 i know its not ideal eddy but at least it can do in a pinch cant it i can get most of my stuff out of here if you want rose liked it well enough all those years it was hers
5209621 yeah that would be nice if you could get your crap out of here i guess or maybe it doesnt matter
5209622 yes ive got them in the other room do you want to take them now
5209623 this is dr brand from the womens center im calling to tell you that your biopsy report has come back and you do have what i suspected ductile carcinoma in situ
5209624 its a form of breast cancer but the good news is if you have to have breast cancer this is the best kind to have the in situ part of the name means it hasnt traveled anywhere what we found in the biopsy was not invasive cancer nonetheless it will have to be excised the next thing you need to do is make an appointment with your primary care physician and ask her to refer you to a surgeon
5209625 youre going to want to call your primary up right away
5209626 ive got a problem i need to talk to you about
5209627 the rationale for an abortion he was probably just happy for one fleeting moment when he realized i wasnt dumping him or maybe hes thrilled to have his potency confirmed some kind of macho pride in his healthy sperm
5209628 i havent got a college degree i havent got a good place to live
5209629 but i really dont want to have an abortion either
5209630 i always told myself that i believed in a womans right to have an abortion but that i would never have one myself
5209631 its not fair i used a diaphragm every time i dont see how this could have happened
5209632 i mean weve made love like a hundred times this month right but two times i made love to other people
5209633 yes right at the beginning when we were first getting together when we werent really a couple yet
5209634 i practically forced myself on him he wasnt really interested i dont know what i was thinking why i seduced him i guess i wanted to hang around the chronicle newsroom
5209635 im pretty sure he already has a girlfriend on the paper the librarian besides hes about a hundred years old theres no way im going to tell him about this he wouldnt be the slightest bit interested
5209636 weve been flirting with each other for years and before i started going out with you we tried being boyfriend and girlfriend for about two weeks but it didnt work out he got angry and threw me out of his apartment one night when i was pretty sick with strep throat or something and i realized he wasnt someone i could depend on besides hes a hardcore alcoholic he wouldnt make a good father i dont think i want to tell him about this either
5209637 if you dont want to get married but you still want to keep the baby and you dont want to bring it up with either of these other guys id be glad to be the father
5209638 because my father died this year you know and this baby could be his reincarnation
5209639 but what if i decide i want to have an abortion
5209640 right now were just having a kind of private conversation
5209641 god forbid you should have your private conversation in the privacy of your room but hey thats okay i know when im not wanted fine then be that way
5209642 if thats what you want to do then ill support you
5209643 but i dont want you to think its your only option
5209644 what this would be his father speaking youve only just met her how do you know its yours
5209645 why does this baby get to live when the other one didnt
5209646 oil prices also fell to the lower end of the recent trading range on friday so some traders in the market probably saw that as a buying opportunity
5209647 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5209648 i hope you dont mind doing this on my bed
5209649 one way ive been interested in lately is we can spread all the cards out and you can select ones that call to you then you can tell me what draws you to the card why you chose it what it signifies to you afterwards i can give you additional interpretations from my books
5209650 i guess its the abundance it seems to indicate that he has plenty hes proud of how well his bush has grown and all the fruit it has produced he doesnt have to worry about starving i guess this could represent all the good things i have in my life right now my home my job my family
5209651 the seven of pentacles can represent wealth and good fortune in business also innocence and ingenuity
5209652 notice how uncomplicated the scenery is and the simple modesty of his dress although hes wealthy he doesnt seem sophisticated or corrupt he seems to genuinely appreciate what he has like you do
5209653 theres something about the solitude that appeals to me and the ocean setting ive always felt the ocean was a home to me sometimes i get the feeling that the ocean is my mother
5209654 it looks like hes going on a journey but a pretty safe one he has all his wealth to return to if he decides to come back what does the book say
5209655 well one interpretation is the figure is rejecting his riches leaving them behind to seek new fortune but it also can represent modesty mildness or timidity another interpretation is a change in priorities what you once thought was important becomes inconsequential
5209656 i know this is crazy and probably terrible bad judgement but for some reason this card is really interesting to me
5209657 i can see why youd be frightened to pick this card but it can be read on a number of levels
5209658 but before i read from the book why dont you tell me why you picked it what does this image mean to you
5209659 i dont know why i like it i guess it has something to do with the drama the complete seriousness of the card the figures could be falling or leaping into a new place a new phase a new type of existence it looks like a total shake up a destruction of the status quo
5209660 its true the card represents a destructive force but it can also stand for the creativity that is born as a result of that destruction
5209661 it can be a card of new beginnings or you could think of the destruction as applying to something negative in your life something you want to get rid of
5209662 im not sure exactly why i want it and im afraid it might be terrible bad luck but it really is having the strongest pull on me
5209663 i am an author and am totally against plagiarism but the use of personalities which are already in existence is common
5209664 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5209665 sono speciali dice osvaldo mi hanno detto che c la maglietta con la foto della mia rovesciata contro il torino io quel gol lavr rivisto mille volte mi emoziono ogni volta che lo rivedo
5209666 ora guardiamo avanti e pensiamo ad una partita per volta alla juve guarderemo solo dopo il preliminare spiega osvaldo non credo che sia la gara dellanno la prima di una lunga stagione ha un valore particolare per tutti e un sapore speciale anche per me ma non dimentichiamoci che c tutto un campionato davanti
5209667 i would like to congratulate george michael for whom it seems eli stone was created
5209668 for myself and nick and most of the team its definitely not that
5209669 my parents are working class and we dont have any family money and without lottery funding theres no way i could have gone full time at the age of 18
5209670 its a great accomplishment to book thousands of dollars of revenue within a few weeks of launch but as the article states this is profitability without covering salary a big disclaimer
5209671 by his maths my first business was profitable in the first week including my salary
5209672 what makes product businesses unprofitable upfront is not the ongoing costs its the development costs
5209673 in the accounting sense may expose one to accounting intricacies and ambiguities depending on the structure and complexity of the business entrepreneurs cannot simply discount important costs
5209674 the cost of an alternative that must be forgone in order to pursue a certain action

5209679 das ist das erste bild eines teilchens dieser gr e vom mars und die daten stimmen mit unseren vorhersagen berein die wir anhand der f rbung w hrend der sonnenunterg nge auf dem planeten gemacht haben
5209680 um ein solches bild machen zu k nnen ben tigten wir das leistungsf higste mikroskop das je die erde verlassen hat sowie ein besonderes tr germaterial um den marsstaub zu fixieren
5209681 wir waren uns dar ber klar dass es sehr schwer werden w rde bilder von so kleinen teilchen zu machen
5209682 wir freuen uns sehr dass das mikroskop bilder geliefert hat die es uns erm glichen den mars detaillierter zu untersuchen als das je zuvor m glich war
5209683 das zeigt auch die leistungsf higkeit des mikroskops nun k nnen wir untersuchungen durchf hren die die ergebnisse der anderen wissenschaftlichen experimente an bord von phoenix um eine neue dimension erweitern

5209687 this couldnt have happened to her so close to the finish line and just to be like that it must have been horrific for her out there
5209688 i may have to say no actually i was last
5209689 so when it happened on kilometer 39 with two miles to go i thought for sure i was done i thought there was no way i never felt pain like that running in my whole life i dont understand what happened i was drinking every station i was taking three gels i dont understand why i got such bad cramps
5209690 when i was sitting there looking at the stadium and i just couldnt move because it was just pulling so strong i didnt think i was going to finish the race
5209691 i said to myself even if it takes me a half an hour i just have to give myself a chance to finish
5209692 that was probably the most magical moment of my whole olympics
5209693 i went through that gate knowing that whatever happens i have only one lap to go and i will finish this race that i think was the first time that i really believed i was going to finish
5209694 the governments citizen diplomacy is not about encouraging people to contravene the laws of the country or those of their host nations
5209695 citizen diplomacy is all about rights and responsibilities and not about breaking constituted laws
5209696 there are certain things the citizens are not entitled to for example if you carry drugsand you are caught in saudi arabia and your head is to be cut off what do you expect government to do
5209697 in your call for government intervention you are not saying that you did not carry drugs you are not saying that your trial was not free and fair you are calling on government to appeal to the saudis not to cut off your head
5209698 the minister said that citizen diplomacy was not about protecting lawless citizens pointing out that
5209699 liyel imoke has been a natural candidate for us and our people as one of those who contributed to the making of the nigerian constitution i am disappointed at the endless election petitions and tribunals in the country

5209721 the criminals who carried out this attack are trying to take northern ireland back to its violent past
5209722 those who carried out this deplorable attack have nothing to offer our society they have no support from the community or any political party and will deliver nothing to our community
5209723 the spectre of times past had also reared its ugly head
5209724 for the first time in a long time in the last year the people of northern ireland witnessed terrorist attacks on police officers by those who have nothing to offer our society
5209725 in their delusion terrorists must not be allowed to undermine the genuine progress that has been made and i trust that all those who want to live in a future that bears no resemblance to the past will unite to deny the dissidents any foothold in the present

5209728 mashup platforms are in the pole position and ready to grab the lions share of the market and an entire ecosystem of mashup technology and data providers is emerging to complement those platforms
5209729 custom applications that combine multiple disparate data sources into something new and unique
5209730 combine manipulate and tie together disparate data sources to present a unified view
5209731 the most complex of the three process mashups allow users to mashup not just data sources but also business processes themselves customizing process design and invoking business logic across multiple applications
5209732 to organize the immense amount of information available on the web
