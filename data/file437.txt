4370000 the effects of the travel and the speed of things has worn them out
4370001 its crazy its hectic its fun its awesome its expensive
4370002 it wasnt easy to put together but gosh whats our choice
4370003 when you look at this were one of the top 16 teams in the world for this age group and thats really quite an accomplishment
4370004 we had four or five of the best seven or eight pitchers in the region
4370005 the offense is pretty powerful pretty potent but pitching and defense win these games
4370006 i think ill remember the pure joy on those kids faces after the last out
4370007 that scene the mob at the pitching mound when they tackled each other

4370011 we still have to figure out the holders and find consistency from the snappers
4370012 she looks on the internet every day i tell her to stay off of that stuff
4370013 my mom was the mom who was at every game even if it was car pooling taking five other kids to tournaments
4370014 she has been there since day one and im real grateful
4370015 we talked about our young receivers and typically the same names how are these guys going to fit i would add him to that list
4370016 i knew at some point this preseason they were going to give charlie more reps
4370017 more opportunities to show what he can do in a game ive got a feeling but thats all it is a feeling
4370018 it cracks and moves around and does all kinds of weird stuff that i dont even feel in my left knee
4370019 its just a project that keeps me on my toes all the time
4370020 every day its a constant something coming up with the knee
4370021 well see how long he can hold up but hes doing a nice job we just have to be smart he knows his body better than anyone he keeps us with a pretty good understanding of what is going on
4370022 im excited to kick this season im all about the competition
4370023 i just believe you need to cultivate your kickers because they spend the most time with each other
4370024 id rather be kicking but if thats whats best for the team is having me hold and someone else kick then im all for it
4370025 you can do a little bit of everything with it but i want to own my own business someday
4370026 it took me awhile to get used to how cool it is here but now its hard to go back
4370027 i feel like im stronger in better shape ive gotten heavier because ive put on a little bit of muscle im about 320 and i was about 315 the beginning of last season
4370028 the only way to truly be happy in life and be successful is to do what interest you
4370029 i just stayed focused on the end result when you have everyone doubting you and your abilities this is the fuel that motivates the engine to run harder and faster every successful person goes through what i call their trial period this is where you have to go through different trials and tribulations to not only show the world what your made of but to show yourself that you are made of something you are somebody and a serious force to be reckoned with a lot of people believed that all my ideas and goals wasnt going to work they thought that i was just dreaming when i told them that one day i will own my own multi million dollar company making my own moves and calling the shots i love to tell my story because this is my way of saying to everyone who once talked down about me look at me now and what i have accomplished you know in my early days before my company took off i was that person working minimum wage jobs such as fast food i washed dishes cleaned toilets and put up with a whole of crap coming from so called bosses that i really thought were monkeys thinking that they were better than me and how they treated me but i guess you can say that this is how it is when your working for someone else you might as well say that i really felt like the toilets i cleaned ha i feel like this is the main reason why more and more people are turning into entreprenuers i mean lets be honest getting up in the morning going to a job sucks big time you will never make independent income that way how does that feel knowing that someone else controls your income you know a lot of people ask me well how can i become rich the best answer i tend to give them is they first have to figure out what their good at what is their expertise also you should find a good mentor you know someone who can inspire you to keep pushing even harder for your dreams and aspirations my mom and dad were a portion of good mentors to me before my mom latonya knight passed away she always taught me to be humble she was a very strong women my mother was a go getter my mother was the type of woman who made things happen period i feel this is why i am the way i am today because of her and my dad my dad who is currently still living can vounch for how my mom was she was very thorough with everything she did but all in all i love both of them and couldnt ask for a better mother or father they are both a reflection of who i am today
4370030 you could tell they had a great motivation to win this game
4370031 thats normal i think for them it was a big disappointment to lose to us a small country overseas
4370032 defense just requires energy and brains and we had a supply of that tonight
4370033 two years weve been listening to everybody talk about how we cant defend the pick and roll we couldnt do this we couldnt do that well not true we proved we can
4370034 they knew what they needed to do to take us out of our game
4370035 it wasnt about technical stuff they just dominated us with athleticism it was incredible they are the best athletes of the world
4370036 that game in the world championships ok that was an incredible game for us
4370037 but i dont think a game like that can happen every two years maybe every 20 years the states have a great team i think they are the favorite to win the gold medal
4370038 everybody in the world has an ego and i believe after the game they lost in japan they came here to prove that they are a better team
4370039 they are more of a team in the true meaning of the word i believe there is no team that can stop them from the gold medal
4370040 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4370041 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4370042 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4370043 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4370044 and then i saw that people were actually interested in it
4370045 im not sure if people understand the feeling of being sent down its tough no matter what
4370046 you work your whole life to get there its your ultimate goal your lifes dream and once youre there its hard to go back to the minor leagues after that but then i was around some really good friends and that made it easier
4370047 to be honest with you just that alone made it an easier transition
4370048 im sure its totally frustrating and just has to be a downer to be sent back after doing so well in the bigs
4370049 but just know that there are so many of us out there who are really pulling for you
4370050 when im ready to write or something has gone on with me that i think is worth writing about i do it this time id planned to keep it short but i found that i had a lot more to say i kept going back to it
4370051 my teammates were kidding me about it when they first found out
4370052 but looking at it now and seeing how its grown it makes me want to keep doing it
4370053 the chinese government lied through its teeth about human rights isnt the ioc ashamed
4370054 there was certainly some hope and aspirations made in 2001 that the games would have a positive impact on the wider social framework and i think we have to note that there have been enormous steps forward in numbers of areas
4370055 a few people come here to be critical to dig into small details to find fault that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promise
4370056 people or protesters who want to express their personal opinions can go to do so
4370057 the protest application process clearly isnt about giving people greater freedom of expression but making it easier for the police to suppress it
4370058 i knew all along that for us to spurt we needed to play better on the road
4370059 we needed to put more runs on the board and thats exactly what we have done
4370060 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4370061 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4370062 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4370063 this is unbelievable its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be part of this team im inspired by other great athletes on the tennis team and in every team from swimming track and field everyone thats inspired me got me through this win
4370064 i wish i could have done much more but ive still got to look forward i look forward to the u s open and then the masters cup in shanghai try to save my season this obviously is a big blow but at the same time i know the danger of best of three set matches theyre over in a hurry
4370065 it turned when i didnt do what i needed to do
4370066 kobe bryant when i was little playing basketball was what i wanted to do either that or soccer
4370067 i was one of those guys at the parks and rec department i worked at a boring park and there was nobody there i like kids so i was expecting to play with kids but no kids
4370068 definitely a slice of pizza theyre quick you get a lot in
4370069 offensive player of the day charlie frye the third string quarterback looked sharp enough to start this saturdays exhibition which he probably will
4370070 vi har startat en unders kning och ska fatta ett beslut jag skulle nog hemskt g rna vilja byta h ftet mot n got annat
4370071 i talked it over with my family and i felt it was the best place for me
4370072 i like coach willingham i have a good relationship with the coaches i feel i have a good chance to play early this is the right place for me
4370073 hes really the one national level recruit from washington the guy who could play for just any top 20 program
4370074 if you can keep that top player in the state every year thats a great place to start
4370075 never be satisfied with the mediocre always aim to be better than you were yesterday
4370076 i just wanted to get in the top three and advance
4370077 that was my main focus and i did that im satisfied
4370078 the first round is nothing really lets see when we get to the finals
4370079 i hope you dont break up our 1 2 sweep

4370082 what i want to emphasize is that im coming home to play
4370083 im coming home to help the sounders win to help the sounders establish themselves as one of the top franchises in the country if not really the benchmark for what soccer is going to become in this country
4370084 i had offers to continue playing in the premier league and possibly go back to some of the other countries ive been to and its been a great journey
4370085 but to be a part of a new franchise to be a part of everything that i feel that this team is going to stand for it was just too good of an offer to pass up
4370086 i have a large degree of confidence that hell be if not the best goalkeeper in the league one of the top goalkeepers in the league
4370087 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4370088 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play
4370089 i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official

4370111 kalau bukan karena tidore tidak ada lagu dari sabang sampai merauke
4370112 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4370113 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4370114 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4370115 my personal point of view the lawsuit was a complete waste of time because the incident didnt rise to any kind of level i fly all the time ive seen a lot worse than that happen on airplanes
4370116 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4370117 it did collapse in the manner it was designed to collapse it just did not collapse when it was supposed to obviously
4370118 everything was progressing normally and then suddenly without warning a connection of one leg to the body seemed to fail
4370119 how do we know we would be the least attractive casino if we banned smoking
4370120 they were happy that they didnt have to get other peoples smoke in their hair and clothing
4370121 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4370122 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4370123 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4370124 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4370125 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4370126 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4370127 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4370128 both have exhibited a cooperative attitude and intend to work with the ade to fully implement the state mandate to the best of their ability
4370129 it is our belief at ade that a positive attitude is the most important part of the implementation process
4370130 biggest concern is consistency school by school and theres no way im going to have consistency based on the teachers we have
4370131 if a student is new to the country and new to the english language hell be in four hours of language development
4370132 but school by school were still going to need some more flexibility depending on staffing
4370133 will be based on staff and well have to tell ade how many hours we can do it
4370134 were just going to have to work with the state to get as close to the state model as we can within our resources but the ade understands the teachers we have are the teachers we have and the number of classrooms we have are the number of classrooms we have
4370135 they will look at three hours of immersion and then one hour of reading which can be in a content area but it still must focus on english instruction
4370136 districts cant mix ell kids with non ell kids even if they are newly classified kids who have just recently tested out of ell but still need the support in the classroom
4370137 and i dont think any district has 100 percent highly qualified teachers for those positions
4370138 want to see where the gaps are what are our data are telling us which will lead us to make adjustments to the services based on how our students are succeeding
4370139 the reason sunnyside submitted our alternative model is because the district and governing board had concerns about ell students being segregated for four hours a day for long periods of time
4370140 we would still hope as kids become more proficient say in reading then we would be able to reduce immersion by a reading hour or writing by a writing hour
4370141 constantly needs to look at how kids are making progress and what we need to do to move them forward
4370142 well be looking at proficiency levels and aims scores to justify fewer than four hours
4370143 and well be looking at keeping four hours but use content in them
4370144 the more proficient the more flexibility we will have to have fewer hours or to have the hours be more content driven
4370145 we know and the state knows were not going to be 100 percent in compliance the question is how close are we going to be able to get
4370146 were going to make every good faith effort to implement the four hours
4370147 not looking for us to be moving around staff this late in the game theyll let us work with existing staff and do it
4370148 we have a real commitment toward graduation for all kids and ell students should not be left behind
4370149 if school districts take full advantage of the many options available through the models that have been approved by a state task force i do not see being able to graduate on time as a problem at all
4370150 the state is not going to mandate how credit is to be awarded
4370151 we need to make sure ell students have the same positive opportunities to be an integral part of their school as any other student
4370152 we dont have a beef about them learning english but we dont want them left behind for other reasons
4370153 our hope is that the students will get the science credit in the science class but our main goal even there is to use it as an english language development class
4370154 important to learn english fast because i need it for my other classes and for me
4370155 thats because of a lot of effort on our part
4370156 some of the students will participate in sports and i also have an after school folklorico class so that gives them some contact
4370157 what did i read to you this morning in the newspaper
4370158 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4370159 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4370160 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4370161 for government if you can do something in less than two years its a miracle
4370162 there quite easily could be a doubling of a monthly payment
4370163 the condom fits 100 perfectly so the safety is much higher than a standard condoms and it feels more natural
4370164 it needs to be ready in five to 10 seconds
4370165 having condoms in different sizes we think is a good and smart idea
4370166 if one purchases a 6 million voting system one would expect it to count accurately
4370167 we had this game circled ever since it came out
4370168 a few of us felt like we needed this game to show we mean business and are serious about the gold medal
4370169 i had a lady cry when she came up to me
4370170 she came up to me asked me for an autograph and as i started to sign it she started crying literally crying i couldnt believe that i felt like the pope for a minute i just play basketball
4370171 we say it all the time we feel like the beatles
4370172 theres nothing like it the chinese have been outstanding whenever we leave the hotel go to the athletes village they are there urging us on its greatly appreciated and were going to need it
4370173 the other day it was pouring down raining and there was still a group outside of about 100 kids just waiting chasing the bus in the rain
4370174 we come out here every summer to do clinics and stuff like that and i have always been pretty popular but i dont know when this happened
4370175 i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous engraver
4370176 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon
4370177 we saw and tested the movie and we believe a strong movie deserves a strong playdate
4370178 my response simply was did you really just ask me that
4370179 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4370180 i got some great clothes from alexander wang and i miss samantha ronson cuz shes out of town have a wonderful day everyone
4370181 two years ago it was kabbalah last year it was alcoholics anonymous she was into peace for a while
4370182 the one thing it does show is her commitment to sam
4370183 being married is not something thats even in our minds
4370184 whats important to me is to have a home that is peaceful and healthy
4370185 meditate and encourage people to stop blaming others to be more responsible for their own well being
4370186 i felt empowerment and rage and despondency even giddiness and self abuse i ran the gamut
4370187 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4370188 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4370189 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4370190 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4370191 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4370192 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4370193 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4370232 i had a tape when i was little of nirvanas
4370233 one of my favorite jack kerouac quotes was from when he was writing on the road
4370234 someone asked him why he wrote the book and he said because were all gonna die its just trying to get out as much as you can before it happens its not being preoccupied with death its acknowledging the fact and not feeling like its a drag
4370235 the band was all raised with the same kind of christian upbringing and were kind of moving away from that im kind of agnostic but i definitely tend toward some spiritual feelings its more a desperation i think when people are feeling kind of down the old old blues singing about jesus i like songs where theres that desperate plea that old stuff theres a lot of hope in that too
4370236 who cares if i have to work thursday morning its radiohead
4370237 hey mark you want to watch the sonics game with me
4370238 its easier for me here to play consistently with a consistent group of musicians

4370240 the profile of donors means these individuals are hot prospects for a wide range of charity appeals particularly cancer and health and medical orientated causes as the individuals are proven to be generous to these areas and responsive to direct mail

4370247 farmers dont export archer daniels midland and cargill do the corporate commodity groups are continuing to push for bilateral ftas with south korea colombia and pushed for the recent peru fta meanwhile they also scheme to keep in place a broken us subsidy system that allows us farmers to be paid below cost of production and agribusiness to dump cheap commodities into overseas markets displacing farmers from mexico to indonesia to ghana to haiti with no benefit to us farmers
4370248 nffc has warned for over a decade that the wtos policies were impoverishing farmers both here and abroad and would lead to an inevitable food crisis the time has come for us to make food sovereignty not free trade our model and get the wto out of agriculture
4370249 the wto bears much responsibility for dismantling domestic and tariff protections and leaving countries at the mercy of volatile speculative markets for their food security as a u s farmer i fully support the right of india and the g 33 countries to implement a special safeguard mechanism ssm to protect their farmers and consumers from below cost imports flooding their markets i am deeply disappointed with other u s farm groups and our government for not endorsing the fundamental principle of food sovereignty
4370250 it is immoral for misguided free trade ideology to take precedence over the starvation of millions of people
4370251 the deregulation of agriculture as advocated by the wto has decimated family farms both here and abroad the u s commodity farm groups backed by agribusiness have propagandized for years that export markets would help family farmers when in reality it just fattens agribusinesss profits
4370252 farmers dont export archer daniels midland and cargill do the corporate commodity groups are continuing to push for bilateral ftas with south korea colombia and pushed for the recent peru fta meanwhile they also scheme to keep in place a broken u s subsidy system that allows u s farmers to be paid below cost of production and agribusiness to dump cheap commodities into overseas markets displacing farmers from mexico to indonesia to ghana to haiti with no benefit to u s farmers the wto promotes a globalized market where all farmers in different countries are pitted in a race to the bottom that only benefits agribusinesses that get access to the cheapest commodities possible we need domestic farm and food policies that respond to the needs of local communities nffcs food from family farms act would have accomplished this while curtailing dumping but congress chose to ignore our proposals during the farm bill
4370253 we have a food crisis water crisis climate crisis but the wto continues to promote export oriented agriculture that only leads to increased deforestation land concentration soil erosion bio diversity destruction and water contamination farmers producing food for local domestic markets have now been replaced by agro export industries such as cut rate flowers in kenya and colombia and devastating agrofuel plantations in brazil and indonesia producing sugar soya and palm oil instead of actual food to feed their citizens here in the u s this has led to monoculture production of corn and soybeans and factory farms instead of diversified farms producing healthy food for local markets
4370254 the perils of having a globalized centralized food system controlled by multinational corporations has been exposed as tainted pet food from china has killed our animals and salmonella tainted peppers from mexico have sickened americans across the country with the collapse of the doha round nffc looks forward to working for a global solution to the food crisis that supports family farmers pays workers a living wage sustains our ecological resources and fosters true democracy
4370255 at a time when dairy farmers in the u s and around the world are experiencing a dire crisis with the rise in our costs of production it is an outrage that u s trade negotiators are going along with the wtos radical deregulatory scheme based on 20 year old numbers from new zealand that have no connection to either current new zealand or u s conditions
4370256 our current costs of production hover over 30 cwt hundredweight it is obscene to sacrifice the livelihoods of dairy farmers our rural communities and our domestic milk production on the altars of a fatally flawed globalization agenda the last thing americans want in the midst of the food crisis is to become dependent on chinese powdered milk but that is the situation that confronts us as american dairy farmers keep going out of business
4370257 i like a good story as much as anybody i like ghost stories i like tall tales but dont call them science dont call them reality if theyre not what ive found is that the believers far more often ignore the skeptical answers than the skeptics ignore the believer
4370258 eventually we hope to feature artists crafters and new designers from all over the world
4370259 we wanted to choose a name that implied a certain randomness we believe strongly that art is a voyage of discovery its a winding sometimes completely indiscriminate road and you just have to have faith in the process art is a journey not a destination
4370260 it was the prayers of my mother and others that allowed me to survive when i could not pray for myself
4370261 at a time when i was literally dying i became distraught lost my faith and fell into depression however it was the prayers and resilience of those around me that saved my life
4370262 i came back to the u k and got wheeled off the plane a first i must say i felt a bit like elizabeth taylor

4370265 if we let all chinese people listen to god and follow god who will obediently listen to us and follow us
4370266 effectively gives permission to abcs producers to copy the underlying premise of a show without licensing the format
4370267 frapa and the international tv production industry have waited in vain for abc and or disney to respond to howard davines memo which if authentic is unacceptable both creatively and commercially
4370268 frapa believes in and fights for the intellectual property of formats frapa believes that formats belong to the people who create them and that they should not be used unlawfully by any third party even one as powerful as abc
4370269 in frapas view davines memo can be seen to be encouraging abc producers and show runners not to licence formats honestly
4370270 if this is found to be the case frapa will do everything in its power to help protect the property of its members in the international creative community
4370271 if abc and disney refuse to repudiate the contents of the davine memo then producers in both the us and around the world might note their silence and help themselves to the underlying premise of hannah montana
4370272 producers might even be persuaded by mr davines memo to be inspired by the general underlying premise of a well known disney cartoon character in the spirit of the memo the rip off rodent might be called tricky mouse
4370273 what is often overlooked or not fully appreciated are the complexities associated with negotiating format deals coupled with the fact that often times what is appealing in the format may be nothing more than a general underlying premise which in and of itself may be no reason to license the underlying property
4370274 we just focus on making the best wine we can make
4370275 and get it into the hands of competent distributors and support those distributors as much as possible
4370276 were the only wine they have at our price point
4370277 we want grocery stores wine shops restaurants to sell our wine
4370278 in trying to get distributors you have to accept rejection
4370279 because four out of five are simply going to reject you
4370280 what if some country invaded our georgia here in the us
4370281 i cant help wondering if russia would have been audacious enough to defy international law if there wasnt a trend in defying it set by the u s over the years
4370282 its been like this as far as i can remember we build houses then fighting occurs we leave and return home and build our houses again
4370283 being alive after all the troubles just makes me thankful despite the difficulties
4370284 for all intents and purposes any proposal for charter change even if its forced will be dead
4370285 if the constituent assembly has been convened it has plenary powers i dont think you can limit by law what the constituent assembly can take up
4370286 we dont want it to go up for too many consecutive days if it does the fall will be even more drastic
4370287 people are probably just profit taking from the recent rally
4370288 we have made progress but we will need your support to get the job done for the fundamental change in our political system
4370289 about is about getting the philippines back in the world map and putting the filipino people on the road to peace and prosperity permanently
4370290 we have to take the opportunity within a reasonable time frame because this is a long deliberate process that involves our future if we place this in the backburner for too long it could burn out and be lost forever
4370291 once we have proved to our people that we have done what we can within the present structure of government we can move on to changing the system to one that enhances our freedom and flexibility to do more i expect that next year congress will start considering the resolutions for charter change
4370292 the other message to send is that we will address the burden that the other philippine story imposes i refer to the story of how our political system has now become a hindrance to our national progress over the years our political system has degenerated to the extent that it is difficult for anyone to make any headway yet keep his hands clean to be sure the system is still capable of achieving great reforms but by and large our political system has betrayed its promise to each new generation of filipinos not a few of who are voting with their feet going abroad and leaving that system behind perhaps we politicians have done our best but maybe our best is not enough given the present system perhaps we have strained the present political system to its final limit it is time to turn to the people bring them into government and change the way that government is done the system clearly needs fundamental change and the sooner the better its time to start the great debate on charter change the mode of charter change is the exclusive prerogative of congress but a constituent assembly may well give our people the quickest reform
4370293 we have three fronts of struggle first the economy we must sustain our gains second charter change we must achieve this by the middle of this year third is poverty we must bring relief to the people battered by high oil prices and unemployment
4370294 i shall be at the helm of both the economy and pump priming program for social equity while congress and the local governments shall push the pincer attack on charter change gathering force behind the mandate of the people
4370295 tough decisions are also in the offing as we take up proposals for charter change i trust and hope that each sincere thought shall pour out of this gathering with the paramount interest of the people in mind we need to talk about charter change or the pace of the world could overwhelm us the time is now and i must stress this even if it invites controversy because im aware that we are a gathering of statespersons despite our disagreements we can only mold consensus from challenge and ferment in the marketplace of ideas
4370296 this is democracy in action and we must uphold it i extol those who fought for the peoples initiative for their patriotism perseverance and courage the great idea of charter reform lives on and we must keep the fire burning this is about creating a modern working philippines to leave behind the degenerated system that is holding the nation back and keeping it too poor and too divided
4370297 we have a vision of having the philippines join the ranks of first world nations by 2020 and a modern more cohesive and more accountable political structure is key to achieving that goal we leave it now to the concerned institutions as to how we can keep the dreams of the people ascendant and heed the imperatives of change
4370298 i commend the decision of the house leadership as an act of statesmanship to unify not only the two chambers of the legislature but the whole nation around the issue of charter change philippine democracy will always find the proper time and opportunity for charter reform at a time when the people deem it ripe and needful and in the manner they deem proper the nation must consolidate now and i call upon all our institutions and sectors to stand as one for the countrys future
4370299 for all intents and purposes any proposal for charter change even if its forced will be dead
4370300 if the constituent assembly has been convened it has plenary powers i dont think you can limit by law what the constituent assembly can take up
4370301 drive your most fuel efficient car car pool or ride the bus combine errands to reduce car trips avoid using gasoline powered lawn mowers and other yard equipment as well as gas fueled sports vehicles refuel your car in cooler evening hours
4370302 as i see it there arent any problems in the u s
4370303 this is an act of aggression which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
4370304 green growth is a future strategy that will enable a miracle on the to succeed the miracle on the han river
4370305 face up to history and refrain from making the foolish mistake of repeating the unfortunate past again today
4370306 the will create several times more jobs than existing industries
4370307 even if soaring oil prices drop in the years to come now is the time for us to bid farewell to the era of excessive oil dependence
4370308 i have expectations that pyongyang will come forward for comprehensive dialogue and economic cooperation because now is the most opportune time for the north to make change
4370309 its absolutely out of the ordinary and shocking to everybody around here both the university and the neighbors
4370310 man he must have had to go one hell of a long way to get your mail

4370313 i pay rs 500 a month to the taliban as per their decree i can afford to pay the sum otherwise it would have been great injustice
4370314 that is true we provide a certain quantity of fuel to the taliban as per their desire and our contribution for jihad
4370315 any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations
4370316 the united nations has never accepted and does not accept and i do not believe it will ever accept the principle of secession of a part of a member state
4370317 this is plain lokohan foolishness and the milf cannot allow this to happen
4370318 the milf has told the government of the republic of the philippines that its options to solve the moro problem are reduced to only two choose vice governor emmanuel pi ol and his company who are pushing for war or to continue the path of peace with the milf
4370319 if the government wants the talks to progress it can do it it can think creatively but if it wants to stick to the constitution things will not move
4370320 never for a single moment did we talk about the sabah claim with malaysia as facilitator it is only practical for us not to bring that up or include sabah in our proposed homeland we are silent on the issue we never said it belongs to the bangsamoro people just as we never said it does not belong to us it is a nonissue for us at this point
4370321 probably respresents compression rather than invasion although the latter cannot be totally excluded
4370322 as there was an honorable exchange today we are determined to have an honorable exchange for our own prisoners held in israeli jails
4370323 there is a captive israeli soldier and thousands of our sons are in prison
4370324 today is a great victory for the resistance movements and to hezbollah said hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri
4370325 it shows that the only successful way to free the prisoners is by kidnapping soldiers

4370332 this class turned my entire perception of real estate investing upside down when i told my friends i was buying at over ninety cents on the dollar and making over 50 000 a month they started laughing their censored off and thought i was nuts theyre not laughing anymore
4370333 if this class was offered by anyone other than the roddy family i would have thought it was a scam and never signed up but i know the roddys are as good as it gets in real estate and i jumped in man was i glad i did
4370334 only 54 percent of eligible american voters cast their ballots half of them are only voting cause its cool to vote for so and so they arent even up to date on information

4370337 obama doesnt know what he doesnt know and thats what makes him so dangerous
4370338 the whole world is on fire and where exactly is our congressional leadership eating ribs at an election bbq fundraiser or partying in beijing
4370339 liberal content is definitely a factor in the coming demise of the printed media or at least in the newspaper end of it
4370340 if this is not war then i wonder what is
4370341 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders we on our own cannot fight with russia
4370342 this is the peoples house this is not pelosis politiburo
4370343 the fact that democrats left before getting their work done is highly disappointing
4370344 opponents to the ban are using the same arguments theyve used for any legislation that attempts to limit abortion
4370345 they argue that it denies access to abortion for women that the procedure actually never takes place that this is an attempt at opening a small door into eventually banning all abortions
4370346 california could lose several tens of millions of dollars in sales tax if same sex marriage were banned

4370350 qat contributes about 5 percent of gdp some 29 percent of the total agricultural value added it absorbs 1 4 of agricultural workforce however it is one of the key
4370351 that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
4370352 we are much more worried by georgian imperialism than russian imperialism
4370353 it is closer to us and we feel its pressure all the time
4370354 russia has legitimate interests in its neighborhood but the means they are using are no way to pursue them
4370355 i want the people of your country to know the american people care deeply about the people of burma and we pray for the day in which the people will be free
4370356 we are here because china is the main supporter of the military regime
4370357 the cause of burmas freedom democracy and human rights was poignantly served but whether mr bush and his wifes gestures will make any difference on the ground is doubtful
4370358 twenty years have gone by and everything is still the same or maybe worse in burma
4370359 described being shown to many men before being chosen and sold
4370360 every day we are busy with hardware and software as our ammunition any way we can but theres never any answer
4370361 i wish there was a magic wand to wave there isnt on the other hand the people that are listening to your radio broadcast has got to know that the president of the united states and a lot of other people in america are concerned and care about how they live and want them to be free
4370362 whether that happens tomorrow or not is doubtful i make no promises to your listeners except that well continue to try

4370369 residents of district 7 for example in englewood coped with 1 400 violent incidents between january and june of this year
4370370 if you have a lot of movement of poor people and poor people and their kids are involved in gangs adults are involved in the drug game there is no free place you can move to

4370372 were in a cycle now in which housing declines already are greater than at any time since the great depression of the 30s and were not at the bottom yet if you dont want to be disappointed by housing performance in the near term disregard forecasts that the bottom is just around the corner unless that corner is in timbuktu the bottom is not coming soon we will stay at the bottom for quite a while

4370385 the flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years

4370387 it is very wrong to teach that you can draw material things to yourself by the use of mental forces you should teach that people must work for what they get
4370388 it is interesting that they import a lot of books on the soviet union and soviet characters
4370389 but i find it strange to see books on lenin trotsky marx and others but not a single book written by those authors
4370390 for real they actually sell our stuff at virgin megastore

4370410 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4370411 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4370412 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4370413 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4370414 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4370415 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4370416 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4370417 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4370418 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4370419 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4370420 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4370421 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4370422 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4370423 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4370424 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4370425 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4370426 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4370427 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4370428 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4370429 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4370430 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4370431 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4370432 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4370433 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4370438 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4370439 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4370440 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4370441 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4370442 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4370443 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4370445 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4370446 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4370447 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4370448 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4370449 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4370450 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4370451 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4370452 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4370453 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4370454 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4370455 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4370456 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4370457 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4370458 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4370459 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4370460 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4370461 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4370462 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4370463 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4370464 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4370465 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4370466 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4370467 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4370468 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4370471 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4370472 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

4370476 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4370477 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

4370494 het eerste halfjaar van 2008 kenmerkte zich door ongekende bewegingen in de financi le markten en een inverse rentecurve
4370495 de gevolgen daarvan waren onder andere een grote terughoudendheid bij beleggers en sterke concurrentie op de spaarmarkt
4370496 de marktomstandigheden bleven voor alle marktpartijen uitdagend ook voor nibc
4370497 nibc blijft profiteren van haar sterke kapitaalpositie in de huidige turbulente markt we beschikken over een krachtig platform voor verdere groei echter de markten blijven waarschijnlijk uitdagend

4370505 shes glad she got back together with him to give things another go
4370506 with all due respect to the league i think this incident was unacceptable and at this time inexcusable im sure there is a reasonable explanation for this but i havent heard one yet
4370507 the players are the reason this league exists and i think the nwfl should respond appropriately
4370508 theres an erotic section on this web site and while most web sites dont want it to be blatant sex for sale some of the ads are blatant and others have innuendo that let viewers know that its sex for sale
4370509 but where legal conduct between consenting adults is concerned we feel it is important to err on the side of respecting free speech and privacy rights
4370510 the incidence of crime on craigslist is actually very low considering the tens of millions of ads that are posted each month and together with craigslist users and law enforcement we are working continually to eliminate it
4370511 after following up on craigslist activity from our last multijurisdictional sting in november 2007 we determined there was a need for another investigation
4370512 we found there were still a significant number of ads having an overtone of sex for sale in south snohomish county
4370513 june as i recall was really wet but weve maintained our schedule
4370514 were allowing ourselves time to finish punch list types of items transitioning parking back to this facility before we actually open it to the public
4370515 its one element of a series of direct access projects to allow our regional express vehicles to operate as much as possible in the high occupancy vehicle lanes
4370516 we have worked continuously with sound transit in the design of this station to help make access easier and more enjoyable to get from our bus facilities to this new station
4370517 weve provided an exterior walkway to bring people down to our bus zones
4370518 weve incorporated some art along this walkway which will help make it a little more enjoyable and safer for patrons
4370519 what i have seen of the process so far is that citizens took seriously the opportunity to tell us what they like and would change about our community
4370520 that kind of got me thinking wow if i could be on the other side and help people that could be exciting on a larger scale
4370521 to me its being able to touch the people that really need help the most
4370522 weve been fighting very hard day and night for four days but after today the water level should recede
4370523 having a cultural event alongside the sport brings a totally different set of eyeballs to beijing and the olympics and its great to have this harmony of sport and music
4370524 chinese people love opera dating back to the tradition of chinese opera and they are very open and interested in the whole western opera scene
4370525 our friends will get a chance to better understand enjoy and embrace the splendid achievements and fascinating charms of china its culture and arts while we can experience theirs
4370526 these activities will definitely improve interactions between the western and eastern cultures and spread the olympic spirit in china
4370527 we didnt know if they would react to the western style music we play if not what do you use
4370528 chinese music is just not so rocky and poppy we need people up there stamping their feet if theyre sitting down and swaying gently its not so great

4370535 i think it serves to make my point really that weve got all these badges that are lost and we dont know where they are and they absolutely look like a badge and can be utilized by anyone who finds them to impersonate a peace officer
4370536 if you look at projected rates of acidity for the year 2100 we are finding a 25 percent reduction in fertilization
4370537 we were completely surprised because people had been looking at the effect of acidification on calcified structures of marine animals but there was no evidence to suggest it was affecting non calcified structures like a sperm or an egg
4370538 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species
4370539 the paper has looked at the projected rates within the next 80 years but we have actually looked at higher acidification values and we have had mortality of the animals
4370540 they couldnt be hurt that bad because they both split
4370541 just speculating its possible it could be a drunk driver involved they could be unlicensed and felt they could get in trouble
4370542 its fairly common to have an accident and have one driver gone but to have both drivers run away thats unusual
4370543 he couldnt get it because i had it close to my body and i had the strap way up over my elbow when he pulled it he hurt my arm he couldnt get it off my arm
4370544 what could i do it was just my instinct it was frightening if you ever had that happened to you its a terrible thing an invasion of your property
4370545 i dont know how she could fight this guy off hes very big and husky
4370546 this woman comes from the old school she believes in the american way shes a strong woman and shes not willing to let someone take something that belongs to her
4370547 she knew it was dangerous but shes proud and she doesnt want to be a victim of a crime shed make a great cop she reminds me a lot of my grandmother
4370548 the government isnt just our government its our employer too so it has to sort out public service pay policy
4370549 if it doesnt it will lead to conflict throughout the coming year
4370550 commissioning private sector firms may bring about cheaper public services in the short term but it will never ever bring about the quantum leap in quality that the government will need before it goes into the next election
4370551 we have concluded that this proposed sale is not in the public interest and will likely create a significant effect on the availability or accessibility of healthcare services to the affected community
4370552 anaheim memorial medical center is an important healthcare facility and we hope this latest setback does not jeopardize its future
4370553 reflects fair market value and is consistent with the public interest
4370554 i think its a disappointment to those of us here who wanted to see an ownership be established and move forward with necessary capital improvements
4370555 were still in limbo and our owner no longer wants us
4370556 the environment is not being taken very seriously in most of the emerging markets because we havent started feeling the pressure yet
4370557 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned fat prophets analyst gavin wendt said
4370558 we saw spot oil prices hit a record high of us147 per barrel and that has to have a positive rub off on their earnings
4370559 while the market is generally aware of cost pressures throughout the industry we are concerned that there is a tendency to underestimate the quantum of cost increases goldman sachs jbwere said in a client note

4370564 what are you feeling now alicia are you ashamed your failure sickens me

4370567 the act government will commit up to 2 5 million as part of an initial trust fund for the development of the team
4370568 then as part of our national league funding we will commit similar support to this team as we do to the raiders and brumbies
4370569 i see sport as a major driver of tourism in the act
4370570 we have a wonderful facility here at canberra stadium we want to see it utilised more
4370571 across the suite of portfolios i hold i see it as an important economic sporting and social driver for the act
4370572 this is a wonderful commitment from the act government its going to make a massive difference in terms of the prospects of an a league team in canberra for the 2010 11 season
4370573 the truth was i wrestled with what it meant and how much weight i should have given to those problems with the catholic kids
4370574 how much weight do we give to things that are happening now
4370575 it has certainly been really enlightening to have so much interfaith dialogue
4370576 understand and appreciate the interwoven history of both of our faiths
4370577 why dont you start talking about what we have in common
4370578 the u s catechism tells us that this is the fabric of our own identity threads that are woven together through the fabric of our common heritage
4370579 he wanted to have a meeting with interfaith leaders he also carved out a meeting that would just be with jewish leadership
4370580 we are at a point where we can recognize the tragedy of the holocaust and move into another understanding this helps build that sense of commonality in our humanity
4370581 were not just victims but they went on to flourish
4370582 spore was very much inspired by many different types of sciences
4370583 we spent a lot of time meeting a lot of scientists very early on in developing this game to find out what areas would be interesting to bring into the game
4370584 were using spore as a nexus for explaining these theories on evolutionary biology
4370585 millions of people contribute content like planets buildings and creatures to your game but its not real time
4370586 youre seeing copies of peoples stuff so you can go up and blow up a planet and you havent ruined their experience
4370587 youre basically killing each other to see whos got the better imaginary friend
4370588 when two opposite points of view are expressed with equal intensity the truth does not necessarily lie exactly halfway between them it is possible for one side to be simply wrong
4370589 religion is fundamentally opposed to everything i hold in veneration courage clear thinking honesty fairness and above all love of the truth
4370590 the trouble is that god in this sophisticated physicists sense bears no resemblance to the god of the bible or any other religion
4370591 so many swimmers have swum so well here so the pressure was gone the relay was behind me so i just eased into it without feeling too much pressure
4370592 i wasnt expecting a medal i just focused on myself and sometimes the outcome is not what you expect
4370593 it definitely wouldnt have been the same if she hadnt been there i was the record holder now she has it and you want to race the best
4370594 i wouldnt have wanted to win without her there and never known what would have happened if she had been there she is the world record holder but didnt win gold that is sport
4370595 we hope our installations will bring about a net cooling of the area and if the melt is not stopped that it is at least slowed

4370609 the proposed transaction structure was unattractive for shareholders as they would become minority shareholders in a company controlled by adecco

4370619 die einzige figur in italiens filmwelt die wirklich spannend ist die radikal eigene wege geht
4370620 der kommt immer gern im studio vorbei und erz hlt uns was bers leben
4370621 einen anfang und ein ende einen h hepunkt einen tiefpunkt eine durststrecke einen ekstasepart usw ich wollte ein zweiteiliges ding haben der erste teil der einen popappeal hat eine gewisse leichtigkeit sp rbar macht und f r den zweiten teil dieses kinoding einen filmischen soundtrack ohne film der wunsch ist nat rlich immer da dass man was macht was einzigartig ist und lange bestand hat
4370622 pelo nome pelo que representa pelo futebol que tem jogado ele merece
4370623 ele tem que comandar a equipe o mais experiente 28 anos chegou com desconfian a sele o ol mpica mas est muito bem estamos muito felizes vai daqui para melhor
4370624 for a da sele o vai fazer a diferen a
4370625 in july fixed asset investment again accelerated to a certain extent
4370626 thats positive for tackling the issues arising from a weakening in external demand
4370627 urban fixed asset investment has maintained a growth level of about 25 percent every month
4370628 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4370629 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4370630 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4370631 for a da sele o vai fazer a diferen a
4370632 such information is needed by both sides to prepare for arguments in the debate it will not be fair if he has access to information and i dont
4370633 i knew it was time to get up and go to work
4370634 its been a lot of hard work but the biggest part that goes into it is the translation of the information of the words and phrases the plays are all the same most teams run the same type of plays its just what you call them hes definitely making progress
4370635 he knows the plays they just dont come off his tongue as easily because hes been doing it one way for so many years and now its new hes definitely making progress
4370636 ill be a lot further along than i was last year the more i rest the more i take care of my ankle ill be close to 100 if im not 100 ill probably be 95 96 which ill definitely take
4370637 it was the first time i actually ran and played on them
4370638 its going to take some time for me to get used to it once i get past that stage i think ill be out here from there
4370639 my feet are not in the same position that theyve been in for the first 30 years of my life so theyre not comfortable with it
4370640 theyre sore but i think ill be all right its just about me getting used to them
4370641 i know theres going to be times where i go out and jam it a few times or get tackled or things like that
4370642 i know thats going to happen im just trying to prevent those things from happening by getting it as strong as i can get it and me just getting back to being myself
4370643 iedereen kan zeggen wat hij of zij wil maar ik ben schoon dat weet ik zeker mensen kunnen vragen wat ze willen maar feiten zijn feiten en die bewijzen dat ik niks gebruik
4370644 het draait om de juiste toewijding en ook om rust ik zorg er tussen alle nummers voor dat ik zoveel mogelijk slaap
4370645 ik wist niet dat er zo weinig tijd tussen zat na de huldiging moest ik weer een pak aan en mijn badmuts op en gaan maar het ging allemaal goed
4370646 they appeared before the court today zarganar a ka a maung thura was charged with 7 counts of charges and zaw thet htwe with 2 counts of charges the court started hearing today on case charged with section 505 b of criminal code the cross examination made by prosecution not yet finished
4370647 the prosecution submits his photos appeared in exile media websites such as mizzima news and irrawady as exhibitions the prosecution claimed all these exhibits made disaffection towards state and government and also they submit the transcriptions of radio interview given by zarganar to bbc and voa
4370648 i felt the same feeling as a mother when sons of other people faced the same fate now i am dumb with these my son did for the sake of the country irrespective of how many counts of charges they put on my son dont mind this is my feeling on hearing this news
4370649 kalau yang sedang dalam masa persidangan kita cermati kesaksian kesaksian yang telah ada di persidangan nanti kita lihat apakah bisa ditindaklanjuti atau tidak karena ini kan baru pokoknya kita dalami semua
4370650 tapi yang jelas yang telah kita lakukan kita menginventarisir semua keterangan mereka di pengadilan
4370651 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4370652 ill support any decision taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia
4370653 and we not only support these decisions but will guarantee them in the caucasus and in the world
4370654 i think we can forget about talking about georgias territorial integrity
4370655 we do not want georgias breakup but neither the south ossetians nor the abkhaz want to live in the same state with a man who sends his troops against them
4370656 are not in gori have never been in gori and do not occupy gori
4370657 i would have felt very confident at the time that the top place to look was at ft detrick
4370658 weve always suspected something was going on but this is the first time it has been properly documented
4370659 this is a real find for a time period that is not very well documented in that part of the world
4370660 there is absolutely no reason for anyone to go there
4370661 that has more dinosaurs in it of high quality than any other rock in the continent of africa
4370662 at this point it is hard to see why anyone would stick their neck out for gen musharraf
4370663 i am celebrating our independence which i feel is near
4370664 who would have ever thought it would be zardari accusing someone else of embezzlement
4370665 we knew those dogs should not be allowed to die
4370666 i give bad rap a lot of credit for what was accomplished with the vick dogs
4370667 for once these dogs were not destroyed dismissed as ticking time bombs they were seen for what they are as victims
4370668 exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters
4370669 in particular a person can commit the offence even when he or she did not intend members of the public to be directly or indirectly encouraged by his or her statement to commit acts of terrorism but where his or her statement was understood by some members of the public as encouragement to commit such acts
4370670 libel lawyers in this country have remained insouciant to the deficiencies highlighted by the un
4370671 free speech has been a victim of the war on terror with offences of encouragement and glorification of terrorism threatening to make careless talk a crime
4370672 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states
4370673 obamas people know that they have not closed the deal with hillary voters the way they would like and they just cant afford to do anything real or perceived that upsets mrs clinton and her followers so they have more than bent over to accommodate her
4370674 you do worry and i think that was something that concerned her as well
4370675 what is the turnout going to be is anyone coming to my party
4370676 she sought to be the first woman nominated for president she came up a little short but she made it easier for the next female candidate to get the brass ring many in the democratic party would like to celebrate that i think that they should celebrate that
4370677 the good thing about this staff is theyre brutally honest
4370678 it hurts some guys egos but thats the way it is youre either in or out
4370679 changes in schedule for launches are a regrettable but a routine part of launching
4370680 now we make them one or 1 stories its more cozy
4370681 were also putting gathering areas as an extension of the kitchen with a fireplace and seating area because people love to be near food when theyre entertaining
4370682 some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next
4370683 we aim to deliver a bmw condo at an oldsmobile price
4370684 we get our tile for half price from suppliers in texas
4370685 in this slow market it absolutely takes longer to sell
4370686 but there was a real charm about this place which is on a quiet street and it had a nice backyard for the twins to play in
4370687 the more i thought of the possibilities and potential for added space the more i wanted to keep it
4370688 the original layout gave the house a cramped cheese maze feeling with tiny rooms and tunnel like hallways
4370689 which means two of the bedrooms on the second floor had to be smaller
4370690 its easy to include them in larger custom houses but we designed a floor plan that works for townhouses that were marketing to people who are selling a bigger house
4370691 it helps create the feel of a traditional single family house for people who are used to having the extra space
4370692 touches on ground that most other groups dont even know exists
4370693 del potro could be a little tired but hes on such a roll
4370694 when youre on a roll like that the last thing thats going to stop you is fatigue so i dont think that will play a role today
4370695 its kind of cool to see my face up there
4370696 i have a lot of fun playing in that stadium and i hope that i can keep it up
4370697 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4370698 i proved that i played with the best tonight and it couldnt have happened to me on a better stage
4370699 he had ambitions to go to college but his top priority was to go as a student because he wanted to be an engineer
4370700 if he was able to play football that was a bonus
4370701 the whole team was over here last night not just the chapel hill high team but we had kids over here from east chapel hill high and carrboro high
4370702 atlas was just a very bright very excellent person kind to everybody a gentle giant
4370703 atlas was one of the people that was gifted he didnt even have to study this year he was going to be in ap statistics
4370704 based on the records that we have it appears that there was no contamination
4370705 looking further into the records we had a permit that was issued
4370706 its just hard coming off the individual competition you fence so hard and you only have so many days later
4370707 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4370708 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4370709 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4370710 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4370711 i have difficulty with the notion of punishing minors for the actions of their parents
4370712 we have to ask do we want them here without an education or with an education and a degree with which they can be better citizens
4370713 i think for us to change course in the middle of this stream to me borders on the point of being absurd
4370714 we wanted room for our three dogs and we were able to get the house we wanted with a big yard here for much less than in towns to the north or east
4370715 this is a small enough town where people participate but big enough that we have everything we need and can get to chicago in about an hour
4370716 you can get a lot of house for your money here
4370717 its not like when we came here and you knew everyones name
4370718 but its still small enough that the kids are safe and you know their friends
4370719 der drastische nachfrageabschwung nach lcd panels ist nicht unn tigerweise eine schlechte sache f r die industrie da dies m glicherweise zu einer fr her als zu erwartenden knappheit am markt 2009 f hren k nnte
4370720 generell sehen auch wir eine marktberuhigung dies hat speziell f r europa auch damit zu tun dass die konjunktur schw chelt die internationale funkausstellung kurz bevorsteht und sich kunden zum jetzigen zeitpunkt mit neuanschaffungen eher zur ckhalten
4370721 people may be going through a break up or they are suffering depression they may be vulnerable to these sorts of things she said
4370722 the evidence is that credit card default is related to unemployment illness and family breakdown not bank marketing he said in a statement
4370723 the australian bankers association does not believe that there is a sound argument for credit card limit offers to be banned by government regulation
4370724 we found that lenders frame their letters in various ways to make it more likely customers will not really think too hard about taking on more debt and just accept the limit increase he said
4370725 the letters trigger the natural human instinct to trust experts in this case experts who have already determined you can afford a limit increase
4370726 now people want bedrooms upstairs and separate living and dining areas eat in kitchens and family rooms on the first floor all with a greater amount of openness and spaciousness which can be a challenge
4370727 australia at 10 per cent makes it tougher for local manufacturers in competing and drawing innovation and new technology to australia mr reuss said
4370728 we need to look at this on a fair playing field basis theres other countries out there that value their automotive industry greatly their tariffs reflect that
4370729 if it tariffs has to decrease wed like a more gradual decrease as an industry we are pretty united on that the tariff is a big issue for us
4370730 it was supposed to be a picture that inspired the olympic spirit
4370731 we have nothing to say about the issue no comment
4370732 great read every day makes me smile as rab muses about music and his irreverant views on the eu tune in you wont be disappointed
4370733 excellent blog which can be controversial at times while maintaining its humour keep it up big rab
4370734 updated every day with doses of good humour political satire a running commentary on the progress of authors home football team and his life
4370735 i knew this could open up so many womens wardrobes
4370736 all women have that clothing in the back of their closet that they don t wear because they don t like the way it looks
4370737 the trial must proceed even through the defendant is absent because they earlier agreed to allow the hearing to go on
4370738 and the daughters of jerusalem would go out and dance in the vineyards located on the outskirts of the city and everyone who didnt have a wife would go there
4370739 by the end of the 1980s i had definitely come to the conclusion that scripture was not dealing with the predicament of persons whom we should recognise as homosexual by nature i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
4370740 i put 30 effort in making the ring entrance 50 for a fight and 20 for talking to the fans and media in japan
4370741 i always try to entertain fans as much as i can like dj ozma does through the ring entrance the fight and talking to fans in japan
4370742 but theres a difference between doing them the ring entrances in pride fc in japan and in the ufc in the states i think its a cultural difference
4370743 thats why he helped me to make the best ring entrance in mma history in pride bushido 13
4370744 obviously the ufc is the best mma organization in the world
4370745 so im really thrilled to fight in the ufc my goal is not to become just a ufc fighter my goal is to become the champion of the world the ufc welterweight champ
4370746 but i had a big concern about the ring entrance which unfortunately tanked
4370747 i was puzzled at the big difference between fighting in the ring in pride and fighting in the octagon
4370748 besides i broke my right hand at the beginning of the fight it made it tough to fight with a broken hand but somehow i managed to win and it was a relief after the fight was over i think it was good that i won the fight with a broken right hand believe me the pain was killing me
4370749 its the first time fighting in england and im thrilled
4370750 he hardy has a hard left hook likes to fight standing and is preparing for the fight in the united states i have the advantage of experience but hardy is younger and has a long reach so we are quite evenly matched
4370751 i think im a student that needs to learn things from this fight as well
4370752 so its good if we both can learn a lot of things through the fight i think we are both students
4370753 no matter what they the fans do and no matter what they think about me a fight is a fight
4370754 that would be so awesome i hope i dont offend anyone though
4370755 its the first ufc event thats going to be on tv in japan for 18 months so i really want to win the fight for the japanese mma fans as much as hardy wants to win for his english fans in order for that to happen im going to work hard by the way ill feel really bad if i send the english fans home in tears with my victory i think the english are cool people

4370758 a couple could pretend to be joking before attacking the target
4370759 this would lead to his eyes nose and mouth being plugged and loses the ability to breathe
4370760 this type of weapon is excellent in close combat where fire arms are not desirable
4370761 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned fat prophets analyst gavin wendt said
4370762 we saw spot oil prices hit a record high of us147 per barrel and that has to have a positive rub off on their earnings
4370763 while the market is generally aware of cost pressures throughout the industry we are concerned that there is a tendency to underestimate the quantum of cost increases goldman sachs jbwere said in a client note
4370764 early eating patterns have implications for attainment that appear to persist over time regardless of subsequent changes in diet
4370765 there was no relationship between school meals or packed lunch consumption and later attainment once the junk food dietary pattern prior to school entry and other confounding factors were introduced in the analysis
4370766 this research highlights the importance of diet before entry into formal education for later school attainment and calls for a concerted effort between schools families government departments and other agencies to improve the nutritional intake of children
4370767 whatever you do you bastard dont f in kick me just dont f in kick me
4370768 in all that time ive never seen a more controversial choice
4370769 because of both the language and the sophistication of the story its not a comfortable or happy reading experience
4370770 but it has been recognised for its artistic excellence and the brilliance of the story and we are an awards for literary merit
4370771 however the weather closed in again and the helicopter was forced to return to mt cook
4370772 land search and rescue teams are currently unable to get in to the area due to the avalanche risk
4370773 they have done the right thing and put their intentions in
4370774 sometimes i catch myself thinking and wondering just how it is that i ended up being the coach of the russian national team and being a part of that tradition russia is no longer the u s s r and im no longer that 13 year old boy things happen but they happen for a reason
4370775 the amazing thing ive found and its good that it is that way is that basketball is basketball
4370776 the great equalizer is the game itself the places and the political circumstances and the faces may change but the game it advances but its basically the same its probably what naismith had in mind when he created it
4370777 were all recreating bits and pieces of things weve learned along the way
4370778 i dont have any particular burning desire to work in the nba
4370779 if a situation presented itself that was satisfying and fulfilling to me on a professional level then id certainly consider it
4370780 so far no ones knocked my door down and they certainly dont have to but if you look around europe im probably one of the easiest guys to cross over because i have the background and the high level euro experience
4370781 there is less kidnapping and killing but the militiamen are still there though they are not armed in the streets
4370782 sinatra considered himself first and foremost an interpreter of song and his influence on other entertainers is incalculable he has become so thoroughly entrenched in the history of american popular song that it is impossible to open your mouth and sing without his influence being part of that
4370783 literally copy what he did i have a different point of view i was interested in reflecting his taste in music i wanted to create an album that would explore his style of singing and his style of music the actual swing sound we attribute to sinatra was created by nelson riddle they consciously decided at one point in the early 1950s that they were going to create a new sound and a new way to interpret these songs its a sound that reflects a certain era even though it was only part of that era and i find it fascinating that it has transcended the time in which it was created to become almost a generic sound so this album is not only a tribute to sinatra but also to his collaborators to nelson riddle and also to billy may axel stordahl and the dozens of other musicians with whom he worked through the years from count basie to quincy jones don costa skip martin johnny mandel etc
4370784 is an homage to nelsons ive got you under my skin it was great fun to do that because people will think theyve heard it before even though its brand new
4370785 because sinatra was so strongly associated with him i thought it would be fun to take another mchugh song and billy may ize it
4370786 sinatras influence on american popular music is probably more thoroughly documented than any other entertainer
4370787 wanted to do something that reflected sinatras 1940s recordings with axel stordahl and evoke that era i approached thomas lauderdale of pink martini about doing a collaboration and he was very enthusiastic about it to me pink martini is one of the great modern interpreters of world music and this particular style i sent him the two recordings of joan crawford and sinatra he called back and said how about doing it a little slower as maybe a cuban mambo sorta thing so i flew up to portland and we did it live all in one room we evolved the arrangement that thomas had worked out and china forbes their vocalist and i started doing takes by the fifth take we thought wed nailed it stylistically it is something thats closest to sinatras 40s efforts
4370788 in a certain way i am sinatra had a very distinctive style of phrasing that has been picked up by a lot of people in conscious imitation but its more difficult to generally evoke his style i listened to a lot of his records paying attention to how he phrased not to do a carbon copy but to get a proper sense of it one thing his did was to backphrase just a little bit often hed be right on the beat but sometimes he backphrased today the tendency of singers is to backphrase a lot extreme backphrasing has evolved through the decades and makes the songs sound more contemporary for me in a detrimental way because when you backphrase a lot and slow up the tempo it affects the overall texture of the song
4370789 it is still one of the best studios in the world and one of the last surviving ones i think of all the great singers who in addition to sinatra have recorded there including nat cole peggy lee and judy garland
4370790 as close as we could to the early stereo sound on those capitol records there was a certain kind of clarity and simplicity in the sound that is missing today because bands are now miked quite differently than they were in the 50s when i listen to pop recordings of these standards the first thing i hear is an antiseptic sound in the bass and drums thats usually a giveaway that its a newer recording because the classic recordings had the drums live in the room with the rest of the instruments and there was bleed into the rest of the microphones nobody does that anymore because theyre so afraid of the drums overpowering the rest of the section recording has become a victim of technology in that the overall sound isnt as warm and cohesive or perhaps as honest for the sinatra project sessions everybody was in one room except me i was in a booth as sinatra was it took us about 40 minutes to balance the live sound it was very exciting even though the musicians were a little doubtful at first its something ive wanted to do for years but no one would let me bill has wanted to do it too when i first recorded with bill back in 1995 we talked about doing this but no one would let us but with him being the producer as well as the arranger on this album he said were going to do it this way everyone went along with it and once it started coming together everybody got very excited because there was that early 50s transparent stereo sound that gave a sheen to the music
4370791 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4370792 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4370793 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4370794 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4370795 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4370796 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4370797 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4370798 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4370799 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4370800 this study will be critical to our working out a reasoned policy on this hot potato issue
4370801 im against allowing illegal immigrants who can never work legally in north carolina to attend community colleges in north carolina
4370802 i have shown it to a lot of people and they absolutely love the building and see community theatre as a perfect match for the space
4370803 the main reason we are entertaining the community theatre offer is that they want to preserve that building
4370804 we dont want to see it torn down for some other kind of development
4370805 the challenge is where they get the 2 million were committed out right now
4370806 but not down south to the black sea and georgia
4370807 he has restored our pride a russian told me while i was in moscow
4370808 larrys about the most positive person ive ever met and ive met a lot of them
4370809 theres nothing that gets him down on the golf course or in life thats one of the things i really respect about him
4370810 you wont find a more kind hearted guy than bobby
4370811 his whole demeanor is to take care of everybody because he really cares about everybody he meets
4370812 i know i had certain advantages growing up that he didnt
4370813 if larry would have had what i had growing up he would have run past me like there was no tomorrow
4370814 and what exactly are you going to do for me
4370815 whatever you want me to do i guess you just tell me what it is and i know i can do it
4370816 other clubs will tell you they have the best guy running their locker room but trust me they dont
4370817 bobbys like family to me and id do anything for family
4370818 you come across a lot of people in your life
4370819 i pull it out now and then and read it because its so beautiful
4370820 id do anything for bobby and i know hed do anything for me
4370821 the dod the nations biggest polluter is now cleaning up 29 500 currently or formerly contaminated sites in every state and territory
4370822 gave my mother enough security to keep us together and keep us focused on a time when things would improve by having our most basic needs covered
4370823 evolutionary science is as much about the posturing salesmanship stonewalling and bullying as it is about actual scientific theory
4370824 conform unei sentinte a judecatoriei sectorului 1 din 2003 anca petrescu are o condamnare cu inchisoarea pentru furt
4370825 doamna anca petrescu lasati o pe asta cu pascutul dumneavoastra puteti sa va duceti la pascut ati furat si trebuia sa faceti puscarie
4370826 he had an uncommon sense of devotion to this place
4370827 there were no limits on his hours and dedication he lived the work
4370828 it represents the best thing that the people of north carolina have that they built themselves
4370829 god gave them their mountains and beautiful beaches and their gorgeous piedmont but the people of north carolina built their university
4370830 chancellor fordham is rightly regarded as the driving force behind a period of extraordinary success at carolina
4370831 we will never forget his deep love for this place
4370832 here at gtcc the books are more than the tuition
4370833 its extremely frustrating because were the ones that have to face the students when theyre buying the textbooks and we have very little control over the biggest component that goes into pricing the textbook

4370847 this is one of those cases that never went away for some of us
4370848 the effects are no doubt still fresh in the minds of those victims and we hope that news of this arrest will help them in their continued recovery
4370849 it feels satisfying that at least we know that the victims can have some kind of closure that they dont have to look over their shoulder to wonder if hes still out there

4370854 we have a downtown that has a lot of down time
4370855 the furniture market has sort of taken over a large part of the downtown and a lot of smaller businesses have moved out in a way thats sad but it also makes it perfect for something like this

4370869 yes youve done the same thing to me in the past
4370870 you are giving yourself permission to treat me this way because i treated you badly in the past
4370871 you know you and i were good for a long time i always thought it was because we understood each other but then i got scared about growing up and we screwed up and the we both felt bad in our own way then it was like we were part of that square peg in the round hole analogy i used to think that nevermind
4370872 im not giving myself permission to treat you poorly i guess i just was trying i dont know i guess in a way i dont feel sorry about it

4370884 bij het maken van een dergelijke reportage ben je absoluut niet bezig met dingen als prijzen winnen
4370885 natuurlijk wist ik dat de impact van de reportage groot zou zijn maar dat het een nominatie voor een emmy award op zou leveren is een zeer leuke verrassing en een blijk van erkenning
4370886 ik dacht dat ik goed begonnen was en ik zag het volop zitten
4370887 ook op de brug ging het goed maar ineens was het gedaan ik was een beetje kwaad op mezelf maar ik heb me proberen te concentreren op mijn balkoefening maar op de balk lag ik er meteen af ik ben herbegonnen en de drie volgende elementen gingen goed en dan boef viel ik weer ik dacht hoe kan dat nu ik was weer goed bezig maar ik heb toch maar doorgevochten tot het einde

4370891 they really thought it through they recognized the importance of space
4370892 he recognizes that constellation really is exploring with humans and robots beyond low earth orbit
4370893 senator obama has talked about constellation and has not specified a specific architecture
4370894 i think one of the reasons for that is that until you have the office until youre there and know whats going on with these programs youre not going to make a commitment to it

4370915 manufacturing is a vital sector of the uk economy accounting for over 50 of our exports and the uk is the worlds sixth biggest manufacturer given the uks high wage economy future productivity and global competitiveness depend upon our ability to develop high quality clever technology and products major investment in innovative research and development such as the twenty million pounds announced today will enable us to maintain and improve the quality of the uks manufacturing capability in key areas such as aerospace healthcare energy and recycling
4370916 there are some great examples of manufacturing technologies and innovation happening here in the uk these successful projects reflect the changing nature of manufacturing and we are investing in the uk to enable it to maintain its place as one of the worlds leading manufacturing locations
4370917 the grand challenge is one of a number of mod initiatives to develop new defence technologies the uk has a world class track record in scientific excellence and we want to draw on all of the expertise that is out there from box room inventors just starting out to the largest defence firms
4370918 the competition has been designed to provide an accessible and fun event for participants but there is a very serious point to it that is that the threats faced by our armed forces are continually evolving and exploiting the latest technologies will help them stay safe and ahead of the opposition
4370919 wir sind mit diesem sehr zufriedenstellenden ergebnis voll auf kurs f r das gesamtjahr gehen wir nun von einem 240 mio euro aus
4370920 we are spending more and more time with our communications devices but spending less on them our devotion to watching listening and staying in touch wherever and whenever we want shows no sign of diminishing and with healthy competition overall prices offer increasing value for money that is what consumers demand and what ofcom helps deliver
4370921 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4370922 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4370923 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4370924 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4370925 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4370926 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4370927 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4370928 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4370929 i think at its worst it allowed the policing to targets culture to take hold in the same way that we see in other public sectors at the moment teaching to targets teaching to tests so at its worst at its most extreme it encouraged that sort of policing to targets
4370930 the paperwork certainly has changed in the 12 years that ive been in the job
4370931 there seems to be more bureaucracy created and more forms that need to be filled in just as an auditable trail basically
4370932 it shows the defence whether or not there are any issues that might undermine our case

4370963 now one would not expect the world to have much time for the weakness of the psalmists cries it is very disturbing however when these cries of lamentation disappear from the language and worship of the church perhaps the western church feels no need to lament but then it is sadly deluded about how healthy it really is in terms of numbers influence and spiritual maturity perhaps and this is more likely it has drunk so deeply at the well of modern western materialism that it simply does not know what to do with such cries and regards them as little short of embarassing yet the human condition is a poor one and christians who are aware of the deceitfulness of the human heart and are looking for a better country should know this a diet of unremittingly jolly choruses and hymns inevitably creates an unrealistic horizon of expectation which sees the normative christian life as one long triumphalist street party a theologically incorrect and a pastorally disastrous scenario in a world of broken individuals has an unconscious belief that christianity is or at least should be all about health wealth and happiness corrupted the content of our worship in the psalms god has given the church a language which allows it to express even the deepest agonies of the human soul in the context of worship does our contemporary language of worship reflect the horizon of the expectation regarding the believers experience which the psalter proposes as normative if not why not is it because the comfortable values of western middle class consumerism have silently infiltrated the church and made us consider such cries irrelevant embarrassing and signs of abject failure

4370970 we do sample airworthiness bulletins when we do maintenance audits but we can only sample them
4370971 qantas would have at any time in excess of 2000 airworthiness bulletins current for its fleet
4370972 so there is no way we can audit every ad airworthiness directive they currently have
4370973 there has been too much cost cutting and not enough attention to quality

4370978 its not a new topic by any means weve been playing in the space for over 20 years our perspective is that its interesting to see other non traditional sectors taking interest in having a spatial component

4370981 theres been quite a bit of discussion at the european union eu level in recent years over the need for more open access to power and gas market information to create a more level playing field in the liberalized european markets especially for new entrants
4370982 it is hard to see a truly single european power and gas market emerging without the same kind of official recognition of the need for a common working language as in the aviation industry for example
4370983 traders need rapid access to information and in a common international language because they need to make speedy decisions

4370997 all patients enrolled in the early goal directed therapy study were appropriately selected randomized and examined statistically

4371006 a mphibians are an ancient organism which has survived past extinctions and is telling us that something is wrong right now on earth the question is whether we humans will listen before its too late
4371007 are we in the midst of the sixth mass extinction
4371008 five mass extinctions it is generally thought that there have been five great mass extinctions during the history of life on this planet in each of the five events there was a profound loss of biodiversity during a relatively short period 1 the oldest mass extinction occurred at the ordovician silurian boundary 439 million years ago approximately 25 of the families and nearly 60 of the genera of marine organisms were lost contributing factors were great fluctuations in sea level which resulted from extensive glaciations followed by a period of great global warming terrestrial vertebrates had not yet evolved 2 the next great extinction was in the late devonian 364 mya when 22 of marine families and 57 of marine genera including nearly all jawless fishes disappeared global cooling after bolide impacts may have been responsible because warm water taxa were most strongly affected amphibians the first terrestrial vertebrates evolved in the late devonian and they survived this extinction event 3 the permian triassic extinction 251 mya was by far the worst of the five mass extinctions 95 of all species marine as well as terrestrial were lost including 53 of marine families 84 of marine genera and 70 of land plants insects and vertebrates causes are debated but the leading candidate is flood volcanism emanating from the siberian traps which led to profound climate change volcanism may have been initiated by a bolide impact which led to loss of oxygen in the sea the atmosphere at that time was severely hypoxic which likely acted synergistically with other factors most terrestrial vertebrates perished but among the few that survived were early representatives of the three orders of amphibians that survive to this day 4 the end triassic extinction 199 214 mya was associated with the opening of the atlantic ocean by sea floor spreading related to massive lava floods that caused significant global warming marine organisms were most strongly affected 22 of marine families and 53 of marine genera were lost but terrestrial organisms also experienced much extinction again representatives of the three living orders of amphibians survived 5 the most recent mass extinction was at the cretaceous tertiary boundary 65 mya 16 of families 47 of genera of marine organisms and 18 of vertebrate families were lost most notable was the disappearance of nonavian dinosaurs causes continue to be debated leading candidates include diverse climatic changes e g temperature increases in deep seas resulting from volcanic floods in india deccan traps and consequences of a giant asteroid impact in the gulf of mexico not only did all three orders of amphibians again escape extinction but many if not all families and even a number of extant amphibian genera survived 6 a sixth extinction the possibility that a sixth mass extinction spasm is upon us has received much attention substantial evidence suggests that an extinction event is underway
4371009 something is wrong in our world we humans might be doing ok right now but the amphibians are doing poorly
4371010 by 2005 to 2006 the results were in and the chytrid fungus has had a profound impact on populations of amphibians particularly in central america and the mountains of california and in the tropical mountains of australia how does the chytrid fungus kill chytrid fungus infection shows in the pink underbelly of green tree frog right great barred frog has a severe chytrid fungus infection that is causing its skin to peel off images by australia national parks and wildlife service we dont know exactly thats the question i always ask in scientific meetings what is the immediate cause of death there are hypotheses the chytrid fungus is a rather simple organism genetically complex but simple in structure that invades the superficial surface of the skin of amphibians the chytrid fungus lives on keratin when we feel our skin thats what we are feeling keratins are the main constituent of structures that grow from the skin keratin is the outermost surface so the chytrid fungus eats this keratin stuff that was not considered nutritious for organisms but the chytrid fungus favors keratin chytrid fungus cells about to release more spores below electron micrograph of chytrid fungus on frog skin photomicrographs by lee berger australias commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro when an amphibian gets a massive infection of the chytrid fungus it probably interferes with the amphibians respiration because even those creatures with excellent lungs actually have most of the gaseous exchange across their moist skins so they suffocate in their own skin i cant prove that but its a general consensus of researchers because amphibians breathe through their skin they do they get 90 or in some cases 100 of their respiration through their skin there are many frogs and salamanders that are even lungless so the lungs are not necessary at all for amphibian respiration amphibians depend upon their highly vascularized moist skins for respiration and causes havoc
4371011 i remember this well when clawed frogs were the main organisms used for human pregnancy tests
4371012 if youre going to make such a dramatic change in methodology its really a different report and should have come out as a different report
4371013 maine government is still collecting the same amount of taxes under the old report as under the new report
4371014 in terms of marketing to the outside world to those businesses that are looking to maine its very positive
4371015 but for those people who have urged us to lower our tax burden we need to continue the momentum
4371016 i spent 25 years of my life trying to give people the best information available its so frustrating because i feel like ive inadvertently misled or put extra heat on where it was not deserved
4371017 we have been getting backlash from the people of maine for a number of years in the form of citizen referendums suggesting that tax burden is an issue would it have been different if the tax foundation gave us a different ranking i dont know
4371018 it added fuel to the fire but did it start the fire i really cant say
4371019 right now people are more concerned about the economy in general and taxes are more of bullet point
4371020 i am very disappointed at what has happened but i would do the same again
4371021 its unthinkable why someone would take someones car when they are just trying to help a man who has been seriously hurt

4371040 i have had two conversations with mateev insisting that he file his resignation because of violations of the code of ethics adopted by the cabinet for top officials in the executive unfortunately at the moment he is presenting the reasons for his resignation in a different light by citing the conclusions of the commission in the work of sveti ivan rilski hospital as the justification these conclusions have nothing in common with the real reasons for his resignation

4371046 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4371047 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4371048 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry

4371055 i do not want to comment on that how long he will be on leave or when he is due back
4371056 bulgaria is a nato and an eu member state and we think that we are responsible from this point of view because we have been one of the most active states in the drawing up of the eus black sea synergy policy i think that we have to be extremely active and constructive in the development of the current conflict because we are in a unique position
4371057 namely this combination i would say makes us a very important participant in the common european efforts to find a political solution
4371058 you cant drink all night with mutri a term commonly used in bulgaria in relation to underworld criminals and pretend to be working for the ministry you cant be at a crime scene and leave it soon after without taking the measures that you otherwise expect from any ordinary policeman

4371068 our plan foresees the first store being opened at the beginning of 2010 with an area of more than 25 000 sq m
4371069 its not a surprise that the price is lower than the one they would receive from a different investor but everywhere in the world ikea stores are retail destinations and the first such in bulgaria will make any project in the vicinity successful
4371070 we put our faith in the bulgarian consumer at the moment personal income in the country is not high but it can only increase from here for this reason the prices that we will set will be lower than those in our greek stores
4371071 the general catalogue will be the same as for greece and will gradually be enlarged
4371072 the targeted revenues in our five year business plan are based on a conservative estimate because the bulgarian market is just now starting to take off but we reckon that ikea products will be met with great success in bulgaria
4371073 our idea is to have two or three in bulgaria the second will be on the bulgarian black sea between bourgas and varna and about the third were not yet sure

4371079 follow me and i will make you fishers of men
4371080 you never see any trash in scotland and the whole time we were there we only saw five policemen on bicycles

4371083 anyone is able to say whatever they want i know that i am clean i did project believe with usada us anti doping agency where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove that
4371084 people can question all they want but the facts are facts and i have the results to prove it
4371085 with a program like i have i have to work on speed and endurance and all four strokes i need the speed to take it out at the start and the endurance to carry it through

4371091 protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics
4371092 it would be absolutely ridiculous to try and put in place an inquiry between now and the election
4371093 troy buswell is trying to whip up a political issue
4371094 i read headlines about growing calls for an inquiry the only thing growing is troys hysteria about it
4371095 the issue about independence aside imagine troy could easily say to me set up a royal commission i set up a royal commission and he says hang on youve appointed it
4371096 i have absolutely no problem at some point or another if its required having a bigger inquiry
4371097 a member of the lloyds register group was engaged in 2006 to conduct a limited verification of apaches operations
4371098 lloyds register has not contributed to any physical inspection or maintenance related services to the pipeline or facility in question
4371099 it is a symbol of the importance of the russian language and of cyrillic
4371100 despite the fact that most mac users have to use pcs at work
4371101 i thought if i flopped something here my ace might be the best hand and i could make a big pot
4371102 maybe he thinks i have a draw maybe he thinks i have 3 5 and im looking for a deuce or maybe he thinks i have two big overcards
4371103 im thinking he could have a full house so i was going to play the hand cautiously
4371104 or maybe he was on a stone cold bluff figuring i didnt have a 6 or maybe i have two overcards
4371105 i was pretty sure i had the best hand but i wasnt going to make it into a big pot and risk getting check raised
4371106 i was just going to let him fire into the pot
4371107 when he checked the river i checked behind him because i didnt want to get check raised i didnt have the nuts if i bet he could check raise in that spot and id have to fold because so many hands had gotten there on the river
4371108 theres really not any equity in playing big pots unless youve flopped the joint and youre the one making it big

4371112 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling

4371123 we conclude that fuel consumption and ghg emissions of our light duty vehicle fleet can be reduced significantly

4371126 its different being here on the base but its good to be at home
4371127 its good being able to come back and show the hometown people what i can do
4371128 hes a terrific kid and has such a great work ethic
4371129 he has been through so much and has handled the tragedy so well
4371130 he has such a charisma around him that everybody loves hes a popular guy who people still follow around here
4371131 how he responds to tough situations is a testament to what his parents instilled in him and the values he has
4371132 i want to push the guys ahead of me and see if i can get some playing time
4371133 i want to see how many reps i can get
4371134 because these guys are my team and i want to give back in a little way what they give me
4371135 i was yelling so loudly in the building i was living in other people thought something was wrong
4371136 i really like the setup here and the way weve been treated the atmosphere is pretty neat
4371137 we wanted to try it see how we liked it this is great well see where it takes us from here hopefully theyll want us back
4371138 no doubt if they want to come wed love to host it
4371139 any time we can host an event that the community gets excited about thats a good day for us
4371140 it is always good for them to be a part of the military community coming out to support the troops fraser said
4371141 it is not only good for the troops but for the high school and the community
4371142 sierra vista is a small community and any time you bring in an outside event such as this it boosts morale
4371143 thats crazy to know that when theyre all the way over there theyre watching us play football and caring about us
4371144 just the fact that they take time out of their lives when theyre going through a war thats insane
4371145 i made it a point to tell my boss last week that i was not going to go to work for a couple of hours thursday and friday in the morning our busiest time
4371146 but they know how big a fan i am they said yeah and im here
4371147 i had a gut feeling about it he made me look good
4371148 adam should have been here a while ago calling homers
4371149 ive been going through a stretch where i was scuffling
4371150 thats just part of a long season making 33 34 starts not all of them are going to go great i worked on a few things in the bullpen got myself right and just felt a lot better out there
4371151 hes a big part of this team he can play any position and were going to need him down the stretch
4371152 my first year i ate a moth my second year i ate a squito my third year i ate a what did i eat my third year
4371153 my third year i dont even remember what i ate but i was planning on eating a beetle this year but we didnt go up there
4371154 it was a lot of fun and i felt very good
4371155 it was good and very competitive said olson who was joined by ua associate head coach mike dunlap in greece
4371156 we had the opportunity to see some of the top european kids
4371157 it was good to be out and good for the kids to see me said olson noted for being a dogged recruiter
4371158 it also gave me a chance to see the other coaches that i hadnt seen during the year
4371159 i am very happy with how things have gone were on the top kids
4371160 one and done recruits after brandon jennings opted to head to europe instead of coming to ua
4371161 i just think for the continuity of the program its important we try to avoid one and dones olson said
4371162 that doesnt mean were not going to take a guy who looks like hes going to stay two years
4371163 nowadays for some of the top recruits its not very likely theyll stay more than two years he said
4371164 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4371165 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for the 100
4371166 i probably hit 18 greens and i dont remember chipping so that was good too
4371167 it was a great day it always feels good when you have no bogeys on your scorecard youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4371168 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased
4371169 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes
4371170 i think my game has always been there its more emotionally sometimes you have ups and downs and distractions and youre tired
4371171 ive played solid the last couple of weeks ive had my rest and my time to practice and get motivated i dont want to get too far ahead this is just one round hopefully it will continue to go in this direction
4371172 watching from afar with lebron he handles the ball a lot
4371173 i think that i can take a load off of him handling the ball at times hes a guy that kind of sets his teammates up a lot i think i can relieve him from that that will help him as far as being a little fresher at the end of the season
4371174 mos quickness with the basketball is something we havent had since i got here
4371175 we need to continue to get better we know that if that means some personnel changes need to happen then so be it
4371176 my actions are going to speak louder than my words
4371177 i know what it takes to win and its no secret it takes defense to win
4371178 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
4371179 going out on the balcony with a pint of blueberries to thumb through books i borrowed from the library
4371180 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4371181 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4371182 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4371183 the one thing i want to make sure we do is make sure kurt gets some time with the first team
4371184 es gibt meiner ansicht nach keinen grund die lage zu dramatisieren
4371185 das mag f r einige regionen in der welt zutreffen aber nicht f r den euroraum als ganzes
4371186 was wir jetzt sehen sind die indirekten auswirkungen fr herer preissteigerungen bei l und anderen rohstoffen
4371187 es passiert und es besteht das risiko dass es sich weiter ausbreitet
4371188 wir sahen auf keinem unserer m rkte eine abschw chung und der august l uft noch besser
4371189 vielleicht wird es kein zweistelliges prozentuales wachstum aber auf jeden fall ein vorzeigbares plus
4371190 we are out here trying to win games these guys are trying to win wars
4371191 they risk their lives every single day it is not a comparison we run and get tired these guys get up at 5 in the morning run and get trained
4371192 they are on call not knowing where they could go overseas there is no comparison
4371193 seeing them picks us up and makes us work harder because we know what they do every day in their training
4371194 its nice coming out here and watching them practice its great
4371195 its good training you always have to give 100 percent and you have to be able to count on the people around you that is the same with us you have to be able to count on the people you are with as people and soldiers
4371196 people come out here and are lethargic and it cant be that way
4371197 it tends to happen every now and then sometimes it takes somebody jumping down your throat to get it going
4371198 i hope so if the message wasnt received i dont know what needed to be done
4371199 maybe we need to get one of the drill sergeants out here
4371200 it is the first time i have slept in a dorm in quite some time it was good
4371201 we had a good time the kids were right there with them
4371202 i was not hanging out in the lounge with them wednesday night we went in town and had a pepsi and came back it is kind of neat
4371203 they tell me the surgery went well but thats all i know right now
4371204 we did an mri and there is no acl anterior cruciate ligament problems he has a few things he needs cleaned out in his knee
4371205 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4371206 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4371207 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4371208 being at the last all star game at the old place was such a thrill and to link the two together is going to be pretty neat
4371209 obviously it is going to be a very special day
4371210 theres so much history with the yankees and with the new stadium i am sure a lot of people who have meant a lot to this game will be there that day
4371211 for me it wont be the anxiety of oh my god we have to make this race its a big deal for at least one week
4371212 but were only in the top 35 by eight points and i dont want to say were good
4371213 all it takes is one little mistake mechanical or driver error and were right back out
4371214 i feel badly for the athletes who wont get to use my shots but after tibet i know im right
4371215 threw him to the ground and attacked him with electric batons
4371216 i knew all along that for us to spurt we needed to play better on the road
4371217 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4371218 itll be fun for our current team to play against the pros olson said
4371219 its going to be a lot of fun to go up against guys like channing frye said withey a 6 foot 10 215 pound center
4371220 theyre probably tired after coming in from a bunch of summer camps he said
4371221 but this is one of the best camps out there you get to know the coaches and the surroundings around the program this is really good and its fun
4371222 theyre the ones with the guns i cant really argue
4371223 but if they want to come out one afternoon and get something together well have a little fun with them
4371224 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4371225 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4371226 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away

4371231 at this rate the arctic ocean could be nearly ice free at the end of summer by 2012 much faster than previous predictions
4371232 the arctic is often cited as the canary in the coal mine for climate warming
4371233 now as a sign of climate warming the canary has died it is time to start getting out of the coal mines
4371234 now i look at 2008 will it be even warmer than the past year
4371235 what if we injected a huge cloud of ash into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight and heat as an emergency measure to slow a melting ice cap
4371236 this is telling us that despite the ongoing warming in the arctic today maybe we dont have to be so worried about the polar bear
4371237 yes global warming is occuring but maybe its not quite as bad as we think it is
4371238 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it
4371239 im just saying that as a band were praying that they will reach their full musical potential in christ

4371243 xcor built a small two seated vehicle powered by kerosene and liquid oxygen which burns cleanly at about 6 000 f and emits no smoke or particulate matter
4371244 xcor has also helped design a methane fueled engine its an even greener technology because unlike the petroleum based kerosene methane is a renewable energy source theoretically we could get the methane from anywhere even from cow manure graham says
4371245 the virgin system uses less fuel because the rocket engine has to fire for only 90 seconds to reach thinner atmosphere attenborough says virgin calculated that each of the rockets six passengers will have a carbon footprint totaling 0 8 metric tons of carbon dioxide in comparison a passenger on a 747 jet from new york to london is responsible for two metric tons

4371255 there were only very few artists of that caliber then
4371256 there are collectors who keep these works of art in bank vaults but it is likely that well find others

4371258 thirty two years ago it was ok so now were going backwards

4371264 its about me doing my job and do what coach wants me to do
4371265 thats get in and play very aggressive defensively be very active and be a leader and offensively attack and not only make plays for myself but make plays for others
4371266 i think ive been put in a position to do that with having guys giving me the ball in the right spots im playing with a lot of confidence
4371267 we have seen the reports in western media for lenovo as an olympic sponsor this will not have any effect on us

4371271 she deserves it and i won the silver which is the best feeling ever
4371272 i knew i just had to go out there and do a normal routine
4371273 my dad kept saying dont do anything better than you know how to do dont do anything worse just try to do it normal thats really what i was concentrating on
4371274 i think this makes it a little sweeter just knowing ive been through pretty big injuries and some doubters
4371275 honestly it just made me feel much stronger and it made me the person i am today its definitely been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it

4371279 i just had to forget about the 200 back and focus for the 2 im
4371280 tomorrow mornings race is probably the most important race i think coach bob bowman and i talked about it what we want to do is get out with a fast first 50 and try to set up a good race for me being a body length behind after the first 50 like i was yesterday isnt where i want to be
4371281 ryan swam a wonderful race and i swam the best possible race i could apparently it takes a world record just to win it
4371282 i just tried to stay relaxed and not rush through the water keep my stroke going and power to the end
4371283 both hate to lose and dont back away from anybody or anything
4371284 i was chasing someone named don schollander and jesse owens who had four gold medals and when i came up with a program for seven gold medals it came to be almost ridiculously invented by myself
4371285 it is quite difficult to imagine that one of his competitors is going to think that on any given day that it is going to be his day
4371286 not only do you do your best time and break his old world record you are still looking at his feet i think that is a little demoralizing
4371287 that is very difficult to stay focused for eight days
4371288 it gets a little easier because for me every race that i won was an event that i never had to swim again for the rest of my life i really felt like they were taking bricks off my back and the load was getting easier i think michael thinks the same thing
4371289 then in 72 he was obviously a more mature man
4371290 michael has been magnificent since his first olympics as the youngest guy on the team
4371291 the long tail how the niche is revolutionizing politics best practices for political advertising online and how web video changes the political conversation
4371292 experience is the greatest tool in this league at the quarterback position
4371293 every year that goes by i feel like you learn something that can be incorporated into your game
4371294 it gives us a good measuring stick to see where we are at and exactly how far we need to go
4371295 theyre judged on wins but yeah i think tony he stepped into a team had a better supporting cast at the time
4371296 if you get the right guys around cutler the guy can step out and have a breakout year if this team is going to go to the next level its going to be because of jay
4371297 i know some of our players are excited about wearing the orange jersey
4371298 we think the fans will be excited to see it a couple times as well
4371299 well be discussing play sequences what coverage theyre in what are we getting with personnel id like to think its a team effort its a great offensive staff that really works hard putting the plan together its very hard to put a whole plan together without divvying up to all the coaches
4371300 i prefer to be down in the middle of it
4371301 our inside scheme i think is a lot better than what we had last year
4371302 he just pushed on me and i let it ride like i always do and he pushed again and it was over i went after him
4371303 we knew when we were able to bring back our football program and the other two programs that it would create some excitement
4371304 but its gone beyond my expectations as far as how excited people are about whats going on up here
4371305 one of the things were trying to do at the university is increase student life and campus life and obviously a football program and a football stadium on campus will add to that
4371306 they are so excited right now because i havent screwed it up too badly
4371307 im still undefeated so everybody thinks im a good coach and everybody likes me
4371308 its been the biggest learning curve of my life but its exactly what i needed i needed to get out of my comfort zone
4371309 its going to take us awhile to get where we want to go even on our first level of winning this conference
4371310 its going to take awhile to do that once we do that then well set our sights on bigger things
4371311 when i was the athletic director at the university we started baseball
4371312 and everyone said take your lumps and be ready for that we didnt have that attitude the first year we hosted the regionals which has never been done since and never been done before
4371313 so first year is no excuse you dont have any baggage you start from scratch and we expect to be competitive
4371314 once we hand the keys over to the stadium we are not going to be meddling boosters looking over everyones shoulder
4371315 this was truly a gift of our hearts and its for the benefit of the university and the community of pueblo
4371316 its a good organization and if they can use him thats great
4371317 the only thing i can truly say is im happy he signed with someone
4371318 i always got along with john i think he did great things for this organization
4371319 i might have a few things up my sleeves for him
4371320 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4371321 i didnt do them to influence the commissioner i did them to better myself as a person
4371322 they were normally things that i have been doing besides staying out of trouble thats what im trying to do
4371323 will dwyane come back to the form that he was
4371324 now that im here and i met the staff and players and everything im excited
4371325 i was told that this surgery was probably going to end my career and im better than ever ive been waiting patiently i just want my shot and today it looks like im going to get it
4371326 the last time i played three in the back was with d c united and i won a championship
4371327 its not only frustrating for the starters but for the guys on the bench thinking maybe we could add something but i guess you never know
4371328 i missed a couple of key opportunities to score and ill never get them back ill never get them back
4371329 and this isnt the place where you should be walking around saying anything like that in a competition like this youre looking to see your soul gasping for air out on the mat and that didnt happen today
4371330 when i walked off the mat i wasnt tired and if thats the case then i didnt do everything that i should have
4371331 i think im known as a defensive coordinator but ive got a pretty good record as a head coach and i think it will get better
4371332 the application for leave will be filed shortly woolworths said
4371333 it is not appropriate to comment further at this stage
4371334 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
4371335 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life
4371336 my comment to him was if dara can do it we can do it
4371337 im not going to win any medals for what i am doing
4371338 i never had any previous problems but this is football right
4371339 my leg just stuck and i think momentum took me one way and i felt the pop
4371340 there are a lot worse things that could have happened as far as timing i think this is probably the best if i was a junior id be really frustrated this gives me an opportunity to develop as far as mentally and physically
4371341 wed have to stop running because thats basically when theyve happened
4371342 youre always looking for two to stand out but it may not be that way at first
4371343 this may be an issue that doesnt get solved until the early part of the season
4371344 hes got wingspan hes got speed hes got nice soft hands he can catch the ball and the bonus is for a freshman he will tackle
4371345 if things dont go well i may have to redshirt
4371346 when you try to run the 1s the 2s the 3s in a scrimmage its hard to get a sense of rhythm
4371347 i think weve going to run the football but new offensive coordinator bob cole has always had success throwing the ball i anticipate well be better than we were last night throwing the football
4371348 if we were to begin today shea would be the initial guy to play that spot for us
4371349 clearly the future direction of interest rates and employment levels will impact on the environment in which the company will be operating in fiscal 2009 it said
4371350 in these circumstances it is not possible at this time to accurately forecast results for the 2009 year
4371351 big ticket trader nick scali is more exposed than other retailers to interest rate rises and any slowdown in home building activity
4371352 the march interest rate rise appears to have had the most significant impact on consumer spending patterns that the company has seen for many years the retailer said at the time
4371353 tight retail environment in which the combination of record fuel prices and higher interest rates are influencing consumer sentiment
4371354 obama will work tirelessly to uphold this nations sacred trust with its veterans to ensure they are not forgotten after they return home and he will provide our troops with the leadership they deserve as well as the support they and their families need
4371355 we feel confident that many u s troops stationed overseas will support john mccain in the election this fall but we suspect most are too busy doing the important work of defending this country than to make political contributions
4371356 i think sen gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador to belarus although im not sure the citizens of minsk would welcome that
4371357 while we believe that potential accc issues can be resolved they may come at a price to bg and possibly to qgc if bg has to exit its 20 per cent stake in qgcs tenements credit suisse said in a client note
4371358 all this spells delay or an adverse finding by the accc with bg forced to go back to the accc with its solution which we do not believe is the best outcome for bg
4371359 were personally devastated about it but its been done so now weve got to follow the next steps
4371360 we have to get a full inquiry because not only myself but there are a number of people really upset about this veterinary clinic
4371361 the iocs public expression of concern is welcome but it wont have any effect without real action
4371362 the international olympic committees failure to address this problem highlights the urgent need for mechanisms to prevent further abuses
4371363 oh they did an amazing job they worked on him for over two hours they did a huge job working as a team to try to bring hime back around
4371364 a thorough assessment process would need to be undertaken before considering a full scale bid
4371365 lodging an expression of interest however keeps aru in the ball park while assessing what would clearly be a daunting financial challenge
4371366 he turned the full force of his blue flamed gaze upon her and caressed her pretty lips with his finger pulling her towards him to devour her pink lushness with his beard smudged mouth
4371367 we see the international market as probably becoming the biggest element of our business
4371368 while australian industrial shares will benefit from the shift towards lower interest rates and the sharp fall in the australian dollar resources shares are likely to remain under pressure over the next few months and this will likely result in the australian share market underperforming global shares for a few months
4371369 asian shares should be key beneficiaries of lower commodity prices though
4371370 while only 31 major companies having reported so far the proportion of results in line with expectations is running at 53 per cent which is well above that in previous reporting seasons and the proportion coming in above expectations is just 20 per cent which is well down
4371371 the barcode system was invented because out of our 550 children we had on average about 180 arriving late every day
4371372 now we have on average nine late kids per day
4371373 where previously children used to slink into the back of the classroom and try and pretend they had been there now they must present the piece of paper to their classroom teacher
4371374 you cant teach children who arent at school so the upside to this is the kids are actually at school
4371375 i just thought it has to be a simple easy way to track every child when they come in and something they all could do themselves
4371376 thanks for making twitter 90 per cent less useful to a lot of australian twitter users
4371377 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to 10 followers you arent charged 10 times thats because weve been footing the bill
4371378 when we launched our free sms service to the world we set the clock ticking as the service grew in popularity so too would the price
4371379 even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about us 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us
4371380 it makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users
4371381 bob wants answers about what has been going on max is keen to meet him and explain he only has his daughters future at heart but he has a tough job on his hands
4371382 peaches is expecting fireworks although she knows her dad will respect her wishes
4371383 bob cant get over the fact she did this on a whim
4371384 right now he doesnt want to see her but hes incandescent with rage and she is in for a huge talking to when they finally meet up
4371385 peaches was ashamed of the overdose and worried shed end up like amy winehouse she and faris had started regularly using drugs and she realised it was becoming a problem
4371386 so when she met max again who is a nice boy and a harvard graduate she thought being alongside him would steer her life on a different path he was the nicest boy she could find quickly enough and was the key to her escaping the drugs
4371387 i imagine there are some great people in there and some good infrastructure that might be useful but i suspect this will take a while to pan out
4371388 that business has been a mix of companies over the years with volante ipex and commander and people on the outside dont know what shape its in until the receivers put out their memorandum
4371389 weve put in an expression of interest but dont know what that will mean yet
4371390 the way the receivers handle it is very time sensitive the value could erode quickly as people and clients look elsewhere
4371391 there may be some good people left but even if you picked up parts of the it business the problem is they wouldnt be very profitable you would have to re educate those customers to pay more and could you be sure youd be able to convert them
4371392 we have picked up a few good commander contracts before they went broke we told these customers we would like to work with them but couldnt do it at the margins they had been used to with commander without going out of business the good thing is we were able to retain most of them
4371393 id say the biggest asset is commanders franchise business and the second thing is the managed services both of which are not in our field
4371394 customers build up respect for the people they deal with if these people move to organisations that can service them well weve often seen customers follow them
4371395 i think the network is very strong and there were a number of customers
4371396 it should be a telstra optus or someone who wants to take a substantial hold in that space i also think the key telephony maintenance business is valuable and a lot of key smb customers who have been loyal to commander over the years
4371397 made his bed now hed fucking well better lay in it

4371403 he defended the cause of the poor and needy and so all went well
4371404 stiller shows an incredible ability to manage a highly complex project which mirrors many big budget dramas in terms of complexity but it pieces it all together in such a way you sometimes can forget you are watching a comedy
4371405 as i said downey jr is the hook for this film but the real shame lies in the fact that the best of what you see of him has already played in the films trailer and promo ads
4371406 it doesnt just present jokes on the screen and then wait for you to laugh it shoves comedy dynamite up your nose and then giggles while it lights the fuse
4371407 as a director stillers crafted a big shiny comedy and the scale is for the most part matched by the laughs
4371408 one of the funniest movies of the summer if you get the jokes
4371409 je ne voulais pas partir sur quelque chose de mauvais jai essay

4371416 i indicated to the organisers of indy last year that i thought we could be doing better in relation to managing some of the more lewd behaviour
4371417 i dont think anyone wants to see the fun taken out of indy but i dont think most people want to see it cross the line into obscenity either
4371418 you can have a lot of fun without turning off international visitors and spectators
4371419 if the police can identify you they can make a charge

4371463 god does not work salvation for fictitious sinners be a sinner and sin vigorously do not for a moment imagine that this life is the abiding place of justice sin must be committed
4371464 sin cannot tear you away from him christ even though you commit adultery a hundred times a day and commit as many murders
4371465 a large number of deaf crippled and blind people are afflicted solely through the malice of the demon and one must in no wise doubt that plagues fevers and every sort of evil come from him
4371466 an earthly kingdom cannot exist without inequality of persons some must be free some serfs some rulers some subjects
4371467 as for the demented i hold it certain that all beings deprived of reason are thus afflicted only by the devil
4371468 as to the common people one has to be hard with them and see that they do their work and that under the threat of the sword and the law they comply with the observance of piety just as you chain up wild beasts

4371477 idiots the lame the blind the dumb are men in whom the devils have established themselves and all the physicians who heal these infirmities as though they proceeded from natural causes are ignorant blockheads
4371478 in many countries there are particular places to which devils more especially resort in prussia there is an infinite number of evil spirits
4371479 in switzerland on a high mountain not far from lucerne there is a lake they call pilates pond which the devil has fixed upon as one of the chief residences of his evil spirits
4371480 many demons are in woods in waters in wildernesses and in dark poolly places ready to hurt people
4371481 many sweat to reconcile st paul and st james but in vain faith justifies and faith does not justify contradict each other flatly if any one can harmonize them i will give him my doctors hood and let him call me a fool
4371482 no gown worse becomes a than the desire to be wise
4371483 our bodies are always exposed to satan the maladies i suffer are not natural but devils spells
4371484 reason is the greatest enemy that faith has it never comes to the aid of spiritual things but more frequently than not struggles against the divine word
4371485 reason must be deluded blinded and destroyed faith must trample underfoot all reason sense and understanding and whatever it sees must be put out of sight and know nothing but the word of god
4371486 snakes and monkeys are subjected to the demon more than other animals satan lives in them and possesses them he uses them to deceive men and to injure them
4371487 some demons are also in the thick black clouds which cause hail lightning and thunder and poison the air the pastures and grounds
4371488 the best way to get rid of the devil if you cannot kill it with the words of holy scripture is to rail at and mock him
4371489 the devil can so completely assume the human form when he wants to deceive us that we may well lie with what seems to be a woman of real flesh and blood and yet all the while tis only the devil in the shape of a woman tis the same with women who may think that a man is in bed with them yet tis only the devil and the result of this connection is oftentimes an imp of darkness half mortal half devil
4371490 the devil clutched hold of the miserable young man and flew off with him through the ceiling since which time nothing has been heard of him
4371491 the devil fears the word of god he cant bite it it breaks his teeth
4371492 the devil it is true is not exactly a doctor who has taken degrees but he is very learned very expert for all that he has not been carrying on his business during thousands of years for nothing
4371493 the devil too sometimes steals human children it is not infrequent for him to carry away infants within the first six weeks after birth and to substitute in their place imps
4371494 the fact that the biblical book hebrews is not an epistle of st paul or of any other apostle is proved by what it says in chapter two
4371495 the winds are nothing else but good or bad spirits hark how the devil is puffing and blowing
4371496 there is no rustic so rude but that if he dreams or fancies anything it must be the whisper of the holy ghost and he himself a prophet
4371497 this fool copernicus wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy but sacred scripture tells us that joshua commanded the sun to stand still and not the earth
4371498 to be a christian you must pluck out the eye of reason
4371499 two devils rose from the water and flew off through the air crying oh oh oh and turning one over another in sportive mockery
4371500 we are at fault for not slaying them the jews
4371501 we know on the authority of moses that longer than six thousand years the world did not exist
4371502 we may well lie with what seems to be a woman of flesh and blood and yet all the time it is only a devil in the shape of a woman
4371503 we need not invite the devil to our table he is too ready to come without being asked the air all about us is filled with demons
4371504 we should throw the epistle of james out of this school the university of wittenberg
4371505 what shall we do with the jews i advise that all their prayer books and talmudic writings are to be taken from them
4371506 what shall we do with the jews i advise that safe conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the jews
4371507 what shall we do with the jews i advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach on pain of loss of life and limb
4371508 what shall we do with the jews set fire to their synagogues or schools and bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them
4371509 what shall we do with the jews their homes also should be razed and destroyed
4371510 when i was a child there were many witches and they bewitched both cattle and men especially children
4371511 whoever wants to be a christian should tear the eyes out of his reason
4371512 women have but small and narrow chests and broad hips to the end that they should remain at home sit still keep house and bear and bring up children
4371513 so tenaciously should we cling to the world revealed by the gospel that were i to see all the angels of heaven coming down to me to tell me something different not only would i not be tempted to doubt a single syllable but i would shut my eyes and stop my ears for they would not deserve to be either seen or heard
4371514 you really need to separate people who attack the jesuits or popes from people who hate catholics the two sentiments are not in any way the same thing and you make yourself look silly by claiming that they are
4371515 yes but martin luther was generally a reasonable and good person
4371516 the alumbrados i e the spanish illuminati came especially from among the reformed franciscans and jesuits and st ignatius loyola the founder of the jesuit order was charged in 1527 with sympathizing with them
4371517 its a wireless camera and monitor the monitor is a small 2 and a half inch monitor that goes on your dashboard and a small camera that hooks near your license plate frame so installation is really very simple it is wireless so its going to transmit the signal from what is seen in the camera to that monitor in the front and its going to do that every time you shift into reverse and of course one of the key ones is it hits a retail price point of 129 dollars which makes it affordable for man many people its within the skill sets of many people to install it
4371518 i just dont understand the logic in these valuations i have a business degree and i just dont get it
4371519 looking at all the reports in the national media theyre expecting a reduction and theyre getting an increase
4371520 thats the most prevalent thing were hearing its certainly understandable
4371521 that is pretty much what we do all the time we play catch up
4371522 theyre walking a thin line im walking a thin line my taxes will go up from 11 000 to 17 000 by my calculation thats about 430 a month my wages arent going up that much
4371523 our responsibility is to value the property at market what we believe is what you could sell the property for in january using the best information we have available
4371524 part of the value of the appeal process is it gives us an opportunity to take another look at the property
4371525 we used to consider ourselves gavel to gavel that doesnt make sense any more for lots of reasons were not c span they perform a public service but we provide more than that
4371526 looking ahead to the conventions we had finally hit on the formula that integrated msnbc and nbc news the guy we were going to lean on was tim russert i think wed be best advised to take that time we were going to give to tim and just be silent in his memory i dont know what were going to do without him i mean that in the philosophical way but also practically speaking
4371527 we used to consider ourselves gavel to gavel that doesnt make sense any more for lots of reasons were not cspan they perform a public service but we provide more than that
4371528 the convention is a huge reason why larimer square wanted to complete the package for the tourists coming in
4371529 they want to offer them an option for a nightclub
4371530 thats our focus the clubs in denver have been unable to deliver such a product in comparison to l a and in comparison to las vegas
4371531 we offer a special experience that people expect throughout the process from the time they get approached by our vip hostesses to the follow up approach that we have
4371532 you cant open it in a mall in aurora or lakewood
4371533 its a different price range in terms of the bottle service
4371534 the products were going to be offering here we have additional things that will justify why its more expensive fresh juices instead of pop being in big pitchers it will be in individual bottles well be offering assorted chocolates and strawberries
4371535 and with that theres a huge need for a responsible upscale sophisticated night life concept that doesnt end at 10 or 11
4371536 thats how i get inspired traveling around and seeing how things are
4371537 i feel that people are ready for that right now
4371538 id like to think based on the quality of work that we are in that league but that being said i do feel that in order to take that next step we need to do something like this
4371539 my gallery was formed as a destination gallery and the whole way it functions is as a destination gallery
4371540 once you pull that into a more commercial zone your whole business model changes a little bit or maybe dramatically
4371541 i thought the series seemed too soft and agreeable for its own good without any social bite or political consciousness
4371542 color by fox the fox network and the revolution in black television
4371543 somehow we always end up with very stereotypical mammy kind of programs sassy female characters life in the hood kind of programming
4371544 it was almost like signifying to the viewer theres a place for you in this
4371545 by making these characters interact and get along and be girlfriends together
4371546 i think for everybody it signaled the end of the madness
4371547 there were a tremendous amount of things to worry about from prolonged exposure to mud to the leptospirosis virus caused by every animal in creation a lot of people were getting sick
4371548 a couple of people got bit by centipedes its like getting shot by a gun apparently you have to go to the hospital
4371549 but i put myself out there ive had flops there is stuff i do that could easily become parody too again it always comes back to what we are satirizing the actors and the hollywood system what do you do to be taken seriously how far do you go
4371550 buyers see and hear stories about the collapse of the national housing market everywhere and that makes them afraid to move forward with a purchase
4371551 much of the savings in prices was consumed by higher interest rates leaving buyers frustrated that they are not benefiting from price declines as they expected
4371552 the relationship between sex and creativity is obvious but theres always been something taboo about it in our culture like it should be kept in a room
4371553 and yet sex is what we do to perpetuate the species its the most natural and creative thing in the world
4371554 sometimes the biggest leap forward is the one you take back home
4371555 seemingly more than one half of the population of the western world have experienced some form of compulsive hoarding be it themselves or someone close to them
4371556 more of an exhibition than an attempt to seek remedy for the compulsion and did i mention its funny because it really is funny
4371557 im retired from politics so when i attend i dont get stirred up i dont get the buzz i dont feel quite the excitement i used to i pay close attention and see a lot of old friends i find it quite exhausting whereas years ago i would have fed on it
4371558 its not nostalgia its a bit disorienting i may not even stay the whole week id like to see sen barack obama give his speech on television
4371559 ive always felt that a young man worth his salt is a democrat until he makes a little money and if he wants to save that money he becomes a republican
4371560 after youve been playing and touring long enough you start looking for ways that allow you to relax and work at the same time
4371561 its great to be somewhere like this because this is the kind of place where you can work on your own stuff too
4371562 all the girls here are stars you are the northern lights
4371563 if this was the cold war we could keep each other warm
4371564 i played the guy a song and he said theres too much going on in your song
4371565 its a birthing process and as that song is coming out it takes me over until its out
4371566 sometimes ill be doing the dishes and things form in my brain and ill jot them down
4371567 i have to be moving like today i couldnt just sit there so i walked into town and when i got back i had a verse and a chorus
4371568 youre either born with the compulsion to write or youre not
4371569 getting up in the morning and writing is what you do and its the least glamorous part of it and the most gratifying part of it
4371570 i feel like i have to write or else i cant enjoy my day
4371571 normally i do very introverted work but this time i wanted to do something very open where the dancers are looking to the audience
4371572 i wanted something soft a bit funny and beautiful to watch
4371573 there are a lot of new organic gestures in the choreography not like a note for note music composition
4371574 choreographically its much better because i can polish the end product better its more a mixture of past styles because all three dancers are trained in classical ballet but i tried to go deeper into exploring movement with using every body part and gesture when its very still sometimes they just move their fingers
4371575 whats great is that when i see the list from ticket sales i see people coming from all over the states
4371576 im sure it makes an impact too that this is the one show we do in boulder this year
4371577 its either april or october were just waiting to see whats available
4371578 oh god that sounds boring doesnt it what i mean is that its a very friendly piece and should bring people together
4371579 you were our pride and joy until that oriental kid asked to wok our dog
4371580 its nearly finished now we are just waiting for a safety inspection
4371581 we have reported it to the police and they are looking into the matter
4371582 the playground is virtually finished but we are waiting for the rospa safety inspection before we can install the swings and therefore cannot give a firm date for completion at this time
4371583 de har sj lva sv rt att se att de har beg tt n got brott
4371584 i was stupid but i didnt intend to drive it any further and regret having moved it
4371585 los l deres rusos montan este l o y nos dejan aqu as no entendemos nada
4371586 tiene que haber consecuencias de las acciones de rusia contra una naci n soberana
4371587 rajoy cuenta con heredar el poder de zapatero no con gan rselo
4371588 rajoy cuenta con heredar el poder de zapatero no con gan rselo
4371589 insto a que se respete la integridad territorial y a que se cumpla el alto el fuego
4371590 rajoy cuenta con heredar el poder de zapatero no con gan rselo
4371591 rajoy cuenta con heredar el poder de zapatero no con gan rselo
4371592 i would love to see him as a coach in a giants uniform more than i would of seeing 25 on the field for the stretch run
4371593 we invested and stood behind ron both professionally and personally
4371594 i will be the first to admit that in the beginning he didnt pay enough attention to his housing situation with the dogs
4371595 but he changed he cared he did everything we suggested and more and thats all anyone can ask
4371596 one of my good friends works at the spca in houston and ive already talked to ron and suggested he continue his work down there again he was very receptive
4371597 the good thing about this staff is theyre brutally honest
4371598 it hurts some guys egos but thats the way it is youre either in or out
4371599 there was nothing older on the track than last years race cars
4371600 a lot of these old race cars were just sitting around falling apart there were airplane shows dog shows car shows but nothing for these wonderful race cars
4371601 it ran in the first grand prix and its the only one in the world
4371602 its going to run in a race just because it should be out there its awesome to see
4371603 laguna seca has always been one of my favorite tracks
4371604 for a driver its a truly technical and challenging course that provides immense satisfaction for a spectator its phenomenal because of the many vantage points
4371605 spectators get to see cars they never get to see anywhere else
4371606 you see some of the most incredible equipment in all the world
4371607 and theyre driving the wheels off these things its a kick
4371608 people dont realize how fast some of these cars can go
4371609 its live its real and the guys lucky enough to have one of these cars are willing to share
4371610 but there was that intrigue for sure of seeing what its like on this side
4371611 were talking about the chance of helping a young man get his career going
4371612 youve got four year college kids first year high school signees and teenagers from the dominican republic
4371613 but they all have one thing in common they didnt play games every day this can be a real test of their will
4371614 they give us a lot of ammunition to do the right things
4371615 she knew this was something i wanted to try but shes made a big sacrifice now that im gone all the time
4371616 the block copolymer lattice is sort of fooled by these pillars and forms its array around them they form a nice ordered pattern around the pillars
4371617 by properly choosing the spatial distribution of the pillars to match a desired final structure it was possible to consistently generate defect free polymer nanostructures
4371618 nature allows you to get these really well ordered structures without doing much work
4371619 the state of the industry in magnetic media is really ready for this
4371620 the ultimate goal would be a complete self assembling chip structure
4371621 ultimately this is a technology that is very high resolution and very scalable
4371622 its always good to know you have that in you as a team
4371623 theyve seen me three times this year they know what i have so i knew theyd be aggressive early
4371624 ive never seen supporters put up with so many mistakes and still support their team as much as the santos fans i can only congratulate them
4371625 i think at its worst it allowed the policing to targets culture to take hold in the same way that we see in other public sectors at the moment teaching to targets teaching to tests so at its worst at its most extreme it encouraged that sort of policing to targets
4371626 the paperwork certainly has changed in the 12 years that ive been in the job
4371627 there seems to be more bureaucracy created and more forms that need to be filled in just as an auditable trail basically
4371628 it shows the defence whether or not there are any issues that might undermine our case
4371629 it was getting to the point where people were chasing detections going down back alleyways trying to find people who werent standing in the middle of the street but had gone out of the way to try to find somewhere to go to the toilet
4371630 awak dah belajar solatkan kat rumah solat dengan mak ayah ye
4371631 msykt awal yg btamadun di ksan di zaman neolitik apakah ciri2 yg mmbuktikan bhw msykt neolitik sudah btamadun dgn mmbezakannya drp msykt paleolitik
4371632 they are disgusting offensive and can only be described as evil
4371633 this filth is too readily accessible if people such as you dont seek these depraved images there will be fewer abused children
4371634 children are abused violated and degraded in order to make a market
4371635 when i started accessing pornography i never intended to access these images
4371636 if i stop for a minute and think about the trade that is going on behind these images it is horrendous
4371637 it is something that you fight accessing the porn and then you come back again every couple of months
4371638 for me its very ironic that the book itself is a victim of extremism does that mean women cannot even discuss extremism
4371639 what do they want us to do lie down and shut up
4371640 we are baffled as to why the book is banned
4371641 the offender concedes that the images fall into categories eight to ten
4371642 she was unaware at the time of the offence there were victims in child pornography though she is now aware
4371643 she believed the photographs were just pictures were anonymous and harmless adjuncts to her role playing
4371644 she never thought her behaviour would amount to criminal behaviour and because of the amount of drugs in her system she never gave it a thought
4371645 child pornography is not a victimless crime children were deeply and seriously hurt through the commission of these offences and i think the penalty today reflects that
4371646 for the latter area the forecast rainfall totals would not ordinarily warrant a warning but given the already saturated conditions rivers there will need watching and slips and local surface flooding are possible
4371647 we will continue to closely monitor rainfall and river levels over the next 48 hours or so
4371648 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4371649 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4371650 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4371651 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4371652 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4371653 if they come to the conclusion that the us is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
4371654 once the dust settles we can then look at assisting georgia in rebuilding their military
4371655 this is among the ideal models from mitsubishi and it is actually positioned at the top level of sportiveness so its on a higher level in terms of pricing and specifications
4371656 maybe the volume will not be large but we want the public to know that mitsubishi has many models to offer
4371657 then relax and enjoy the reassurance that you have extra credit available if and when you need it
4371658 people may be going through a break up or they are suffering depression they may be vulnerable to these sorts of things
4371659 the evidence is that credit card default is related to unemployment illness and family breakdown not bank marketing
4371660 the australian bankers association does not believe that there is a sound argument for credit card limit offers to be banned by government regulation
4371661 we found that lenders frame their letters in various ways to make it more likely customers will not really think too hard about taking on more debt and just accept the limit increase
4371662 the letters trigger the natural human instinct to trust experts in this case experts who have already determined you can afford a limit increase
4371663 the letters also use positive words and especially avoid the word debt
4371664 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and sorrow ive brought you
4371665 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness because i dont know if i am worthy
4371666 i ask the lord to please forgive me ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4371667 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey
4371668 our police family suffered a devastating loss through aubreys ultimate sacrifice
4371669 the hardest thing is the constant presence of it its not like theres one person involved there are six
4371670 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4371671 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats
4371672 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4371673 its an incredible concentration of threatened and endangered species that are going to be affected by this road
4371674 highlights the fact that the proposed toll road route in particular the san mateo creek watershed is a vital environmental resource
4371675 a lot of work went into designing the alignment to avoid the most sensitive areas of habitat
4371676 its been a highly politicized process that hasnt relied on the best available science and thats one of the bedrock requirements of the endangered species act
4371677 the best of only in l a a chronicle of the amazing amusing and absurd
4371678 id just like to get some of this ocean breeze back in arizona
4371679 rotting fruit on the ground in the rear yard which creates rodent harborage
4371680 neither congresswoman richardson nor her attorney have received any information referring to this matter any additional information will be provided at a later date
4371681 many elected officials are married rely on two incomes or are independently wealthy
4371682 i made the decision to borrow money against my home to help finance my campaign the election was too important to me to our community and to our country to roll over
4371683 with kids on the show who were popular had money living the cool easy life
4371684 or it could be the totally opposite side of the spectrum
4371685 where the kid is totally frustrated with his dysfunctional family and thinks that if they get on tv his parents will see how big a fool theyre making of themselves and maybe theyll change
4371686 the only two i like are man vs wild and deadliest catch watching women gossip is not my forte
4371687 i dont think id want that many people seeing my family what we go through our dysfunctionality because a lot of those are our private moments why would you want other people seeing it
4371688 i used to watch the osbournes when i was in high school
4371689 ozzy was older than hell he was still cracked out and his hands were shaking at least that was funny
4371690 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4371691 south has a propensity to elect film stars as their chief ministers
4371692 chiranjeevi is starting a new party remember south has a historical tendency to vote in favor of film stars
4371693 yeh film stars ko vote de dete hain aise state ka karoge kya
4371694 the kinds of moral and ethical decisions he was facing are just the same as what marines are going through now
4371695 i think there is no better audience in the 21st century to be hearing these plays
4371696 we will not cure evil with evil for if we try the pain will only grow worse than the illness that brought it upon you
4371697 by giving up we fall on the enemys sword and the enemy has it their way
4371698 the combat stress the inner conflicts the loss of your self all are the same
4371699 this is kind of an extraordinary moment for us as artists to be able to apply our craft
4371700 he turned to me and firmly said woman silence becomes a woman
4371701 there is nothing more troubling than to discover an evil crime of which one is the culprit
4371702 gareth did very well he was an absolute delight i spoke to him beforehand and he was in the right frame of mind and wanted to play
4371703 he knew the consequences of playing just in case anything might happen in the next couple of weeks but i think he wants to get mentally focussed now about the season its a big big season for him
4371704 he did fantastically well last year and got himself into the england squad and played exceptionally well
4371705 he doesnt want to throw that away by not being fit for the start of the season
4371706 i can confidently say he can score goals in the spl and the championship because weve played hibs and sheffield wednesday
4371707 now well see if he can score goals in the premier league hes scored goals for every team hes played for and that includes his country
4371708 portsmouth football club strongly deny charges by the fa alleging a breach of their regulations concerning the transfer of benjani mwaruwari to and from the club
4371709 we did not pay an agent when benjani joined the club from auxerre in january 2006 and his transfer to manchester city in january this year was approved at the time by the premier league and the fas compliance unit
4371710 i have no idea where that story has come from no one has approached us about paul konchesky because it is pretty obvious to everyone we are not interested in the slightest about selling him
4371711 and if i was paul konchesky i would be very sad to see my name linked with a 2million transfer when i am a player who is worth a lot more than that
4371712 god only knows where that has come from there must be a reason for it someone must have an agenda and is using pauls name to further it
4371713 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee
4371714 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong unified fashion
4371715 we are in the market for a striker and made a substantial offer which has been well documented
4371716 we will have to wait and see what happens we are trying to address certain weaknesses in the team and we will continue to do that right until the window closes
4371717 we have problems up front as we are missing key personnel we are a little bit light and went with two young guys who are still learning the game it was difficult for them
4371718 i think what the bid does show is that the club is in decent shape financially and that we were able to make a bid of that significance
4371719 people think you are sometimes manic depressive i think im going to have to ask you to leave the company
4371720 customers want access to content from a broad variety of sources how when and where they choose

4371780 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away miss clark said after her guide former nuclear physicist gottlieb otto braun elwert 59 collapsed from an apparent heart attack
4371781 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to get support in an emotional miss clark said
4371782 we got to the hut door and two people went inside the hut and gottlieb came back out of the hut and collapsed on the snow miss clark said
4371783 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen i have had so many beautiful trips with him miss clark said
4371784 they did an incredible job of trying to resuscitate him they worked on him for over two hours mr crow said
4371785 but after two hours they were advised that there was really no point continuing with their efforts
4371786 she miss clark made a special effort to come out in the dark last night it was probably a bit scary coming down the mountain in the snow partially on a skidoo said ann braun elwert
4371787 we dont really know what the real cause of death is we are just guessing its a heart attack hes such a fit strong man its the last thing i thought would have taken him
4371788 it takes her about 24 hours to tune out of her special work environment and then shes like everybody else mr braun elwert said in an interview in 2000

4371795 the thing thats both good and bad about texting is that it gives us a false sense of connection its easy to be brazen funny and even raunchy to over reveal and say things you really shouldnt because theres this overwhelming sense of immediate kinship
4371796 traditionally intimacy was developed over a long series of meaningful interactions but texts create this fast and furious pace that turns so many of us on
4371797 for one your text persona should always match your non text one if youre funny and shy text that way
4371798 secondly whether its a friend colleague or potential lover you have to respond to personal texts in an appropriate time frame if youre at work its acceptable to leave it till the end of the day if its the weekend you must text back within three hours at most anything more is just rude

4371806 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
4371807 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
4371808 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage

4371835 deze cultuur heeft zich ontwikkeld gedurende 2 eeuwen van strijd proberen en overwinningen door miljoenen mannen en vrouwen die vrijheid nastreefden
4371836 wij spreken voornamelijk engels niet spaans libanees arabisch chinees japanees russisch of welke andere taal dan ook daarom zeg ik u als je deel wilt uitmaken van onze samenleving dan hebben jullie geen andere keuze dan onze taal te leren
4371837 de meeste australi rs geloven in god dit is geen rechtse radicale politieke praat maar een vaststaand feit omdat christelijke mannen en vrouwen deze natie gesticht hebben gefundeerd op christelijke principes en dit is duidelijk gedocumenteerd en het is zeer zeker gepast om dit feit te tonen op de muren van onze scholen als god u beledigt dan stel ik voor dat u overweegt om een ander deel van de wereld uw thuis te noemen want god maakt deel uit van onze cultuur
4371838 wij aanvaarden jullie geloof en zullen ons niet afvragen waarom het enige dat we van jullie vragen is dat jullie ons geloof accepteren en vredig en harmonieus met ons willen samenleven

4371840 despite being a model student athlete and person for the ncaa and despite having earned the ncaa significant revenues the ncaa has wrongfully arbitrarily and capriciously denied mr mauks request to participate in a fourth year of athletic competition for reasons completely beyond mr mauks control
4371841 thats ludicrous to even think that we would put him on the field and put our football team in harms way
4371842 we look forward to explaining more fully our reasons for the decision and the careful review given not only by our staff but also by representatives from our member schools
4371843 we believe the ncaa has treated ben differently than it has other athletes with very very similar circumstances
4371844 we cant go to barnsley and play that open because theyve got the quality to score goals against us
4371845 we wont defend for 90 minutes but weve got to be a bit tighter when we havent got the ball
4371846 we had four strikers out there on wednesday and thats why they were able to get off so many passes in the middle
4371847 robbie simpson and michael mifsud are forward thinking players and they werent always in the positions they should have been so aron gunnarsson and guillame beuzelin were left isolated at times
4371848 we need to be better organised at times there were too many gaps and thats what happens when you play two strikers in the wide positions because theyre not used to the defensive side of things
4371849 robbies a central striker he played there with leon best when we were in switzerland and looked excellent
4371850 but he put in a shift for us on wednesday and although he found it difficult in the first half he came up with two goals
4371851 i was going to take him off and he scored i thought ill give him five more minutes and he scored again then i couldnt wait any longer because id told leon mckenzie he was going on
4371852 if there were lights on the road i could have seen him earlier but i couldnt do anything because i never saw him

4371889 i forgot to put the droplets in the sink so it doesnt smell
4371890 what on earth are you talking about what the heck are those drops
4371891 remember how i told you the garbage disposal was making a nasty noise last week well i had a plumber come by and fix it
4371892 the guy came by and fixed the leak he said it was just a side effect of the previous work he did nothing to worry about and sure enough he was right i havent seen it leak since or heard it make any noise whatsoever hes really a great plumber
4371893 well about two days after the plumber was last here the smell started i called him up and he said this sometimes just happens as a side effect of having worked on the disposal
4371894 so he told me to call the local corner chemical dispenser order up this solution and put the solution in the sink a minimum of 3 times per day hes a great guy i dont even think he charged me for the phone call
4371895 you mean he charged you to come back the second time to fix what he screwed up
4371896 hey did i tell you my employer didnt make a profit again this quarter and they just let go another 20 of our work force how are these guys doing some much business and not making a profit its amazing that that can happen

4371899 bob how does chi town magazine figure out who the top plumbers are in the city
4371900 do they research as to who gets the best results for the least amount of money
4371901 no no its nothing like that chi town magazine doesnt even do the research they quote the findings of a third party who goes around to the biggest most popular plumbing companies and interviews their administrators and plumbers to find out who
4371902 i know it sounds a little bit like a popularity contest if you really look into it but it isnt this guy is one of the best trust me
4371903 i voted for the candidate who is championing universal and mandatory home repair insurance for everybody i couldnt imagine having to pay out of my own pocket to fix my sink or toilet you know the first plumbing company i called had the nerve not to accept my insurance i said id live with the problems before i paid my own money to fix my own toilet thank you and hung up on them then i called medi plumber and they said theyd accept my insurance and file the claim theyre great
4371904 did the medi plumber guy ever ask what you were putting into the disposal
4371905 bob the thing is starting to smell again how long are you going to let your place stink and fall apart
4371906 if these things dont get better or they get worse ive got the february issue of chi town magazine it has a special advertising section super lawyers in it im sure ill be able to find a great malpractice firm to sue medi plumbers

4371953 as the manager of the team there were two fundamental responsibilities

4372026 after i got that email i stopped caring about you
4372027 ive been writing this letter for about the past week i suppose thats the advantage of writing you can get the message just right and hope that the time and care you put into choosing the words makes up for the loss of feeling were one to speak them aloud i hope youre having a wonderful time at camp hearing you talk about it brings back all kinds of memories for me of the green river valley and how it feels to fall asleep to the sounds of crickets and frogs and wake up to birdsong and thats to say nothing of the people and the friendships i made in just a few short weeks i cant imagine how strong they would be if we were given the whole summer like you have of course if you do want to get away from the heat and humidity somewhere other than the bathrooms in the dining hall or the office youre more than welcome to come to my house during your time off that offer stands no matter what i know were in some kind of bizarre relationship limbo here but you are and will continue to be my friend and are always welcome to my house i know that youve told me you dont want to be in a relationship right now i can understand and respect that being in a relationship keeps you from feeling like you can simply be yourself that youre unable to be independent because there is the inclination of a second voice another opinion that should be consulted i can understand that emotion because like you ive been in a relationship for the vast majority of the past five years and above all i am your friend and i want to be able to help you through your uncertainties that being said i want you to know that i still love you i wouldnt have ever said that to you in the first place if i didnt mean it and didnt know what it meant i know that isnt what you want right now and i know it makes things infinitely more difficult for you i knew though i was putting my heart on the line again when we started this thing and right after it had just been torn apart i wasnt about to lose you again after letting you go before i was being given a second chance i wasnt going to let pass me by and i was open with you about the risk i was putting myself in its not fair to you to put the responsibility of my emotional well being on your shoulders but it isnt fair to you either to keep from you the way i feel i still love you and i still want this to work i still want to be that person youre right relationships are about giving up a part of yourself in any relationship based on any meaningful connection you give up a little bit of who you are in exchange for a little bit of the other person and you sacrifice a part of your independence for the trust and safety you feel with the other person you understand that i know you do i just want you to know that i think it is worthwhile even now going through all i went through these past few months i still think that the trust is worthwhile regardless this limbo is killing me im trying to act like nothing is wrong but it is hard for me to know what i should be holding back to cover my words please lets go ahead and have a conversation about all of this call me sometime i will understand if you want to end this i just dont want to be in the dark anymore i debated about putting your song in here but i thought it was the right thing to do i know that youll recognize parts of it i wrote it with you in mind your voice and your memories
4372028 i know you want it to end i respect that i want you to be happy and i cant be in limbo anymore lets just be friends you can still call and we can talk about this on your terms but i never meant for you to be sad about us it isnt the right thing now maybe down the line it will be but lets spend the rest of our summer enjoying conversation and time together just as friends it will be better that way

4372155 a player like mark has that experience and is able to fit a certain hole in terms of our squad list
4372156 he was the right person for that position that didnt exist off contract at the moment in rugby in australia
4372157 clinton has travelled a similar path and his opinion is one we respect
4372158 he was adamant that mark will be an absolute hit in the game
4372159 positionally weve obviously got some ideas about him playing in the back three but theres no reason why he couldnt play elsewhere
4372160 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4372161 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew

4372167 la crisis energ tica en java y bali comenzar a superarse a mediados de 2009
4372168 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4372169 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4372170 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4372171 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4372172 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4372173 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4372174 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4372175 i always knew looking back at us crying would make me laugh but i never realized that looking back at us laughing would make me cry
4372176 birds still come to the city and take seeds to parks they dont know they arent supposed to do that
4372177 just because a plant is from somewhere else doesnt automatically mean its a problem
4372178 there are plenty of exotic species that are well behaved in the garden
4372179 it really does boil down to on the individual level how much of an impact is this making
4372180 we tag something as invasive when its a tremendous pain
4372181 quite a few of the gardeners i interact with are passionate about wildlife gardening but theyre not necessarily botanists
4372182 theyll start calling things that are vigorous invasive theyre not invasive theyre just aggressive
4372183 now it wants to be everywhere and a lot of my other plants are getting crowded out
4372184 im weeding out this beautiful native wildflower that i love because its so aggressive
4372185 i tell students whats native at the bottom of mount nittany isnt native at the top you change elevation and whats native changes
4372186 so many of the things we pull our hair out over somebody brought over on purpose
4372187 it was this curious plant from asia and the idea was hey this will grow anywhere
4372188 in the industrial revolution we can grow this in these dirty smog laden cities in stuff that isnt even soil
4372189 look at the species of concern that are out there and to try and pull those and work those plants out of production
4372190 some places out there that dont care and still some plants in the trade that are problematic
4372191 shes still protecting john because she loves him and thinks they may eventually have a future together
4372192 everyone in italy and france is on a beach sunning themselves
4372193 very few people could have afforded to bury their child in such a grand fashion
4372194 they would certainly have had to belong to a wealthy family of a high status in the community perhaps at fort commander level or at senior level in the roman army
4372195 shoot on sight orders are a clear violation of the right to life and of international standards of law enforcement
4372196 the volatility of the situation in jammu amp kashmir requires more sensitivity from the authorities not a shoot on sight order
4372197 the indian authorities should conduct investigations and bring to justice police officers as well as protesters in a quick transparent and fair way in order to cool down sectarian tension
4372198 customers and dealers across america have told us they like the gas guarantee incentive option so we are providing a second month for shoppers to take advantage of it
4372199 lets refuel america the lifetime powertrain warranty and the new day packages are all examples of our commitment to deliver more value and peace of mind to our customers
4372200 oops i feel the weight packin on and suddenly feel bad about myself
4372201 but this stuff in life wouldnt happen if you got this job and became this person and fixed it
4372202 i came in and there were police officers outside they handed me a leaflet saying dont be worried theyre just looking into the neighbourhood there have been three terror arrests
4372203 it was quite hard to see which houses because there were crowds of people outside and two police cars and a van its really worrying that its so close its like oh my god who is it you cant believe its actually happening on your street in your community
4372204 the majority of our community here are kashmiri we have never had any problems and have a very good relationship with the kashmiri community and have done so for a very long time
4372205 this has had no effect on the airport it is a total police operation and we didnt even know that it had happened until afterwards
4372206 the most likely alternative is that big brains enhance the rate of evolutionary diversification by facilitating changes in behaviour which would place new selection pressures on populations and favour adaptive divergence
4372207 theres no indication that any of the aliens were involved in any terrorist activity at all
4372208 ice agents were stationed at the security gate and we reviewed all the identity documents of all the people entering at that moment
4372209 when we determined that the alienage or identity of someone inside a vehicle was in question we recommended further inspection
4372210 we believe that the main function of the tree is to facilitate the flow of water from the ground and into the atmosphere to achieve that function the tree is ideally designed to not only maximize the flow of water but in order to be successful in the real world it must also be able to withstand the stresses of the wind it is exquisitely designed to do just that
4372211 the tree is a physical flow architecture that has evolved to meet two main objectives maximum mechanical strength against wind and maximum access for water coming from the ground through the tree and into the atmosphere in the larger sense the forest itself is a flow system with the same mechanical properties and functions as the individual tree facilitating the flow of water across the globe
4372212 winds come in many speeds but their ultimate effect is cutting off trunks branches and leaves so whatever is too long or sticks out too much is shaved off so the pattern of the tree is the result of the never ending assault by the wind
4372213 if the purpose of a tree was not to transport water it would look like the eiffel tower it looks like mr french engineer gustave eiffel without knowing it designed a structure that corresponds with our constructal theory
4372214 it is supposed to show our love because we are holding hands
4372215 remember that jimbo you were the first boy i danced with
4372216 he doesnt count you were the first man to dance with me that im not related to

4372220 dont say youre sorry because im not i came over here to tell you that renee may be beautiful and the supposed love of your life but i love you maybe i didnt love you when i was ten but i loved you long enough maybe you could try loving me
4372221 i dont want excuses tell me one reason why we cant start from the beginning and see where it goes
4372222 youre in early 20s and im in my 30s you have to finish college party experience life anyway renee and i were your age when got married and look where are now in the middle of a divorce
4372223 jim kiss me again and if you feel nothing then well go on as friends
4372224 jim im not asking for marriage just dinner or a movie then taking it from there but i wouldnt say no to marriage i just cant imagine saying goodbye to you
4372225 we consider this video though it names no one to be a photographic list of an anti semitic nature and therefore liable to criminal prosecution
4372226 we are not aware of a complaint from the bnvca against youtube
4372227 youtubes terms of use prohibit inappropriate content videos that violate our terms can easily be flagged on the site by our community and our staff will take appropriate action

4372237 the biggest forgotten and neglected humanitarian emergency in the world
4372238 at first we did not know how to catch up with our neighbors to the south
4372239 but this technology is shooting us from 20 years behind to 20 years ahead in development
4372240 break the pattern of total dependency on international ngos so prevalent over the past 20 years
4372241 but at least people have the opportunity to be more informed and widen their perspectives
4372242 we can aggregate the local government offices and provide each one with internet this will help in communication with the government in kampala as well as with security
4372243 sometimes when the children are sick they need to go home with bosco we could reach their parents most of whom live in rural areas

4372249 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers have canceled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals
4372250 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
4372251 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4372252 we certainly respect mr rushdies opinion but we stand by our decision which we made with considerable deliberation and regret
4372253 not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4372254 larry and i will have a bowl of mueslix and a small shot of prune juice and be in bed by 9 oclock
4372255 well let people file by the bed and watch us go to sleep i think we can hang with the best of them until midnight
4372256 for the latter area the forecast rainfall totals would not ordinarily warrant a warning but given the already saturated conditions rivers there will need watching and slips and local surface flooding are possible
4372257 we will continue to closely monitor rainfall and river levels over the next 48 hours or so
4372258 am obtinut un acord cu statele unite pe tema scutului
4372259 i told you so oh i told you so i told you some day you come crawling back and asking me to take you in i told you so but you had to go now i found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
4372260 now i found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
4372261 in the past weve never dictated these terms to our sales teams now well document it its not that we havent been working under these principles in the past we just want to make sure were consistent
4372262 if a var is in an account ibm will not go in
4372263 our sales reps use it to see if its this kind of account he should work with a business partner or if this kind he should go direct
4372264 we have a flow chart but most decisions will default the business partner
4372265 the list shows where ibm works direct but business partners are welcome to go into those accounts
4372266 we let partners know if you want to come into this account thats ok but we prefer you work in other accounts where theres more opportunities for you and ibm
4372267 and it will be interesting to see if it makes sense to anyone reading it it could turn out to be a rube goldberg thing
4372268 ibms hardware guys are good at focusing on the channel but its software guys are more like cowboys
4372269 then theres the services side thats igs ibm global services igs is better now than it was in the past but it still has a long way to go
4372270 the pancakes in america are amazing theyre so fluffy and round

4372275 leveraging our combined expertise resources and technologies we plan to further drive the growth and success of our clients as well as our companies around the

4372290 the bush administrations reform would have little or no impact on u
4372291 i am considerate of the environment but im doing it more for my own pocketbook
4372292 north dakota is the largest state in terms of carbon sequestration and program participation

4372297 food and self sufficiency has been declining since 1963 world wide
4372298 rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard solid thinking there is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half baked solutions nothing pains some people more than having to think
4372299 i happen to think the majority of conservatives in canada are comfortable with gay marriage now they just wanted a vote on the issue they got and the case is closed
4372300 the prime minister harper had promised such a vote in the last campaign
4372301 thats funny because as i remember it it was put to a vote the first time and an open one at that

4372310 are a scathing indictment of how profoundly u s and cdc prevention efforts have failed
4372311 identifying and linking them to treatment is the only way to break the chain of new infections and begin to address the nations runaway epidemic
4372312 if african americans made up their own country it would rank 16th globally in the number of people living with hiv
4372313 its an incredible concentration of threatened and endangered species that are going to be affected by this road
4372314 highlights the fact that the proposed toll road route in particular the san mateo creek watershed is a vital environmental resource
4372315 a lot of work went into designing the alignment to avoid the most sensitive areas of habitat
4372316 its been a highly politicized process that hasnt relied on the best available science and thats one of the bedrock requirements of the endangered species act
4372317 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states
4372318 obamas people know that they have not closed the deal with hillary voters the way they would like and they just cant afford to do anything real or perceived that upsets mrs clinton and her followers so they have more than bent over to accommodate her
4372319 you do worry and i think that was something that concerned her as well
4372320 what is the turnout going to be is anyone coming to my party
4372321 she sought to be the first woman nominated for president she came up a little short but she made it easier for the next female candidate to get the brass ring many in the democratic party would like to celebrate that i think that they should celebrate that
4372322 we are the largest user of energy in the department of defense
4372323 competition for global oil is only going to get more intense and more pricey
4372324 there would be a number of plants that would be needed just to support the air forces needs alone
4372325 presidential campaign advertising should come at the end of august and then i think its going to come fast and furious
4372326 a significant amount of our resources will go to those four states
4372327 its a reassertion of the age old russian ambitions and desires for the russian empire and the so called near abroad
4372328 i really hesitate to talk about a military option at this time because i think that would escalate rather than de escalate what we want to see achieved here
4372329 theres plenty of time in the future depending on russias behavior there and in the region to talk about the other options
4372330 i think he used the issue of iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party
4372331 a lot of my taste in music stopped about the time i impacted a surface to air missile with my own airplane and never caught up again

4372337 i think it serves to make my point really that weve got all these badges that are lost and we dont know where they are and they absolutely look like a badge and can be utilized by anyone who finds them to impersonate a peace officer
4372338 johnson was no longer employed at target and was not allowed access to the property
4372339 the initial call came out that target management wanted to talk about a disgruntled employee that wrote some graffiti on the walls
4372340 some of the things that were written were obscene management approached this employee and he turned in his target badge and left he was not there by the time officers arrived
4372341 he had no history of behavioral or performance problems at target in the preceding days he worked his regularly scheduled shifts without incident
4372342 add a human face to the story of this organization
4372343 they go to the personal backgrounds of the individuals who joined and fill in some of the gaps of what they did and how they did it
4372344 typed over 10 000 little white cards and put in for a transfer to oss
4372345 registering cataloguing and channeling a great volume of highly classified communications
4372346 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4372347 ill support any decision taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia
4372348 and we not only support these decisions but will guarantee them in the caucasus and in the world
4372349 i think we can forget about talking about georgias territorial integrity
4372350 we do not want georgias breakup but neither the south ossetians nor the abkhaz want to live in the same state with a man who sends his troops against them
4372351 are not in gori have never been in gori and do not occupy gori
4372352 weve always suspected something was going on but this is the first time it has been properly documented
4372353 this is a real find for a time period that is not very well documented in that part of the world
4372354 there is absolutely no reason for anyone to go there
4372355 that has more dinosaurs in it of high quality than any other rock in the continent of africa
4372356 burn that remained on their childs arm for three or four weeks
4372357 i believe the ultimate issue is the bible on the desk
4372358 this makes us look like a bunch of hicks and thats not what this is
4372359 he got some bad counsel to make this all about the bible and god all he needed to do was say he was sorry but he wouldnt do that
4372360 to try to put this in the context of scopes would not be appropriate
4372361 this is about the safety and well being of students and protecting their constitutional rights to get an education
4372362 the student goes we support mr freshwater the bible stays
4372363 nobodys ever told me to remove my bible or to remove the other religious material hanging on my walls
4372364 and not just to take what a teacher said as a fact

4372381 generally higher value areas have experienced higher relative increases reflecting a relative under valuation in the past

4372398 we are fortunate to have two clubs who have expressed their desire to assist us fc groningen is also prepared to train school leavers to assist during the world cup at a potential base camp and at fanparks in george
4372399 the marketing was very clever keeping soccer at the forefront of everyones minds from giant six storey statues of participating team captains to toilet facilities with a miniature soccer field complete with a goal post and a moveable ball with which to aim in the urinals

4372402 i receive two editions a week on tuesdays and thursdays in pdf form and i print these out and distribute them to our grade five six and seven teachers its really improved the girls general knowledge
4372403 on a wider level learn the news broadens horizons and makes kids aware of the world out there
4372404 i guess the person in this grave could have been buried during the three month waiting period before the installation of the tombstone
4372405 when we buried our mother in 2004 there was no grave on our fathers reserved plot next to hers
4372406 they must give us an explanation this is a traumatic experience which brings painful memories and opens up wounds that had already healed we need a proper apology and compensation
4372407 our mother would have to be exhumed and reburied before tomorrow there are african family rituals that we need to observe first this means having two funerals
4372408 this is a complex process and can take some time
4372409 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4372410 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4372411 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4372412 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4372413 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4372414 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4372415 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4372416 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4372417 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4372418 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4372419 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4372420 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4372421 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4372422 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4372423 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4372424 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4372425 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4372426 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4372427 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4372428 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4372429 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4372430 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4372431 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4372432 we need to become aware that our actions regarding the planet can cause a ripple effect globally
4372433 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4372434 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4372435 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4372436 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4372437 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4372438 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary

4372444 the shutdown of the koeberg unit placed strain on the national power grid and in particular the western cape
4372445 it is also apparent the politicians of the municipality are happy to pay lip service to library services but are not willing to put the metros money where its mouth is
4372446 there is nothing quite like the feel of an old book in your hands and the smell of the paper as you turn the pages but you get to enjoy that book especially for research purposes only if it is still relevant
4372447 the biggest competitor with libraries these days are internet cafes because they provide a quick way of accessing relevant and fresh information
4372448 i find that sometimes i am forced to travel to town to make use of this facility this is one of the services that should be available at libraries so that even primary children can familiarise themselves with the internet at an early age
4372449 whether its something positive or negative we are not allowed to speak to the media but one things for sure we are getting by because of the assistance we get from outside
4372450 if there is money available why is the municipality failing to use it
4372451 the province is always having to return money to government coffers when there is so much work to be done
4372452 i then damaged one of the sets of burglar bars to make it appear that such damage had occurred during the burglary

4372471 we moved here from langa cape town in 1997 we lived in tents and we were told houses would be built for us i was happy as i have never owned a house
4372472 in 1998 we were told applications to have our houses built were approved i was among those who tore down their shacks to make space for the new house i was expecting i was also given a title deed
4372473 they started building houses in my street and i waited for my house to be built
4372474 most houses in the street were completed and only three of us were left with shacks
4372475 the people at the councillors office said i must keep on applying for a house apply for a house when i already had applied and it was approved i do not understand that
4372476 the other two people from my street that still had shacks are moving out to prepare for their houses to be built
4372477 this shack is so cold it rains and gets flooded with water i wish someone can help me solve this mystery i do not know where to turn to
4372478 you accept the existence of god but you question and perhaps even deny the power and authority of god

4372482 we need to reposition the western cape as the creative and wellness capital of south africa africa and the world
4372483 the appointment of the experienced and highly capable brent walters as acting hod demonstrates governments determination to improve service delivery in a department that has a critical role to play in building social cohesion in the western cape
4372484 but it is clear that more secondment and support will be needed
4372485 it is standard procedure that a member who is arrested gets suspended while in custody
4372486 a letter will then be sent to the provincial commissioner who will then issue instructions
4372487 i feel the organisers didnt do their job we came hear hoping to sell our merchandise and yet there are no customers
4372488 we dont usually come to small exhibitions but since we had a fashion show in johannesburg and the organisers invited us to attend this exhibition in port elizabeth we came
4372489 it cost me a lot of money to fly my merchandise here the money i paid for customs will not be returned and i havent sold anything
4372490 i think people would have found it interesting to experience the different cultures i think nothing much was done to inform people of this
4372491 i have been to pe before and have received support we are losing a lot of money we prepare food every day and there is no one to buy it i dont think i will participate in this exhibition next year
4372492 i sell eastern food and the chef is from pakistan we have done many exhibitions in south africa and were quite surprised people didnt attend this one
4372493 i have heard rumours that the exhibitors want to boycott the exhibition due to people not attending i have done everything in my power to advertise the exhibition and i did my research that the venue was the proper place to hold an exhibition
4372494 prior to changing the ramp handling company we had 24 to 34 bags tampered with per day at or tambo but now it ranges from six to eight bags
4372495 weve seen a decrease in crime at all our airports due to the increased presence of police
4372496 i moved to addo in 1997 i love living here and despite the poverty the aids pandemic and unemployment life here is beautiful
4372497 there is a lot that needs to be done here to alleviate poverty aids is shattering a lot of families causing many dysfunctional families i think more education and awareness programmes should be initiated to educate the infected and affected on how to control aids
4372498 bed and breakfast establishments are taking part in projects that alleviate poverty programmes like soup kitchens and providing employment for the locals i think people are becoming aware of the need to help each other
4372499 children in this area are sometime neglected teenagers fall pregnant at a young age and dont know how to take care of their children
4372500 poverty is the number one problem and work is scarce the citrus season helps a lot but after september when the season is over you will find youth loitering in the streets
4372501 i think this might lead to people stealing the iron for money
4372502 poverty is my main issue there are no jobs i had to lie about my age so that i could be eligible for the government pension
4372503 we welcome the fact that interest rates have not been raised again this is a small victory for cosatu members who have in recent weeks taken to the streets to protest against interest rate and price increases
4372504 we are delighted by the reserve banks decision we would like to see interest rates decreasing after all is said and done its the consumer that keeps the economy going so the government must look after the people
4372505 the beginning of an economic turnaround and will have a significant impact on sentiment and the economy
4372506 this is momentous for both the economy and the man in the street this will effectively mean that with our current inflation rate we will probably not see any real house price growth over the next year
4372507 however our economic stability and growth will continue to create jobs and thereby improve conditions for many people creating new entrants to the property market
4372508 while the decision will obviously not give any relief to homeowners who remain under financial pressure it will certainly start to stem the tide of falling sentiment
4372509 the peak has been reached and we look for a first cut in the second quarter of next year
4372510 this school is wonderful the teachers are open and willing to try new things we specifically worked with teachers to teach them how to help learners learn to read and write
4372511 it is frustrating not to have enough money to support people
4372512 we lived five minutes away from school and we loved our stay because we were taken good care of
4372513 they kept us busy with visits to the elephant park playing with the kids and holding singing concerts for us
4372514 the teachers were so eager to learn about computers so much so we had to have lunch hour classes
4372515 the people of this country have a sense of community
4372516 while people might see all the negative things we saw the richness of life and we were happy to be part of it
4372517 we visited a british website on volunteering in schools they put us in contact with calabash tours and that is how we ended up coming here

4372521 one has to be pragmatic in his position as the coach of the national rugby team
4372522 peter has shown that he is wholly committed to the process of transformation and if he decides on a certain permutation for a specific match one cannot then question his commitment
4372523 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone he should be reminded of his mandate its not all about transformation but it is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
4372524 he has created a climate on the rugby landscape for black talents to develop and one just has to recall who was included in his first springbok training group
4372525 after a few months now peter has significantly increased the pool of black talent that can do south african rugby proud and his efforts must be commended
4372526 peter has the delicate task of balancing results and transformation and no one can fault him on this score
4372527 one has to bear in mind that each game has specific needs and by selecting those players peter has gone about his business by just applying common sense
4372528 hes in a coma he cant possibly have anything to do with this
4372529 you have to be okay my life wont be the same without you please

4372535 a lot of investors who have been buying commodities not just on a global growth story but as a hedge against a weak dollar are unloading those commodities based on a much more constrained global outlook and going back into the dollar
4372536 well have some people targeting 750 in gold but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
4372537 history shows a strong and consistent correlation between weak currencies and falling stock markets
4372538 weak currencies are a symptom of a deeper problem slowing economic growth out of control inflation or structural issues that reduce the attractiveness of equities
4372539 there is still a lot of feed through from extremely high commodity prices that have to get through to the economy around the world
4372540 we are still seeing some pretty high inflation numbers all over

4372550 the chaos theory tells us that chaotic systems are systems that look random but arent

4372618 personally i think norton is one of the most annoying programs ever created and its so hard to deal with
4372619 windows live onecare seemed to be over engineered and it created serious problems for us it seemed to randomly change the network settings on certain pcs without our knowledge and other so called brand name products were just as bad
4372620 our pcs are used for point of sale pos customer support and accounting so its vital that theyre fully protected pretty much every aspect of this business is dependent on our computers being up and running at all times a virus infection would effectively shut down the business
4372621 with a relatively small number of pcs hard costs are not a big issue for us
4372622 but soft costs like my time are extremely important so we really wanted to find an anti virus solution that would provide solid protection without needing a lot of administrative attention
4372623 through word of mouth i heard that some other small businesses were running avg and were very pleased with it
4372624 i decided to give it a try and contacted walling data online to talk about the product whether it would meet our needs and what pricing and licensing options wed be looking at
4372625 i sent walling data an email to get a price quote and we were happy with it
4372626 so i placed the order they helped us to deploy the software and it was all very quick and easy
4372627 i have had to take advantage of the free support a few times for minor things
4372628 walling data helped us to diagnose and fix the problems right then and there it was nice to be able to pick up the phone to solve an it problem on the spot especially considering the kind of time constraints i usually have
4372629 because we dont have a dedicated it department to handle software problems i was very happy to discover how easy avg was to manage
4372630 we have also found that avg doesnt have any impact on pc performance most of the time you dont even know its there and the price is fantastic
4372631 we were looking for something simple and unobtrusive that would keep our pcs secure without getting in our way and we found it in avg
4372632 we very much appreciate the active support of the museum in the last several months and will continue to honour the exclusivity they granted us for the next 5 years

4372739 pinellas park die 41 j hrige terry shiavo ist heute in florida verstorben die frau befand sich nach einem herzstillstand seit 15 jahren in einem wachkoma ihr mann hatte vor gericht durchgesetzt dass die k nstliche ern hrung abgebrochen werden durfte nach 13 tagen ohne fl ssigkeitszufuhr starb shiavo
4372740 mailand der generalstaatsanwaltschaft hat berraschend das abschalten von ern hrungs und beatmungsger ten verhindert kurz zuvor hatte ein gericht auf antrag des vaters der 34 j hrigen entschieden dass die therapien beendet werden d rfen englaro ist nach einem autounfall seit 15 jahren im wachkoma kardinal camillo ruini zeigte sich ber den ersten beschluss des mail nder gerichts emp rt und sagte bald wird es auch m glich sein behinderte menschen per gerichtsbeschluss t ten zu lassen
4372741 es kommt dann irgendwann dazu dass sie die augen ffnen die augen bewegen sich meistens sind die patienten an allen extremit ten an armen und beinen gel hmt blickkontakt ist nur sporadisch m glich die vegetativen funktionen dagegen sind intakt die patienten liegen in aller regel vollpflegebed rftig im bett viele dinge werden nicht bewusst wahrgenommen es fehlt das tor zum bewusstsein
4372742 ich kenne solche berichte dass ein patient nach l nger bestehendem wachkoma wieder aufwacht nur als anekdotische einzelfallberichte aus der presse die es sicher gibt ich pers nlich habe es aber noch nie erlebt
4372743 grunds tzlich haben wir die erfahrung gemacht dass zu den allermeisten unserer bewohner eine sehr lange eine qualitativ hochwertige beziehung aufrecht erhalten wird von den angeh rigen
4372744 befremdlich dass du solange zeit in so viel aufmerksamkeit und treue in liebe ihr beistehen konntest ich wei nicht von mir ob ich dazu in der lage gewesen w re und das habe ich dann auch gelernt dass eben die beurteilung einer beziehung von au en nur sehr schwer m glich ist es kommt immer auf die beziehung eines menschen in dem fall eine sohnes zu seiner mutter an und ich habe gelernt dass das wahrzunehmen ist die kommunikationsf higkeit die beziehungsf higkeit zwischen patient und seinen angeh rigen ist auch f r mich urs chlich f r die beurteilung ob da lebenskraft ist lebensfreude sch nheit des lebens bestehen oder ob die kr fte ersch pft sind und damit auch das leben ersch pft ist
4372745 es ist dann etwas anderes wenn zum wachkoma hinzu folgekrankheiten treten dann darf man das als fortschreiten der grunderkrankung interpretieren und muss dann nicht jede einzelne dieser zus tzlichen erkrankungen mit allen medizinischen an sich gegebenen m glichkeiten bek mpfen und wenn es sich dann um ein endstadium wenn es sich als um einen sterbeprozess handelt der durch die k nstliche ern hrung dann noch verl ngert wird dann ist auch dar ber nachzudenken ob es vertretbar ist in dieser letzten phase darauf zu verzichten
4372746 nein und zwar deshalb weil wir nicht die verf gungsgewalt haben zu entscheiden ob jemand leben kann und darf oder nicht essen und trinken sind vitale bed rfnisse und die stehen jedem menschen zu egal ob er partiell bewusstlos ist oder komplett bewusstlos ist oder nicht
4372747 ich bin der meinung dass die ern hrung von wachkoma patienten nicht eingestellt werden sollte da ich der auffassung bin dass niemand ber das leben eines anderen entscheiden kann ich denke dass das jeder mensch selber entscheiden soll ich wei nur nicht wie man das durchsetzen kann generell berlasse ich diese frage lieber experten das w rde ein st ck weit der menschenw rde nicht entsprechen wenn man das einstellt wenn ich jetzt in dieser situation w re oder meine mutter w re in dieser situation dass sie wachkomapatientin w re w sste ich nicht was ich machen w rde ich bin da ehrlich ich bin der meinung dass wachkoma patienten auch weiterhin ern hrt werden sollten ich finde das richtig
4372748 mir ist sehr daran gelegen dass es sich nicht einmischt und dass es aufmerksam betrachtet wird als wir hier das ethikkonsil gegr ndet haben vor ber einem jahr da war mir daran gelegen dass auch die konomischen fragen miteinbezogen werden und nicht nur die ethisch theologische seite christliche seite isoliert betrachtet wird und deshalb m ssen wir auch schauen was kostet was und wem kommt das was hier investieren zugute und wer muss dann vielleicht an anderem ort mangel leiden und da gilt es meiner ansicht nach nicht nur die aufmerksamkeit auf das leben hier im elisabethenkrankenhaus zu richten sondern das geht ber deutschland und unser wohlstandseuropa hinaus in die armen l ndern global denken und lokal handeln da gibt es einen zusammenhang
4372749 also ich meine selbst angesichts rasant steigender kosten im gesundheitswesen pl diert niemand daf r sozusagen eine geldbeuteleuthanasie durchzuf hren das hei t niemand pl diert daf r die medizinische versorgung von pvs patienten aus kostengr nden abzulehnen ich denke die wirtschaftlichen berlegungen kommen eher durch die hintergr nde ins spiel zum beispiel bei der frage bis zu welchem kostenaufwand medizinische ma nahmen bei solchen patienten noch angemessen sein
4372750 manchmal kommt man ja mehrfach in die selben familien und sieht wie die mit der situation leiden und einem auch schildern k nnen dass der patient das vorher gar nicht gewollt hat ich finde nicht dass man immer eindeutig sagen kann das ist richtig und das ist falsch also ich kann so ein dogma f r mich nicht akzeptieren
4372751 f r mich ist geboten dass jesus sagt liebe deinen n chsten wie dich selbst dass es einen dreiklang gibt aus gottesliebe menschenliebe liebe zum n chsten und zu sich selber ich kann nicht den einen menschen den kranken den wachkoma patienten isoliert betrachten sondern ich muss wahrnehmen wie die ressourcen der familie sind wie das umfeld ist und sie auch bei den ethischen entscheiden mitber cksichtigen

4372771 de ns directie wil op ons verzoek meewerken aan snellere treinverbindingen en betere aansluitingen op schiphol voor luchtreizigers die voor een klm vlucht met de trein naar schiphol reizen gaan we het treinkaartje compenseren
4372772 we zijn wel negatief verrast maar de ontkoppeling met de randstad is erger we zagen de vluchten vooral als snelle verbinding met de randstad toch het economisch centrum van nederland
4372773 we zijn hier met een uur in frankfurt brussel of d sseldorf en met de tgv vanuit het nabije luik zijn we eerder in parijs dan op schiphol de internationale bereikbaarheid en beschikbare verbindingen zullen dus niet echt verminderen
4372774 niet vol te houden in deze tijd maar onze passagiers uit zuidnederland zijn daarom niet minder belangrijk we doen er daarom alles aan om samen met de ns de trein tot een acceptabel alternatief te maken zonder extra prijskaartje dat zal bij een klm vlucht door ons worden betaald
4372775 we kunnen met het missen van een vliegverbinding met de randstad leven mits als alternatief betere en snelle verbindingen ook echt worden gerealiseerd
4372776 de luchthaven is geprivatiseerd er moeten alternatieven worden gevonden omdat de luchthavens om ons heen nu eenmaal ook goede verbindingen hebben

4372791 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face

4373003 youve got to break a world record to win i gave it my all i had nothing left ryan handed me a great race i have no regrets it really doesnt take anything away from my career a race is a race you can get beat no one owns anything
4373004 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and get out to an early lead
4373005 i knew that was a hard double for ryan in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4373006 you were under world record pace at the 50 why so aggressive

4373019 together with our european marketing partner takeda we concluded that requesting reexamination of the initial chmp opinion is a feasible option for making this important drug available as a controlled pharmaceutical product to patients throughout europe as we are allowed to do in canada following the recent marketing authorization under conditions for catena in that country we are aware of the challenges of such reexamination processes but we believe that the clinical benefit afforded to friedreichs ataxia patients was underestimated in the initial assessment

4373022 the investigation established additional undeclared spending of 1 460 21 however total spending did not exceed the 30 000 threshold the failure to declare the additional spending was explainable and not a criminal act
4373023 for the latter area the forecast rainfall totals would not ordinarily warrant a warning but given the already saturated conditions rivers there will need watching and slips and local surface flooding are possible
4373024 we will continue to closely monitor rainfall and river levels over the next 48 hours or so

4373029 we now know that hivcide i was clearly superior to the triple drug combo cocktail in all parameters we observed
4373030 the novel mechanism of action of hivcide i defines a new class of anti hiv drugs this enables that it can be combined with the existing cocktail in such a combination a much greater level of effectiveness could be achieved compared to what is possible today
4373031 if our preliminary results can be duplicated in humans it is quite possible that hivcide i either alone or in combination with the current combo cocktail may provide a functional cure for hiv aids
4373032 we are pleased to have met our primary endpoint for improvement in cfa with trizytek and this achievement is a major milestone for our company the outcomes were driven by the strong positive data from the 26 centers in the u s where we will be initially seeking approval upon completion of our long term safety studies
4373033 our overall top line results were affected by a marked difference between patients within the u s and outside of the u s although we have not yet analyzed individual patient data on aggregate patients from 3 out of 6 non u s countries did not appear to show a difference between trizytek and placebo groups
4373034 we are currently investigating possible factors that may have affected the results outside the u s and upon completion of the investigation we will report the findings moving forward we have requested a pre nda meeting with fda to discuss these results and we remain committed to driving trizytek toward commercialization
4373035 the data are very compelling and the results from the cf centers in the u s confirm the phase 2 study which was conducted solely in the u s during my 20 years of treating cf patients i have seen significant advancements in patient care and trizytek is a good example of an innovative drug that has the potential to enhance nutritional outcomes which are strongly correlated with pulmonary status
4373036 trizytek has the potential of being formulated for young children and other patients who cannot swallow capsules
4373037 we are very encouraged by the trizytek efficacy data because this treatment will offer important new benefits to cf patients who need enzyme replacement therapy
4373038 currently the dosing regimens for enzymes can be a challenge for patients the one capsule per meal dosing for trizytek will help drive better compliance and therefore enhance long term patient health outcomes since 2000 the foundation and altus have worked together toward a goal of bringing this new treatment to the market the data reported today reinforces our business model of supporting highly innovative therapies for cf patients
4373039 the trizytek clinical program demonstrates our commitment to advancing novel enzyme replacement therapy options for both cystic fibrosis patients and others who suffer from pancreatic insufficiency due to the uncertainties with therapeutics that contain animal derived ingredients we believe there is a need for new products that are derived from recombinant technology such as trizytek i would like to thank all of the investigators study coordinators dieticians patients and patient families who participated in this trial in addition i would like to acknowledge the cystic fibrosis foundation for its continuing support reaching this milestone was a great group effort by all parties involved

4373043 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4373044 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4373045 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4373046 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4373047 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4373048 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4373049 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4373050 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations

4373052 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4373053 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4373054 weve always suspected something was going on but this is the first time it has been properly documented
4373055 this is a real find for a time period that is not very well documented in that part of the world

4373077 the low rate of purchase intent among truck owners suggests that industrywide sales may not experience a quick rebound
4373078 many factors in addition to the pre buy and new emission technology could be playing a role in the current sales slump with the poor economic climate and rising fuel costs both owner operators and fleets are struggling to stay profitable thus it has never been more important for manufacturers to provide trucks that experience little to no downtime have low maintenance and ownership costs and provide the performance that drivers demand
4373079 whether theyre a passenger carrier or a cargo carrier most carriers that are going over or flights that are going over to asia require a fuel stop
4373080 anchorage is facing numerous delays whether its due to congestion on the ground or congestion in the skies above
4373081 and the way prince george is geographically positioned we can take advantage of some of those carriers that are flying over top of us
4373082 maybe what we can do is just take a portion of the fuelling traffic that is using anchorage right now and move them here
4373083 so that they can do more effectively the things they do and we can service their customers and in turn our customers and build a product for ourselves
4373084 what were building prince george and this corridor to become is a major north american gateway for goods to and from asia its really exciting
4373085 our whole region is going to benefit from this because from prince george to prince rupert we have a corridor thats probably the most under served transportation corridor in north america right now

4373090 through our cox conserves program we are actively reducing our companys carbon footprint and these trucks are part of the larger solution not only are they better for the environment but they also reduce our overall fuel costs
4373091 we are committed to our owner operators and their success here at barr nunn we will continue to find ways for them to earn more money we value our business partners and this is just another way we prove it
4373092 turned in commendable results despite a challenging business environment and the inflationary effect of unprecedented fuel prices
4373093 the statistics from this most recent study show that the efforts of law enforcement agencies to focus on the most likely causes of crashes such as speeding and impaired driving are making our highways safer
4373094 we still have room to improve safe driving habits of truck drivers and passenger vehicle drivers

4373118 the awarding of this exploration licence will benefit the local area and the state
4373119 it will generate funding for infrastructure and services such as hospitals schools and roads
4373120 the nsw government says this is an exploration licence but really its the go ahead for massive coal mines that will rip the heart out of the gunnedah plains
4373121 the government will pocket 675 million but abandon farmers and its responsibility to tackle climate change all for the profits of a foreign owned company
4373122 this study needs to look at the underground and surface water flows of the liverpool plains prior to any further exploration or mining taking place as we are particularly concerned by the governments assertions that strict environmental regulation will prevent any impacts on aquifers
4373123 there are concerns from our members about the impacts of coal mining activities on agriculture and the failure by government to consider these impacts when deciding to release new mining tenements

4373128 they risk their lives every single day it is not a comparison we run and get tired these guys get up at 5 in the morning run and get trained
4373129 they are on call not knowing where they could go overseas there is no comparison
4373130 seeing them picks us up and makes us work harder because we know what they do every day in their training
4373131 its nice coming out here and watching them practice its great
4373132 its good training you always have to give 100 percent and you have to be able to count on the people around you that is the same with us you have to be able to count on the people you are with as people and soldiers

4373140 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4373141 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4373142 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4373143 its different being here on the base but its good to be at home
4373144 its good being able to come back and show the hometown people what i can do

4373156 whoever says subhan allah wa bihamdihi one hundred times a day will be forgiven all his sins even if they were as much as the foam of the sea
4373157 there are two words which are dear to the beneficent allah and very light easy for the tongue to say but very heavy in weight in the balance they are subhan allah wa bi hamdihi and subhan allah al azim
4373158 the most beloved of speech according to allah is when the servant says subhanallahi wa bihamdihi how transcendent is allah and we praise him

4373165 in an effort to cast himself as independent of the influence of money on politics senator barack obama often highlights the campaign contributions of 200 or less that have amounted to fully half of the 340 million he has collected so far but records show that one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr obamas republican rival or senator hillary rodham clinton his opponent in the democratic primaries raised in contributions of that size behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington given his decision not to accept public financing mr obama is counting on his bundlers to help him raise 300 million for his general election campaign and another 180 million for the democratic national committee an analysis of campaign finance records shows that about two thirds of his bundlers are concentrated in four major industries law securities and investments real estate and entertainment

4373168 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4373169 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4373170 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4373171 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4373172 otherwise people would begin to call into question his ability to run the country and accuse him of being spineless
4373173 the political process can always be looked at either through a telescope or a microscope
4373174 if you look up close of course much is changing but if you take the longer view it turns out that the system was totalitarian and continues to be totalitarian
4373175 the left hand trait is really impressive for how fluid secure and precise it is
4373176 despite all the perplexity that it may cause also regarding the lack of information on its provenance the work is at least for now the most important find since the identification of the lady with an ermine
4373177 there were only very few artists of that caliber then
4373178 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control and it would ratify their continuing engagement with the military force until everything is worked out but it doesnt say that the forces will be replaced
4373179 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4373180 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4373181 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4373182 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4373183 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned

4373185 lewis heikki and the entire team performed excellently achieving three race wins in a row since the beginning of the previous season we have won 13 out of 28 races and if possible we want to improve this success rate however the maiden race in valencia will be a new game for everybody
4373186 when you think about temporary street races in formula 1 you mainly think about monaco however valencia does not have very much in common with this classic race just that both cities are located on the mediterranean coast and that both circuits lead along the harbour front while the monte carlo race is the slowest of the year with an average speed of about 156km h for the fastest lap and is also the shortest with a race distance of almost 254km we face a race distance of 310 km in valencia and a track on which the cars will reach 300km h or more five times per lap three times per lap the drivers also have to brake to about 80km h which will be as extremely demanding for the brakes as the montreal circuit the longest full throttle section will be along the harbour where the drivers will drive at full throttle for 13 sec the front straight is 185 metres long and the shortest of all formula 1 circuits this year we calculated an average speed per lap of 225km h which will be the eighth fastest of all grand prix tracks this is not typical for a street race it is more like a version of silverstone or monza but located in a city

4373188 in terms of car set up we need to remember that like monaco the track will be both green and dusty on the opening day of practice that sometimes tempts you into playing with set up more than you would like so you need to resist that temptation and let the track come to the car our simulations suggest well employ a downforce level similar to that of hockenheim but the individual demands of the track may push that window up or down finally anybody whos studied any onboard footage of the circuit will be mindful of the proximity of the concrete barriers in certain areas clearly well be packing plenty of spares but hoping we wont need to use them
4373189 the most important thing is to be thorough methodical and iterative although we arrive at a new racetrack having undertaken a huge amount of research and armed with an enormous amount of data the reality is that its really only the starting point for our engineering team we begin friday practice the way we would at any other circuit but in this instance we need to pay particular attention both to driver feedback and the data generated from the car the important thing is not to react too hastily its vital that you dont end up going down the wrong path because you only have a limited amount of time to tune the set up before qualifying
4373190 clearly spain has become a tremendously important market for formula 1 over the past five years and the addition of a second spanish race to the calendar rightly reflects the sports success and popularity in the market
4373191 everything weve seen about the city and the organisation of this event leads me to believe it will be a fantastic success and set a new standard for formula 1
4373192 to be honest i already spend quite a lot of time between the races analysing the data and keeping fit this summer break gave me the opportunity to get away from that and focus on just recharging my batteries looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
4373193 im wary of making predictions the race in hungary showed just how unpredictable formula 1 can be and thats one of the reasons why its such a fascinating sport clearly though i am still in a good position to challenge for the world championship and that remains my aim we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and are confident well be competitive this weekend the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
4373194 i had very much a working holiday i spent some time in woking with my engineers preparing for this weekend and i also spent some time back in finland at my home town of suomussalmi where i help organise an annual karting event in the town obviously having just won the most recent grand prix made it a fantastic event for everybody it was my first time back in finland for quite a long time too so it was great to turn up as a grand prix winner
4373195 the win doesnt change too much really i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races and im really looking forward to that
4373196 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4373197 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4373198 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4373199 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4373200 the fig and the ioc are the proper bodies to handle this
4373201 der madonna hype bertrifft alle erwartungen wir brauchen mehr dvds
4373202 ich wei noch nicht ob das die letzten spiele f r mich sind
4373203 ich habe meine letzten kr fte gegeben und genau das wollte ich ich wollte aus diesem becken raussteigen und sagen k nnen leute das wars es ging nicht besser
4373204 sie bekommt einen platz damit jeder der reingeht sieht dass ich eine olympia medaille gewonnen habe
4373205 da bin ich ganz stolz drauf ich glaube ich werde sie ganz sch n einrahmen lassen denn die medaille ist besonders sch n sie ist einzigartig

4373207 f r alles andere habe ich genug zeit um dar ber nachzudenken vielleicht h re ich dann auf zu schwimmen
4373208 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted material
4373209 copyright licences are designed to support the right to exclude money damages alone do not support or enforce that right
4373210 the choice to exact consideration in the form of compliance with the open source requirements of disclosure and explanation of changes rather than as a dollar denominated fee is entitled to no less legal recognition indeed because a calculation of damages is inherently speculative these types of licence restrictions might well be rendered meaningless absent the ability to enforce through injunctive relief
4373211 the court has held that free licences such as the creative commons or cc licences set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work
4373212 when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the gpl general public license and all cc licences put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licences which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the licence
4373213 the gpl is another example of a licence that depends on copyright law for enforcement because its a copyright licence not a contract although this model train case is about a different licence because the us is a legal system based in part on case law every decision matters
4373214 ihnen geht es den umst nden entsprechendgut die bundesregierung ist ber ihre freilassung sehr erleichtert
4373215 zwar l sst die dynamik auch am arbeitsmarkt nach wir rechnen aber trotzdem f r 2009 noch mit leicht besseren zahlen als in diesem jahr
4373216 vor dem hintergrund der warnsignale aus der wirtschaft mit risiken verbunden
4373217 die zahlen beobachten wir genau sie sind aber f r den arbeitsmarkt im moment nicht entscheidend
4373218 whenever we come to europe we always say the same thing the athletes are so skilled
4373219 i am not going to give up the dream of both koreas living well together
4373220 become a responsible member of the international community as soon as possible and that korea and the us would be able to help the north actively through international financial organizations
4373221 the best classical music in the area presented in a way that is cool in classical music cool and well done rarely come together you get great but not cool i like to say cool because it means the same thing to many different people
4373222 we have engaged the services of a new young director who embodies the experience animated excited emotional and engaging this wonderfully philosophical and generous gesture of corebrands signals very clearly what is new and different about the stamford symphony
4373223 brand is everything you do and say your behavior your culture
4373224 every organization has a brand whether they manage it or not and every organization has to continually renew itself the symphony is a terrifically well run organization and i knew they would make the most of it
4373225 its an organization that has put so much energy and effort into finding the right music director into making their programming much more eclectic and diverse fun and fresh theyve done so much to bring young people in we wanted to bring their visual and verbal identity up to the level of the programming which is outstanding
4373226 but in this case it was the opposite our marketing has finally caught up with our product an orchestra is like a woman we spend a little more time getting dressed than a man a man just puts on a shirt and pants we think about what goes with what what kind of effect do we want to produce it takes longer but its worth it
4373227 itll be fun for our current team to play against the pros olson said
4373228 its going to be a lot of fun to go up against guys like channing frye said withey a 6 foot 10 215 pound center
4373229 theyre probably tired after coming in from a bunch of summer camps he said
4373230 but this is one of the best camps out there you get to know the coaches and the surroundings around the program this is really good and its fun
4373231 my lipstick was the exact same shade of orange as my dress and it wasnt even sheer lipstick it was opaque i look at the pictures and wonder what was i thinking
4373232 theres a fine line between being caught in the moment and being the moment
4373233 i for one love a glamour girl but ive seen some horror stories way too much blush a colorful shadow and bright lips
4373234 its really important to apply cosmetics with a sense of balance and perspective
4373235 too much of everything is a problem so sometimes is too little
4373236 is that it can be a full time job to find what works for you and when you find things you do love you have a tendency to stick with them which eventually can make you look dated
4373237 i did the shimmery white eyeshadow on my eyelids with major black eyeliner and false lashes galore on my top lash line finishing the look with super pale cheeks and bright red lipstick
4373238 moral of the story modify trends so they are wearable and work for you
4373239 its all brown or black which wasnt right for me
4373240 but until then i was stumped so i didnt bother
4373241 a little bronzer mascara and lip gloss for example there are simple ways to keep yourself current without adding a lot of time to your morning routine
4373242 try some of the new mineral based products they are very sheer and it is hard to go wrong with them
4373243 it is like putting a flashing light on your face that says look at my dark circles fine lines and bags
4373244 blend evenly from the face down to the neck for more natural coverage
4373245 stick with something pink or peachy especially as you age
4373246 but many women dont get at the base of their lashes and just do the ends you lose a lot of the benefits when you dont get in there
4373247 if you have been wearing the same thing for a decade or more you need to update
4373248 a lavender shirt worn with lavender eyeshadow is too much
4373249 its not so much about being a girl its about being a funny comic
4373250 never let anyone tell you that you cant do anything because everybody no matter what you do you can always go for it
4373251 youve got to do what youve got to do to get to the top
4373252 my first year i ate a moth my second year i ate a squito my third year i ate a what did i eat my third year
4373253 my third year i dont even remember what i ate but i was planning on eating a beetle this year but we didnt go up there
4373254 it was good and very competitive said olson who was joined by ua associate head coach mike dunlap in greece
4373255 we had the opportunity to see some of the top european kids
4373256 it was good to be out and good for the kids to see me said olson noted for being a dogged recruiter
4373257 it also gave me a chance to see the other coaches that i hadnt seen during the year
4373258 i am very happy with how things have gone were on the top kids
4373259 one and done recruits after brandon jennings opted to head to europe instead of coming to ua
4373260 i just think for the continuity of the program its important we try to avoid one and dones olson said
4373261 that doesnt mean were not going to take a guy who looks like hes going to stay two years
4373262 nowadays for some of the top recruits its not very likely theyll stay more than two years he said
4373263 because these guys are my team and i want to give back in a little way what they give me
4373264 i was yelling so loudly in the building i was living in other people thought something was wrong
4373265 i really like the setup here and the way weve been treated the atmosphere is pretty neat
4373266 we wanted to try it see how we liked it this is great well see where it takes us from here hopefully theyll want us back
4373267 no doubt if they want to come wed love to host it
4373268 any time we can host an event that the community gets excited about thats a good day for us
4373269 it is always good for them to be a part of the military community coming out to support the troops fraser said
4373270 it is not only good for the troops but for the high school and the community
4373271 sierra vista is a small community and any time you bring in an outside event such as this it boosts morale
4373272 thats crazy to know that when theyre all the way over there theyre watching us play football and caring about us
4373273 just the fact that they take time out of their lives when theyre going through a war thats insane
4373274 i made it a point to tell my boss last week that i was not going to go to work for a couple of hours thursday and friday in the morning our busiest time
4373275 but they know how big a fan i am they said yeah and im here
4373276 l ike every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4373277 when a movie overperforms the way dark knight has you really dont need harry potter in the fall
4373278 turning a battleship that big isnt easy youre not talking just about the movie but all the merchandising the toys and stuff its huge and it has a domino effect across the rest of the summer slate
4373279 i have a great idea lets move hp from nov to july
4373280 oh we should have put that potter film for november eh champs
4373281 theyre the ones with the guns i cant really argue
4373282 but if they want to come out one afternoon and get something together well have a little fun with them
4373283 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4373284 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4373285 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4373286 mike and chris pioneered the genre more than 18 years ago and have shaped the sports talk format into what it is today

4373290 we are well positioned for growth in our core energy markets where our products enable a new level of energy efficiency for green building and automotive design
4373291 demand for improved energy efficiency in the automotive and window film markets is reflected in our second quarter results due to the seasonality of our business the second quarter is an important quarter and a significant contributor to our annual revenue and net income
4373292 the industrial flexibility that dfis nano surface chamber coating system offers is unmatched in both production capabilities and overall efficiency we are now set to grow the brazilian market with multiple regional alliances weve established in order to have complete nationwide coverage through the key partnerships in each respective market segment
4373293 the implementation of dfis first industrial cvd chamber system in brazil sets an important milestone not only for the vast brazilian market but throughout south america our nano coating surface treatment provides a superlative added value coupled with an unparalleled production capability of treating large volumes resulting in a very attractive element in todays economy
4373294 brazil not only represents the largest market in south america but it also provides a dynamic market in many respects with its own life and market culture the ultimate diversification value we always look for

4373300 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners

4373305 since the outset of my administration i have emphasised that corruption eradication occupied a high priority the manifestation of a corrupt free indonesia must gain support from all of us
4373306 this is the only way that indonesia can enhance its dignity in the eyes of the world
4373307 we should actually be grateful because the food situation in our country is relatively better than in many other countries
4373308 in the midst of the current global food crisis we must reinforce our national food stock
4373309 this does obviously go against the move of restraining demand but that has been accommodated by a relatively tight monetary stance
4373310 unlike the private sector government staff dont get productivity increases as each year goes by you have to do it through this massive exercise
4373311 i was told that the forward was diving for a violation call to win a corner kick it is a common tactic but i dont think the chinese forward played it wisely this blunder only revealed his or the teams lousiness
4373312 i know it would be devastating to all of us but i wish we would get caught were such a crooked company
4373313 no no no you must have it all wrong it cant be that thats just too bad too fraudulent surely aa amp co wouldnt let them get away with that
4373314 go back to the drawing board its got to be something else but find it
4373315 hey just in case you might be right try and find some insiders or redeployed former employees to validate your theory
4373316 for the latter area the forecast rainfall totals would not ordinarily warrant a warning but given the already saturated conditions rivers there will need watching and slips and local surface flooding are possible

4373340 people must understand there simply is no water available to pump into ailing systems
4373341 there is some water that could be sent down but the transmission losses in a river like the darling and the murray are just enormous
4373342 a megalitre at bourke is not a megalitre at the menindee lakes theres certainly nowhere near a megalitre at wentworth and theres nothing at the bottom of the river so thats the problem the prime minister has and water minister penny wong has and the government has

4373362 this evenings launch of amc 21 is a great achievement beginning with the ordering of the spacecraft in the spring of 2006 to its launch today the entire mission was completed in 27 months it is also a proud moment for the thales orbital team who partnered to build and deliver an exceptional spacecraft and for the ariane team who has just launched its 30th spacecraft for ses
4373363 we now look forward to bringing amc 21 into service as we will be establishing a new ku band enterprise and broadcast neighborhood in the north american arc at 125 degrees west anchoring the new satellite will be the public broadcasting service and several of their local broadcast affiliates the satellite will also be used for new applications such as maritime mobile broadband
4373364 amc 21 was the result of some unique design requirements established by ses which allowed thales and orbital to partner and play to our mutual strengths for this particular mission
4373365 our relationship with ses has been successful for more than a decade and we are now looking ahead to the fall 2008 launch of ciel 2 for the ses canadian affiliate ciel satellite group
4373366 i would like to thank ses for having the confidence that arianespace would deliver amc 21 safely into orbit amc 21 is the thirtieth satellite that arianespace launched for ses a successful collaboration of more than two dozen years

4373402 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4373403 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4373404 they used a john mellencamp song until he made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4373405 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself

4373467 investors have different opinions as to what the value of those companies are given the tremendous difficulties they face
4373468 for the average american these inflation numbers are very bad news it means that their purchasing power has been cut and their wages arent going very far

4373477 this settlement isnt an admission its a recognition that life is short
4373478 rather than spend her energy fighting a lawsuit without end she decided shed rather devote her talents and time to making positive change in our society
4373479 seems to be in line with other settlements the sec has done both from a monetary standpoint and its impact
4373480 i cherish the great people i worked with at apple and i am proud of my contributions to its historic turnaround and current success
4373481 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4373482 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4373483 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4373484 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4373485 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4373486 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4373487 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4373488 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4373489 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach

4373497 you are god in physical body you are spirit in the flesh you are eternal life expressing itself as you you are a cosmic being you are all power you are all wisdom you are all intelligence you are perfection you are magnificence you are the creator and you are creating the creation of you on this planet
4373498 claiming to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things therefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts because they exchanged the truth about god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever amen

4373518 so give me some ideas on what you might think happened to one of my things which was a sexy red something something that i intentionally tucked discreetly away but where it would be found by my intended as a teasing memory and that became missing and still lost even months and months later
4373519 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4373520 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4373521 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4373522 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4373523 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4373524 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations

4373534 go and measure the temple of god and the altar and count those who are worshiping in the temple but do not measure the outer courts because they have been given to the heathen who will trample on the holy city for forty two months i will send my two witnesses dressed in sackcloth and they will proclaim gods message during that 1 260 days
4373535 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4373536 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4373537 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4373538 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4373539 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4373540 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4373541 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4373542 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4373543 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4373544 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4373545 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4373546 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4373547 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4373548 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4373549 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4373550 to make sure there is peace and stability in the region
4373551 the united states is committed toward securing a diplomatic resolution with iran on the nuclear issue
4373552 we want iran to play a responsible role in the region
4373553 there is not a clash of civilizations but its a clash of ignorance that all sides need to work on
4373554 i think the one of the most successful steps in our journey to win was to speak to farmers we went out to a farm in the country who a team members parents were familiar with the owners talked to the owner and the farm operators to learn first hand about farming and the problems they are facing
4373555 eu penso que uma das etapas as mais bem sucedidas em nosso caminho foi falar com os fazendeiros n s fomos para uma fazenda no pa s cujos propriet rios eram conhecidos de um dos nossos membros falamos com propriet rio e aos operadores de explora o agr cola para aprender em primeira m o sobre o cultivo e os problemas que est o enfrentando
4373556 historical battle imagery and the social impact of conflict combat the stylization of war and the viewpoint of victory
4373557 set builders makeup artists actors models stylists and stunt crews
4373558 to continue with the process of change in democracy and peace
4373559 the bolivian government is going to guarantee autonomy for all of bolivia but within a framework of legality and constitutionality
4373560 i feel the opposing governors only want the silver money and do not wish to deal with other matters without considering what the bolivian people think
4373561 i conclude that the bolivian people want autonomy they want a new political constitution
4373562 now no governor can talk about two thirds more than two thirds of the people want to unite the new constitution with the statutes for autonomy
4373563 while the comparisons against us were softer than of late that in no way detracted from the strength of the performance given the extremely challenging trading conditions we are in
4373564 many branches commented on the effect of unsettled weather last week which clearly drove footfall into our shops compared to a year ago
4373565 this appears to be the first example of cryptic female choice found in an externally fertilizing species
4373566 we were startled to find that female salmon are also able to exert this kind of influence previously it had been thought that once their eggs had been released females had very little say over which of the males around her would fertilize them
4373567 we found that the speed of a males sperm varied significantly according to which females ovarian fluid it was swimming in
4373568 this resolves the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4373569 the libyans didnt believe that congress would ever be helpful and congress didnt think libya would ever do it
4373570 we found a diplomatic way to accommodate both sides by turning suspicion into an asset
4373571 both parties welcomed the establishment of a process to provide fair compensation for their respective nationals and thereby turn their focus to the future of their bilateral relationship
4373572 this could not have worked without a great deal of honesty on everyones part
4373573 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terror against american victims
4373574 the signing of this agreement means these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve todays agreement is a critical development in moving libya forward on its path toward diplomatic respect
4373575 agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4373576 as soon as lugo begins to change things the attacks will start but thank god we have the support of our people new winds are blowing in latin america which is truly living a new era

4373581 and it was clear to me that reagan beat them all hands down none of these guys today can hold a candle to the gipper dead or alive
4373582 so frigging what hes going to be the vice president its not like were asking him to do anything productive
4373583 where in the constitution does it say that the vice president has to be living as far as i know all he has to be is a native born american whos at least 35 years old done and done
4373584 do you think id be announcing his addition to the ticket if he didnt agree havent you ever heard of the concept that silence implies consent well i think most people have and when i put the question to ronnie he was about as silent as you can get
4373585 after vetting the short list of potential democrats it was blindingly obvious that i was by far the most qualified
4373586 my father clearly remembers his mother buying his eighth grade graduation suit a brown pinstripe at hechts reliable on broadway one of the companys earliest stores
4373587 did you really think you could win my loyalty as hechts did
4373588 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen
4373589 whatever you do you bastard dont f in kick me just dont f in kick me
4373590 in all that time ive never seen a more controversial choice
4373591 because of both the language and the sophistication of the story its not a comfortable or happy reading experience
4373592 but it has been recognised for its artistic excellence and the brilliance of the story and we are an awards for literary merit
4373593 that reflects the depth of quality within the australian childrens book industry
4373594 the prisoners languishing in the prisons of tyrants be it infidels apostates or hypocrites christians or jews or infidels idolater and apostate
4373595 a couple could pretend to be joking before attacking the target
4373596 this would lead to his eyes nose and mouth being plugged and loses the ability to breathe
4373597 this type of weapon is excellent in close combat where fire arms are not desirable
4373598 its been like this as far as i can remember we build houses then fighting occurs we leave and return home and build our houses again
4373599 being alive after all the troubles just makes me thankful despite the difficulties
4373600 well have winds coming in off the ocean that will help cool us off saturday night into sunday
4373601 im not going to get paid signature gatherers im a teacher im not rich
4373602 any wrongful conduct that affects interrupts or interferes with performance of official duty
4373603 is supported by the record and demonstrated by the fact that the port commission had to hold a public meeting in order to undo comm daviss contract with dinsmore
4373604 davis understood her duties as port commissioner and the legal necessity of voting in public session before potentially obligating the port in any monetary agreement and for purposes of recall intentionally acted outside the scope of these duties by signing an agreement with dinsmore
4373605 in the hands of voters now and i think it needs to run its course
4373606 its fairly rare to find a calf so soon after it was born
4373607 its fairly rare to find a calf so soon after it was born
4373608 the first couple of years are usually the most precarious
4373609 that fear has been behind some of the hesitation in getting people to come forward
4373610 he had a mexican passport a visa issued by the u s government
4373611 he hadnt overstayed the visa he was allowed to be in the country and had no intention of staying
4373612 we want them to know that there are people watching
4373613 the law was written broadly enough that it swept in speech that was protected as well as speech that could be threatening
4373614 did not verbally threaten the woman with violence and no actual violence took place
4373615 harassment and annoyance are among common reactions to seeing or hearing gestures or words that one finds unpleasant
4373616 information floating around in the ether we dont have any way to stop that or go out there scrubbing the record
4373617 picking up all the breadcrumbs would be a herculean task
4373618 spu is still a school like the kkk in my opinion
4373619 sound reason to believe that mr feyissa is a threat to persons on campus
4373620 do you know how many girls after they see that we go on a date and they dont want to see me again
4373621 we explained to them if they wanted to start down a path of removing historical archives and pulling it from the public sphere what theyre doing is censorship
4373622 we basically said sorry we have principles in journalism that dont allow us to put stuff in the memory hole and pretend it never happened
4373623 shakespear feyissa may not like the story but that doesnt mean he should get to dictate what gets removed from a newspapers online archive
4373624 a newspaper serves as the paper of record for a community i dont think that function changes when the content moves online
4373625 the student editors decided it was their right or whatever to keep online what they wanted
4373626 its not a matter of someones rights being violated its just a matter of wisdom is it the prudent thing to do
4373627 id love to have the students pay for it next time
4373628 its a private university they have every legal right to come in and take this article down but for some reason theyre asking my permission to take it down
4373629 thats permission i cannot give because of journalistic ethics which i might add we are taught at this school
4373630 if the school thinks that its ability to erase the record of someone who once upon a time was accused of a crime is more important than its ability to provide a media education its free to do that
4373631 we have performed very well in recent friendlies they have been great attacking performances so it is not something that concerns me
4373632 we are aware there are only two weeks to go before the end of the window that is something we are working on constantly anyway
4373633 we work without rest to look for players and weve always known the deadline day is the august 31
4373634 we are working calming in the background on one or two things we prefer to work with as much discretion as we can
4373635 i will wait until the final training session and see how he is in training thats when i will make a decision on that
4373636 hes an excellent pro hes been working totally independently to anything that might be happening outside the football and any speculation has been dealt by his agent
4373637 hes just been getting on with things professionally in training
4373638 my goal was to arrive in pre season get my head down and give the manager a headache at wigan
4373639 but when you are told your first team opportunities are limited it kind of takes the wind out of you
4373640 luckily the gaffer here said that hed like me to try to help hull
4373641 i never wanted to leave wigan and i still havent but im glad its been resolved and im looking forward to tomorrow and playing my part
4373642 people talk about failing a medical but thats nonsense id played another 50 or 60 games since my injury
4373643 but thats football its business there are no hard feelings against fulham watford at the time did not want to renegotiate the deal
4373644 whether it be arsenal man united fulham whoever it is im looking forward to being part of history hulls first game in the premier league
4373645 there is no better opportunity to get three points than at a full kc against fulham
4373646 everybody here is upbeat and enthusiastic about trying to get the first points on the board on saturday
4373647 the individuals who installed these speed humps may have been trying to make a point but they were creating a hazard and causing potential problems for other users
4373648 well we already solved the problem and it only cost us 900
4373649 anytime you install a hazard in a roadway its going to change traffic patterns
4373650 so much money has been invested here youd think the city wouldnt just neglect us
4373651 the vehicle from the impact launched the girl approximately 20 feet in the air
4373652 our role in the government will be to accomplish the historical task of writing a new constitution and fulfill the peoples desire of progressive transformation of the country
4373653 todays candidacy has confirmed that there would be a national government commanding a two third majority so the nc understanding this ground reality should join the government
4373654 i will again request nc for the same and i hope nc will join us
4373655 i applaud the mayor for being prudent because if were going to face a deficit its best to get ready for it and prepare ahead
4373656 i remember being this age and sick and not having the energy to do anything
4373657 oh my god i have had like 20 blood draws already
4373658 a lot of them said they were glad they had crohns or colitis because it changed their perspective
4373659 it has made them who they are and brought them good things
4373660 it was the first time i felt empathy rather than sympathy from someone
4373661 it gives me the goose bumps to look at these guys playing hanging out laughing
4373662 after feeling like theyre the sickest kid in the world and they dont want to see anybody but their mom it makes me want to go back and experience what they are experiencing its just huge
4373663 six or eight bikes pull up in front of the precinct i saw some of the hells angels colors on the back they idled in front of the precinct for a few minutes nobody got off their bikes and then they left eastbound on virginia street
4373664 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4373665 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4373666 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4373667 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4373668 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4373669 to activate and step up the work of the joint committee on people missing from both countries
4373670 internationally speaking its a strategic nomination because he is pro european and he knows how brussels works
4373671 you could say a game here is worth two elsewhere but it is more than that
4373672 i want to challenge myself both in matches and in training every day and i want to improve my game
4373673 that is why i am here as long as the manager keeps me as part of the team that will do for me
4373674 at this club all you have to do is look across at ryan giggs and paul scholes and see the way they train
4373675 it is such an example they set despite the success they have had and the rewards they have received they still want more and more
4373676 you have to learn from these players and want to be like them that is what this place is all about
4373677 i remember seeing that and thinking i want to do that
4373678 i dont know what the statute of limitations on that stuff is
4373679 even the album title is a reference to graffiti its based on a lot of true stuff that happened when i was out there on the streets
4373680 even though i was listening to all of these artists i never felt i was really imitating anyones style
4373681 i feel like you could always really hear chicago in my music
4373682 ive been really surprised that people think its just a case of turning up and well beat stoke
4373683 thats not the case stoke will prove to everybody over the course of the season that theyre a really difficult opponent for everybody that they play
4373684 they come up with the momentum of being promoted theyve got some good players
4373685 there wont be a bigger fitter more organised team in the league than stoke and anybody who doesnt accept that will find themselves coming undone stoke city are not a mug team
4373686 weve known each other from when we were 16 hes a really good manager knows his stuff hes not always the most popular but not everybody always gets that right do they
4373687 hes always been successful but doesnt court publicity hes not one to tell everybody how wonderful he is hes a managers manager and knows his stuff
4373688 i can guarantee pulis will do us no favours on saturday and hell get none from ourselves
4373689 were typecast as this principled political band but the first impulse for being a band and continuing to be a band is the music we go into the rehearsal room to make new songs and we feel like we redefine the band every time thats exciting so how we measure success isnt about whether we have hits or were famous or accepted by the right people but about whether the music moves us
4373690 wed been listening to ethiopian music for years and terrie and i went over a few years ago because we wanted to make a plan to play there
4373691 we found a really old cassette of getatchews music in a market and we contacted him through his label and invited him to play with us at our 25th anniversary show four years ago it was fantastic it was his idea to get together and record it was a different tradition than he was used to but he loved the energy we have
4373692 its very hypnotic and it shares some similarities with rasta and asian music
4373693 its sweet but theres something snaky about the rhythms we feel at home playing this music because without realizing it we have a similar approach we create simple parts that interlock and build up to become quite complex and rich which is similar to the way ethiopian music works
4373694 he couldnt speak english with us so we did the whole thing in this kind of sign language laughing very vague body gestures but it somehow worked
4373695 he reminds me of some of the blues guys who resurfaced in the 60s
4373696 they disappeared after the depression and then they would reappear at carnegie hall its not quite the same for getatchew but its great that he gets this second chance to play he enjoys the fact that people at this late stage of his life appreciate his music it must be incredible to be 73 years old from ethiopia and discover that there are tens of thousands of people in a field in england who love your music
4373697 since it s our first time doing this we had no way of knowing if campers would utilize the market
4373698 a ton of campers have come back multiple times as well as fair visitors and people who live in sedalia looking for farm grown produce
4373699 all the campers have to do is give us their cell phone number and we meet them at the gate with their produce
4373700 its fun until youre actually doing it and then you have to go through all the pt physical training and stuff
4373701 involves an isolated situation that has been pestering us and other cities for quite some time
4373702 if the person hasnt been able to unify their own party it makes it hard to make the case to unify the country
4373703 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states
4373704 obamas people know that they have not closed the deal with hillary voters the way they would like and they just cant afford to do anything real or perceived that upsets mrs clinton and her followers
4373705 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4373706 die sendung wird vor allem mit viel spa zu tun haben wir haben ganz gezielt die klassischen probleme zwischen hund und herrchen rausgesucht und wollen sie mit einem augenzwinkern darstellen
4373707 mich reizt dass ich mich bei vox wirklich austoben kann es redet mir niemand bei der arbeit rein und ich kann einfach so sein wie ich bin
4373708 ich denke dass grunds tzlich ein hoher bedarf an coaching formaten da ist das thema hund und mensch ist ja eines das gesellschaftlich gesehen immer intensiver wird daher haben diese formate wenn sie nicht dogmatisch sondern mit spa dargestellt werden auch gro e erfolge
4373709 letztlich geht es immer um kommunikationsmissverst ndnisse es ist sehr h ufig so dass die menschen das verhalten eines hundes fehlinterpretieren was zu gro en problemen f hrt
4373710 das mit abstand am schwierigsten zu l sende problem ist das ph nomen angst wenn ich einen hund von seiner angst befreien will braucht er zu 100 prozent vertrauen zu seinen menschen und das braucht eine gewisse zeit wir haben auch so einen fall in der serie dass ein hund nicht auto fahren mag und spannenderweise geht er mit mir ohne probleme ins auto aber mit seinen haltern eben nicht
4373711 es gibt ganz gravierende unterschiede zwischen den hunderassen nehmen wir mal zwei extreme die menschen kaufen sich einen jack russel terrier und haben die hoffnung der hund solle mal etwas ruhe ausstrahlen das funktioniert nat rlich nicht das sind sehr temperamentvolle jagdpassionierte tendenziell aggressive hunde dann kommen die leute und haben einen berner sennenhund und sagen ich m chte aber einen hund mit ganz viel temperament und das sind gro e eher schlafm tzige gem tliche hunde
4373712 ich hatte immer eine gro e affinit t zu hunden und wusste schon fr h dass ich etwas mit hunden zu tun haben will dann habe ich ein jahr in australien verbracht und habe dort mit dingos gearbeitet australischen wildhunden danach war klar dass ich dazu beitragen m chte die missverst ndnisse zwischen hund und halter aufzukl ren es ist f r mich sehr frustrierend wie grob die leute mit ihren hunden umgehen
4373713 ja klar ich glaube dass lehrer in der schule auch sch ler haben die sie mehr und weniger m gen und das ist bei uns hundetrainern sicherlich auch so ich selber habe immer ein faible f r hunde die clever sind bei denen ich merke dass sie immer noch einen plan b in der tasche haben daf r habe ich eine absolute schw che
4373714 ich denke dass es da keinen geheimtrick oder kniff gibt dazu sind hunde viel zu individuell aber im vorfeld ein ganz wichtiger rat informieren sie sich bevor sie einen hund haben viele menschen kaufen sehr naiv und blau ugig einen hund und wissen eigentlich gar nicht was auf sie zu kommt untersch tzen den aufwand untersch tzen das temperament der hunde
4373715 ich w rde sogar noch einen schritt weitergehen ich w rde mir w nschen dass der staat endlich mal so etwas wie einen hundef hrerschein einf hrt denn viele z chter wissen absolut nicht was sie tun ein wochenendseminar w rde schon reichen um die ganz groben anf ngerfehler zu vermeiden
4373716 hunde die bellen bei en nicht kann man ausweiten im sinne von w hrend sie bellen k nnen sie nicht bei en doch direkt danach tun sie das manchmal
4373717 i am considerate of the environment but im doing it more for my own pocketbook
4373718 north dakota is the largest state in terms of carbon sequestration and program participation
4373719 whats happened in the last 40 50 years is that human activity has made the water quality conditions worse
4373720 tend to occur in areas that are historically prime fishing grounds
4373721 we can say that human activities really screwed up oxygen conditions in our coastal areas
4373722 the next big challenge after global warming is going to be addressing the massive upset of the worlds nitrogen cycle
4373723 there are large areas of the gulf where you cant catch any shrimp
4373724 the overwhelming response of the organisms in our coastal areas is to migrate or to die
4373725 to adapt to low oxygen water it has to be a part of your evolutionary history its not something you can develop in a 40 or 50 year time period
4373726 a step toward real security for poland in the future
4373727 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations
4373728 at this point it is hard to see why anyone would stick their neck out for general musharraf
4373729 compromised the objectivity necessary to dispassionately and fairly evaluate the evidence and prepare the post trial evaluation
4373730 really affects some of the high profile cases that gen hartmann has had his hands in
4373731 we are going to have to address those in court
4373732 for the first time she will be presented with a balanced portrait of the facts and circumstances in this case
4373733 it is my obligation my mission my duty to make sure the commissions move and work
4373734 if i may be so bold there was another president
4373735 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4373736 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4373737 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4373738 part of a strategic energy corridor affecting individual lives far beyond
4373739 we want to avoid any armed conflict and we will not have armed conflict
4373740 thats not the solution to this problem but we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days
4373741 you know i think he spends less time on his presidential campaign these days and lots of time on georgia
4373742 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years
4373743 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4373744 a higher incentive to stand with us now than they did before now that they have seen what the russians have done in georgia
4373745 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4373746 i entered politics so paraguay can stop being known to the world as the country of drug trafficking corruption and illegality
4373747 they havent even done public bidding for health supplies imagine taking power aug 15 and finding no medications or diesel fuel it is a country that could go up in flames within two or three months
4373748 i dont think he even thought hed become president much less us
4373749 will not sabotage fernando lugo nor create a climate of hostility during his term
4373750 the indigenous and the poor will be the privileged of my government
4373751 i pay homage to those tortured years ago to those persecuted and those who suffered unjustly
4373752 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4373753 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4373754 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4373755 its much more difficult than previous years when there were bigger motifs
4373756 this is the first baby step for christopher neil in terms of having him held accountable for the international sex crimes he is accused of committing
4373757 the world will be watching to see if there is the political will to continue on with this case
4373758 she sacrificed a lot for the olympics for me for the opening ceremony
4373759 for example there are performers who were injured i blame myself for that it might well have been avoided if i had given more detailed instructions
4373760 to make sure there is peace and stability in the region
4373761 the united states is committed toward securing a diplomatic resolution with iran on the nuclear issue
4373762 we want iran to play a responsible role in the region
4373763 there is not a clash of civilizations but its a clash of ignorance that all sides need to work on
4373764 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and suffering ive brought you
4373765 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness i ask the lord to forgive ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4373766 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4373767 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered
4373768 he was not a person of a lot of words but he did carry on conversations
4373769 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have crash equipment standing by in st louis
4373770 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4373771 when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues
4373772 i am not going to give up the dream of both koreas living well together
4373773 which is the source of distrust and conflict has to be eliminated completely
4373774 i have expectations that north korea will come forward for comprehensive dialogue and economic cooperation because now is the most opportune time for the north to make change
4373775 opening the age of the pacific and the age of eurasia simultaneously a unified korea will leap toward the center of the global community
4373776 i cant believe he did it this is amazing im so happy i can only jump up and down
4373777 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4373778 we are proud descendants of the great ghengis khan and tuvshee proved the strength of mongolians in the olympics
4373779 it is so exciting that our mongolian flag was raised in beijing and tuvshee won in the judo competition
4373780 me and several of my friends have bought mongolian vodka to celebrate this wonderful news it is going to be a very exciting night
4373781 there is no divide to the air that we all breathe or the clean water that we all depend on
4373782 there is no divide between our common desire to make the border region an economic powerhouse
4373783 whatever comes of all that ill continue to have peace
4373784 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are called according to his purpose
4373785 a lot of investors who have been buying commodities not just on a global growth story but as a hedge against a weak dollar are unloading those commodities based on a much more constrained global outlook and going back into the dollar
4373786 well have some people targeting 750 in gold but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
4373787 history shows a strong and consistent correlation between weak currencies and falling stock markets
4373788 weak currencies are a symptom of a deeper problem slowing economic growth out of control inflation or structural issues that reduce the attractiveness of equities
4373789 there is still a lot of feed through from extremely high commodity prices that have to get through to the economy around the world
4373790 we are still seeing some pretty high inflation numbers all over
4373791 avec lentourage du leader spirituel la secr taire detat aux droits de lhomme rama yade et son ministre de tutelle bernard kouchner ministre des affaires trang res
4373792 bernard kouchner a exprim le d sir de le rencontrer il nous a t l phon hier mercredi soir
4373793 god helps me forgive them but i dont like these jokes
4373794 religious education here indoctrinates fuelling prejudice against other faiths and against sexual minorities
4373795 some of my classmates push me outside the door before their religion class others ask me why am i not orthodox the same way the priest had asked my parents
4373796 but its more than this teaching children to discriminate against something builds a national mentality and in the end people reject differences and discriminate against everything
4373797 credibly asserted that authorities pressured children of other faiths to attend classes of orthodox religion
4373798 religious and sexual discrimination are not a problem of the schools as far as i know all religions say their god is the greatest and almost all disagree with homosexuality and we cant change peoples faiths
4373799 the values offered by religious education are needed desperately in times of aggressive and materialist individualism
4373800 cults seeking to introduce christ to the romanian people as if they havent known him for almost two millennia
4373801 romanian politicians have an instinctive fear of excommunication and they rarely oppose the views of the church
4373802 we are giving greece a reason to think that macedonia is opening new questions and that it wishes to block the negotiations
4373803 the most difficult thing was to answer their question where was god
4373804 most mothers here are tortured because they dont know what happened
4373805 we knew the kids were getting better when they started misbehaving
4373806 with united nations estimates as high as 100 000 people displaced by this conflict the time to help can no longer wait
4373807 people are escaping violence quite literally with only the clothes on their backs and in need of food and shelter
4373808 we have more than 60 years of experience helping the most vulnerable populations recover from conflict
4373809 as our partners in the region begin to grapple with the effects of this violence we stand ready to support them
4373810 those leaks continue to be evident because of the rain look at that spot and look at those spots over there
4373811 the assessment for the cafeteria was done on july 19 its already been one month
4373812 the leaks assessment is still needed or will be an ongoing process i cant comment any further on the leaks because dpw is the agency that has to get the engineers and contractors to come out and do another set of assessments
4373813 wisdom has built a house for herself and has set up seven pillars
4373814 wisdom has built a house for herself and has set up seven pillars
4373815 i have always believed that the name issue is solvable and that if we reach an agreement on the name it will open the way to solving many other issues
4373816 there are many issues between the two countries some of them are long term some are short term issues but i think both countries agree that the core issue is the name
4373817 there is a un resolution and an agreement between the two countries and my mandate is on the name issue
4373818 in the immediate vicinity of the solovetskii monastery and the graves of gulag victims song and jazz festivals are held
4373819 we have always aimed at full cooperation with the russian orthodox church and orthodox world we are a part of the orthodox world as one third of our electorate and allies are faithful believers no other political force in russia has such an orthodox nuclear
4373820 thus he summed up even when some representatives of clergy try to blackmail us we accept it with patience without offence or anger we are ready to convince our opponents both with good word and useful work that we have more in common than dividing and that all of us are children of russia and every of us on his place is ready to work for her welfare
4373821 the most important is to save national identity and a special role in it is given to protection of russian people who form the state which is impossible to do without historical mission of orthodoxy and the russian orthodox church
4373822 the first blah blah 4 game sweep in x years
4373823 he has been enrolling students for direct courses with the university without remitting the money to the main campus
4373824 when prof kateregga got to know that he fr lubega was fraudulently running an institution in jinja he complained to us
4373825 for those who believe in god no explanation is necessary for those who do not believe in god no explanation is possible
4373826 ghost train to the eastern star on the tracks of the great railway bazaar
4373827 ghost train to the eastern star on the tracks of the great railway bazaar
4373828 one of the most easily negotiated and hospitable cities in the world
4373829 only the old can really see how gracelessly the world is aging and all that we have lost
4373830 in gori we have two church congregations who are very involved in looking after the poor and destitute but they have had to leave the city and hide in the rural villages and hope the russian bombers do not find them there in the peace cathedral in tbilisi we have a 24 hour prayer circle praying for a peaceful resolution for the conflict
4373831 this time this conflict has been started by a third party that is russia there is a sense of powerlessness and help lessness because there is little we can do except pray that is very important
4373832 these bonds are both of a theological spiritual nature and also involve engagement in a number of social projects
4373833 the use of force has cost the precious lives of civilians and soldiers risks destabilizing a fragile region and reawakens deep fears there and far beyond

4373835 the emmy nominated producer of the hbo documentary born rich and the author of fierce people for which he wrote the screenplay
4373836 youd think one of my children would listen to me when i give them advice
4373837 you must remember i was born into this system it was all i knew i did not know a gentile until i was an adult woman i had been told the world beyond deseret was babylon and sodom combined i had been raised to believe brigham delivered messages from god and above all i was told this was my spiritual duty and that if i wanted to enter heaven and who among us miss lee does not then i would need to submit to brighams command and become a plural wife
4373838 on behalf of redkite and nsw racehorse owners association i would like to thank everyone for attending this very special event which showcases the very best of the nsw thoroughbred industry
4373839 when i turn on the tv and i see a half hour of network news followed by two half hour programs of entertainment news im going like wow you could die of starvation here if you were actually looking for some facts about the world
4373840 its about husband and wife gossip columnists who basically bicker have fun laugh a lot and drink cocktails
4373841 so why did the democratic party just strike out all references to gay families from its presidential election platform
4373842 and its still way easier to play gay in hollywood if youre straight
4373843 when i was writing the film to wong foo thanks for everything julie newmar an actor under consideration was dismissed for being too effeminate too effeminate to play a drag queen
4373844 theyd say thats so odd that you got nominated because the play is a comedy
4373845 and i said thats what i do and for many years that was the bread and butter of the american theater comedies about the foibles of the day eccentric families married guys having affairs all that stuff
4373846 you go to these meetings with network executives and they keep asking for changes to make your ideas a little safer a little less painful a little more bland i just cant do it anymore
4373847 the power of place geography destiny and globalizations rough landscape
4373848 extrapolate these circumstances to the availability of medical services on the two sides and it is clear that even on the doorstep of the global core the medical landscape is anything but flat

4373861 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
4373862 asking questions of presidents has always been a huge responsibility
4373863 she feels that if she doesnt ask the question it wont get asked
4373864 her parents couldnt read or write and here is this woman who moved to washington where she didnt know anybody and made a life for herself
4373865 empathizing with his problems and concerns such as the fact that his feet hurt i also fed him some cupcakes which he enjoyed
4373866 they had such a great time and when they realized they could make money for charities they did it on a regular basis
4373867 he told me not to come over that he had a gun
4373868 said it was all true except the part about the gun
4373869 if i was wrong about the gun what else was i wrong about

4373872 we are working with the airlines to rectify this problem we sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers

4373880 different possibilities that could develop in the area and the region
4373881 largely the violence has died down over the last 24 hours
4373882 the report which specifically addressed speculation appears to have been created and released to influence that senate vote which would be highly improper in our view
4373883 does not support the proposition that speculative activity has systematically driven changes in oil prices
4373884 we are greatly disturbed that although cftc staff obviously knew that underlying data used to prepare the interim report was seriously flawed the interim report was nonetheless publicly released
4373885 why it was released after the cftc staff had determined that critical information upon which it was based was inaccurate
4373886 in light of the recent increases in energy prices and the resulting concerns of the public and policy makers
4373887 the campaign did not pledge any federal matching funds certifications as collateral for a bank loan
4373888 youll see a campaign that is better at staying on message
4373889 our problem is to keep these interactions to a manageable point
4373890 but what were learning is that once you become the nominee every word is seized upon
4373891 his day is more structured focused on getting the message out
4373892 while people are paying 3 75 a gallon for gas
4373893 what you have to realize is that this is a marathon
4373894 i think john would do a town hall meeting that would last for days
4373895 john dont wear yourself out make sure your message resonates visually
4373896 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4373897 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4373898 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4373899 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time

4373902 the governments criminal case against senator stevens is not based on his legislative activities but on his receipt of financial benefits and his need to conceal those benefits from public scrutiny
4373903 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4373904 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4373905 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4373906 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4373907 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds

4373928 we are setting the bar high because we know the county will rally around its survivors and those who are battling cancer right now

4373939 theres so many different things to do on this campus
4373940 charlotte high school is a community its a culture its a way of life you now have the opportunity to experience that way of life so get involved
4373941 were just trying to put them through everything we can today in order to relieve them of the anxiety of that first day of school
4373942 im ready for high school and to see what its like
4373943 im going to check it all out and see what i like
4373944 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4373945 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4373946 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4373947 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4373948 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4373949 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans
4373950 a divine madness poisoned his mind tainting his name during the night

4373952 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for a pre christmas test match
4373953 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4373954 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4373955 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4373956 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4373957 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4373958 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4373959 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4373960 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control and it would ratify their continuing engagement with the military force until everything is worked out but it doesnt say that the forces will be replaced
4373961 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4373962 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4373963 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4373964 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4373965 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4373966 this is not good at all because companies facing the crunch may not get help from the banks that are supposed to be helping out
4373967 because of the times we are in when companies approach bankers they would have to come with a clear convincing case
4373968 this is not good because it may affect the sustainability of some companies particularly smaller enterprises it would also prevent other small entrants from entering the world of business
4373969 we may request more collateral when lending or maintain a higher level of surveillance if they are a current customer
4373970 but there are no sectors we would currently not do business with
4373971 we are at this time most comfortable with those sectors exposed to government initiatives such as construction and other non cyclical industries
4373972 we also look at customer relationship and risk we also take into account profitability
4373973 the purpose of the sector focus is not aimed at supporting one sector over another but to provide a more tailored service and financial offering
4373974 he was one of the first black guys to have a new car
4373975 we were just like a family he was a very good family man he took care of his family and his children and he was a workingman
4373976 we had a happy life the four years we were together
4373977 we liked to go out and eat you know and we liked to just ride around in the car
4373978 any time you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
4373979 am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
4373980 its like youre trying to crank the car up a bit more every week
4373981 weve given up a couple long drives carolina didnt score this time pittsburgh was able to score on theirs so we just have to make sure we dont give up those long drives and get off the field bring it out and get some turnovers too
4373982 there is no closed circulation yet but a depression could form any time
4373983 the upper level winds are becoming more favorable for development
4373984 the models of possible paths are a bit divergent right now
4373985 three men have been arrested on suspicion of committing terror offences police say two of the men were held at manchester airport while the third was detained in nearby accrington lancashire police said the men aged 21 22 and 23 were all from the blackburn area their homes are being searched by specialist officers
4373986 most companies align with the olympics because they hope to borrow equity or transfer goodwill from that of the olympics to their own brands
4373987 twenty years ago it was a slam dunk mcdonalds and coca cola measured noticeable lifts in preference favorability and attitudes toward the brand during the co brand window of the games
4373988 1984 was the turning point however the los angeles games in some ways reinvented the sponsorship model so much so that la had a surplus of funds after the games it was so successful that more brands wanted in
4373989 today sponsors have changed quite a bit there are more of them and the affiliation competes with branded partnerships in vastly more channels and platforms
4373990 the olympic equity is still strong although research shows that it is the strongest when the games are actually in progress but its harder to transfer or borrow the equity
4373991 false reporting of unaided awareness of olympic sponsorships is on the rise meaning consumers attribute an olympic sponsorship to the wrong company and ambush tactics by other marketers are more prolific
4373992 it still works for some we expect adidas coca cola and mcdonalds will still do well part of that is the legacy in adidas case its the innovative way theyve gone to market
4373993 we do think the olympics is a horrible place to debut new brands however there is too much clutter and competition
4373994 it can be an effective place to reposition a brand particularly if the brand is in the b2b space and the repositioning can occur onsite at the events many of the attendees of olympic events are executives just like the super bowl ups is using the beijing games as an interesting venue to debut some of their new international brand activity
4373995 until china never before has the market potential of the host country on its own been viewed as possibly worth the significant investment despite the degree of controversy before the games began the market opportunity seems irresistible
4373996 the china brand today is often correlated with low quality products so the challenge is herculean with the world watching their every step success in beijing will send a strong new message about china as a world power if it missteps it will not soon have such visibility to transform a lagging image
4373997 its safe to assume americans understand that olympic sponsorship is not the same as supporting chinas political policies that said given the ongoing buzz and interest in how china enters the world stage how a brand behaves in and or partners with china may draw more attention in the future from international media thus elevating the potential for a negative effect on a brands image this may be more of a concern for b2b organizations that deal more closely with the chinese government or in government monitored sectors
4373998 this is the first baby step for christopher neil in terms of having him held accountable for the international sex crimes he is accused of committing
4373999 the world will be watching to see if there is the political will to continue on with this case
4374000 when theyre in their rooms reading is their main activity
4374001 reading in spanish helps with the transition to reading in english for native spanish speakers

4374005 the problem with michael phelps is theres no competition where he is
4374006 another section of the beijing olympics opening ceremony has been exposed as faked the children supposedly representing the countrys 56 ethnic groups were in fact all from the same one the majority han chinese race
4374007 these agreements will make san luis obispo county an instant leader in renewable energy
4374008 ive asked all of them to start talking to each other and look at cumulative impacts
4374009 dont just look at your own project look beyond that
4374010 i want the issues of the impact on agriculture and well as the biology issues thoroughly assessed
4374011 the increased costs could have been extra spending money like a movie or a dinner people want that back
4374012 prices are still high enough and higher prices so recent that trends wont reverse soon
4374013 that means people are motivated to take buses on longer trips
4374014 people are standing on the bus in the middle of the day sometimes
4374015 any car that is 17 000 or less that gets at least 35 miles per gallon spends about a day here and thats it
4374016 we had 75 civics on our lot in may and within 40 days all 75 cars were gone
4374017 as soon as gas hit 4 people said thats it im looking for alternative transportation
4374018 while there is no substantial growth in that area it is important to note that the overall student population is declining by about 1 percentage point each year and english language learners are growing
4374019 i think we are doing a really good job of moving students into the proficient and advanced categories under those circumstances
4374020 that attention to detail is now being shown in the test scores
4374021 these are some of the most difficult cases for analysis in terms of filing because there are cases that are accidents there are cases we havent filed because it could be more of a civil wrong but it doesnt rise to the level of criminal negligence
4374022 wir haben gute argumente die einige spieler berzeugen und deshalb bin ich nicht hoffnungslos was die n chsten tage angeht
4374023 das sterreichische bundesheer bietet ja nicht nur eine milit rische laufbahn sondern bernimmt nach der dienstzeit beim bundesheer auch die aus und weiterbildungskosten bis hin zu akademischen ausbildungslehrg ngen eben ganz nach dem motto eine entscheidung viele chancen ich ermuntere im besonderen all jene die gerade vor entscheidungen ber ihre berufliche zukunft stehen sich pers nlich ber diese beruflichen chancen beim sterreichischen bundesheer zu informieren
4374024 i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
4374025 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
4374026 im happy theyre doing it but i know that it will be gone after november
4374027 its important for our viewers to be able to see both sides

4374042 i felt empowerment and rage and despondency even giddiness and self abuse i ran the gamut
4374043 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers have canceled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals
4374044 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
4374045 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4374046 we certainly respect mr rushdies opinion but we stand by our decision which we made with considerable deliberation and regret
4374047 not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4374048 larry and i will have a bowl of mueslix and a small shot of prune juice and be in bed by 9 oclock

4374070 if im a neat freak and youre a slob how are we going to make this work
4374071 it can show how much one person is projecting onto the other versus how each person really is
4374072 in his years of working with couples my father saw that the test was a quick efficient way to capture a picture of their strengths and their possible problems
4374073 showing a couple the results of the test was like showing them an x ray
4374074 in the test publishing field mr taylors work is widely respected
4374075 his pride in his work and belief in what he was doing was impressive
4374076 today we would classify their problem as post traumatic stress
4374077 archie is who you wish you were but arent kids really believe archie lives because they call here and ask to speak to archie
4374078 servicemen wrote us during world war ii that they dove into a foxhole during battle and when the smoke cleared they found an archie comic at the bottom of the foxhole and they sat there and read it because it reminded them of back home
4374079 silberkleit was determined to keep archie an american institution pure as childhood yet up to date for generations archie and the gang have represented the wonder and magic of childhood and silberkleit fought successfully to keep this vision alive
4374080 he was going for gold but i wasnt with him

4374083 to curtail their stay in china and leave the country earlier
4374084 maybe abroad you dont understand this issue tibet is an inalienable part of chinese territory some there want a split and this is not good
4374085 i notice that most of the people in these demonstrations are non chinese so they dont understand i dont think the media should encourage this the olympics are where you come to make friends and understand each other only with this can we resolve issues and not stir up trouble
4374086 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
4374087 treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4374088 bzzbzzbzz whats that im sorry youre breaking up i must be in a tunnel or something can you call back later
4374089 here at opus dei despite all the rumors we are much less interested in the sewing of painful spikes into the insides of your underwear and far more interested in leveraged buyouts and carefully planned upticks in shareholder valuation
4374090 in other words what people dont know is we turn our adherents into devout hard nosed businesspersons placing them in the highest positions of power in large corporations where they toil deep into the night in the name of jesus preparing briefings and presentations and financial reports
4374091 naturally turning anyone into a cold corporate drone in the name of god quickly defeats all sexual urges as it effortlessly annihilates the soul and replaces it with this chalky gray powder that looks like scorched flowers and tastes like sadness
4374092 dude dont get me wrong maiden is completely awesome and old motorhead blows my mind hell even early def leppard totally rocks but there is simply no comparison to the masters of all british metal you know
4374093 i mean have you heard hell bent for leather lately or screaming for vengeance and the notes halford hits on beyond the realms of death from stained class way back in 78 are positively epic
4374094 throw your thesaurus away you have nothing to lose but your pneumatic pulchritudinous manacles remember the better it looks on paper the worse its going to sound on film
4374095 violence including sexual violence remains an everyday threat for women and girls
4374096 most of women and girls were raped by family members and friends
4374097 the question is why does thai society still ignore violence against women the ignorance about violence against women in society is a kind of violence itself
4374098 school funding is paid for by the residents taxes in that school district so families who live in an area such as palos are going to have better school funding because we essentially are paying more have less children in said school district and less overhead and corruption so basically if you pay less into a system you get less out of it
4374099 they came in a group as ordinary citizens and purchased tickets
4374100 i dont know why such a hullabaloo is being made about it they told me their program is for mondays and had come today just to see the taj mahal
4374101 the people who are being registered as members of sdcs are mostly illiterate and there is every possibility that these people can misuse the weapons for their personal grudges or animosities this can result in civil war in the area
4374102 to give people weapons like this will derail the centuries existing peace tranquility and brotherhood in the area
4374103 with so much worry and concern for their family and friends
4374104 it was a brave and courageous act for the company to perform
4374105 discussing the growth of video production and how it is useful outside the scope of films and tv for a variety of purposes such as training videos safety videos promotional videos videos for investors and the list goes on
4374106 as the manager of the team there were two fundamental responsibilities
4374107 one was to win the game and the second was just as important to get everyone home safely
4374108 there is no easy answer we knew the game was going to be played to its completion
4374109 he has a brand new pitch that he didnt have and its good
4374110 i think everyone in the bullpen was hurt its saying we cant do our jobs
4374111 i heard the red wings put in a claim on me
4374112 you see a happy vacation spot we can send people to
4374113 i dont so well have to do the best we can
4374114 combler mes 3 croix et jai repositionn les 2 d cos de droite sinon je devais tout d faire et a ce n tait pas possible mdr
4374115 we feel confident were doing excellent work and wed like to not have that hanging over our head
4374116 but we just need to keep focused on what our task is even though weve improved its still not acceptable that only 35 of fifth graders are reading proficiently
4374117 for the sixth year in a row california students are continuing to make solid steady progress
4374118 we still have a lot of work to do to reach our goal of universal proficiency but this years gains are particularly encouraging
4374119 l a s future depends on our citizens to adopt an ethic of conservation
4374120 hes talked to me about resigning more than a few times each time i get him to realize that we need him
4374121 if residents are being asked not to water their lawns between 9 and 4 shouldnt the city follow the same policy
4374122 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4374123 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4374124 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4374125 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4374126 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4374127 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4374128 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4374129 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4374130 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4374131 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4374132 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4374133 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4374134 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4374135 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4374136 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4374137 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control and it would ratify their continuing engagement with the military force until everything is worked out but it doesnt say that the forces will be replaced
4374138 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4374139 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4374140 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4374141 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4374142 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4374143 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4374144 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4374145 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4374146 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4374147 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4374148 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4374149 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4374150 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4374151 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4374152 otherwise people would begin to call into question his ability to run the country and accuse him of being spineless
4374153 the political process can always be looked at either through a telescope or a microscope
4374154 if you look up close of course much is changing but if you take the longer view it turns out that the system was totalitarian and continues to be totalitarian
4374155 the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4374156 you can argue that it was the highlight of his career he had been treading water for eight or 10 years
4374157 he said he was fearful of doing television because aside from the ed sullivan exposure television had been a fiasco for him
4374158 wed start shooting at 9 or 10 in the morning and go until we were done then hed go into his living quarters and invite friends and theyd jam to all hours of the morning
4374159 i was amazed by all the energy enthusiasm and fun going on after a hard days work
4374160 there was no plan at all i mean absolutely nothing
4374161 he didnt know what he was going to do i knew he was going to pull out some of the old songs wed done that kind of thing but that was it
4374162 this is supposed to be the informal part of the show where we faint or do whatever we want to do especially me
4374163 because he hadnt been touring he had gotten into the movie thing i know his feeling was im getting back before the public this way
4374164 the fact that he wasnt controlled wasnt reading prepared lines it was raw and it was powerful and i think it was who he really was
4374165 shes become an adjective friends will go shopping with each other and say its so madonna thats what you want in fashion
4374166 i dont love all her looks but can appreciate them all
4374167 shes always operated from a position thats a good hybrid of contemporary pop culture the psyche of the nation but also an artistic slant and art always pushes the envelope
4374168 youre looking at the total picture with your team going forward and considering how much better can it get the way it is vs what is the potential to get better by doing something different
4374169 you know if you have a big shade tree then shade is good to a point
4374170 but if theres too much shade then the grass doesnt get to grow
4374171 we have seven or eight core veterans who are really good pieces we have this young group here behind them starting in october training camp well see what it looks like
4374172 we felt he was really a top 20 talent going in
4374173 he played really well over the las vegas summer league and adds another exciting skillful player to our team that we can go forward with
4374174 being able to acquire another young talent with size and skill who should be a natural small forward in the league along with a veteran like bobby and not sacrifice any real future salary cap flexibility that starts to become attractive to you
4374175 but we continued to talk and we always felt like ron was a player that if we could acquire for the right pieces would as were talking about today add a significant upgrade
4374176 it was built by a gentleman who around the turn of the century designed a seal that was used for ford motor cars
4374177 we invested and stood behind ron both professionally and personally
4374178 i will be the first to admit that in the beginning he didnt pay enough attention to his housing situation with the dogs
4374179 but he changed he cared he did everything we suggested and more and thats all anyone can ask
4374180 one of my good friends works at the spca in houston and ive already talked to ron and suggested he continue his work down there again he was very receptive
4374181 things move very quickly in football you never know what might happen it could be something that is revisted
4374182 were in the market we were a little bit light in some areas and we were missing some key players i just thought we needed to be more positive with a bit more drive
4374183 we had a problem in the first half with too many unforced errors i told the players we had to play more in their half and dont allow ourselves to get trapped
4374184 in the second half they were comfortable and knew how to play on the counter attack
4374185 specifically to hurt her to make her feel a small fragment of what his mother must have been feeling
4374186 saw danger in the eyes of strangers on the street
4374187 humor became horror if you let it spin around in your head too much
4374188 the gasping for breath and the flutter of the eyes as they twitched open
4374189 paid auto surf program a common term for modern ponzi schemes
4374190 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them

4374193 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have canceled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals
4374194 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
4374195 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4374196 we certainly respect mr rushdies opinion but we stand by our decision which we made with considerable deliberation and regret
4374197 we have to ask you out of respect for the nature of the event
4374198 and the intersection of the law and stories the law is fundamentally about how we tell our stories
4374199 although in the law there has to be an answer its an absolute world
4374200 but probably everyone we talked to would agree that they dont want to live in fear or constant worry
4374201 we didnt have too many people who didnt want to talk
4374202 they were excited to be part of the series which aims to expose human rights issues
4374203 voices from the storm the people of new orleans on hurricane katrina and its aftermath
4374204 out of exile narratives from the abducted and displaced people of sudan
4374205 oh it cant possibly be that bad in their country

4374207 ok this piece needs to be mostly green on top and white below and it has a black squiggly thing on the left hand side
4374208 i feel my calling is to the entertainment world once again
4374209 resurge my status as truly a bay area celebrity and basically exploit me in a good way to the best of her his ability
4374210 she likes her dresses a little tight she wants to be sexy she has a sense of whats good for her

4374214 the medfly is a pest that poses a serious threat to california agriculture
4374215 i would like to thank the residents and growers who helped us eradicate these infestations by cooperating with the three quarantines

4374218 ive lost a friend i was drinking with how can i go home now
4374219 we were exploring soweto for venue options but it would be a logistical disaster to have the dinner there
4374220 there are people who have wanted to meet and talk to jeff radebe for two years and now they can network with him
4374221 i think i will hug the prince he has always been a great fan of me
4374222 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4374223 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4374224 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4374225 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4374226 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4374227 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4374228 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4374229 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4374230 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4374231 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4374232 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4374233 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4374234 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4374235 the birds eat the seeds they get dropped in the woods and theres burning bush everywhere people love its red color in the fall but it just shouldnt be sold
4374236 birds still come to the city and take seeds to parks they dont know they arent supposed to do that
4374237 just because a plant is from somewhere else doesnt automatically mean its a problem
4374238 there are plenty of exotic species that are well behaved in the garden
4374239 it really does boil down to on the individual level how much of an impact is this making
4374240 we tag something as invasive when its a tremendous pain
4374241 quite a few of the gardeners i interact with are passionate about wildlife gardening but theyre not necessarily botanists
4374242 theyll start calling things that are vigorous invasive theyre not invasive theyre just aggressive
4374243 now it wants to be everywhere and a lot of my other plants are getting crowded out
4374244 im weeding out this beautiful native wildflower that i love because its so aggressive
4374245 i tell students whats native at the bottom of mount nittany isnt native at the top you change elevation and whats native changes
4374246 so many of the things we pull our hair out over somebody brought over on purpose
4374247 it was this curious plant from asia and the idea was hey this will grow anywhere
4374248 in the industrial revolution we can grow this in these dirty smog laden cities in stuff that isnt even soil
4374249 look at the species of concern that are out there and to try and pull those and work those plants out of production
4374250 some places out there that dont care and still some plants in the trade that are problematic
4374251 the u s department of energy said yesterday that oil demand in that country recorded the biggest drop in 26 years in the first half of 2008 falling by an average of 800 000 barrels a day from the same period a year ago for the worlds biggest energy user it was the steepest decline since consumption tumbled during a recession in the early 1980s the international energy agency iea meanwhile confirmed that the u s consumer is starting to shun travel in an effort to cut costs the iea now expects a combination of high crude prices and a slowing economy will lead to a 3 1 per cent decline in u s oil demand this year followed by a 2 per cent drop in 2009
4374252 last weeks inventory report released wednesday aug 6 estimated that oil consumption during the four week period ending aug 1 fell 20 1 million barrels or 2 6 relative to the same period in 2007 consumption for the week ending aug 1 was said to have dropped 4 1 year on year

4374263 i just want to find out whether he can get better at his age
4374264 we are seeing things unfold at the moment you are seeing olympians at 30 plus years of age winning goals medals im not sure why our game is any different
4374265 i want to talk to him about whether he thinks he can get better from here on end
4374266 james hird won a best and fairest at 34 and i think shane crawford and matthew richardson and these sorts of guys are having great seasons at their age and they are two or three years older than him
4374267 it comes down to pride preparation fitness discipline all that
4374268 they are very hard to find the types of players like jeff
4374269 i dont want to make a premature decision on him
4374270 you have been found not guilty you are discharged from these proceedings and you are free to go
4374271 you should not have any second thoughts about your decision
4374272 you will never be better informed than you are at this moment
4374273 this club you are talking about obviously it is a heritage thing
4374274 the sanfl has played a big part in my life the three clubs i have played with in particular norwood where i started
4374275 so the short answer is just a strong emotional attachment i have to this club in particular the way it was formed what it represents you know its a representation of the 10 clubs at the time of sanfl footy
4374276 i was lucky enough to play for a long time in the sanfl play state footy for the sanfl so it is purely a personal very much a personal individual point of view
4374277 im not saying it is right probably only right for me its just the way i feel about sa footy and if i can put something back into it for this club only that would do me
4374278 the good thing about this year is weve bonded really well especially the young guys coming through and the mateship between us is really strong and you can see it in the way were playing
4374279 eliminate many of the inconsistencies that existed in the system over the first three years of the a league
4374280 the regulations were reviewed because we wanted to ensure that footballs disciplinary provisions are not only consistent with those of the sport internationally but also with community expectations within australia
4374281 russias blatant violation of the long respected olympic truce should be enough for the ioc to join with us in choosing a more worthy venue
4374282 russias belligerence against the people of georgia and their democratically elected government cannot go unpunished
4374283 move immediately to designate a new host city for the 2014 winter olympic games
4374284 the failure of the government of the russian federation to respect the sovereignty and territorial borders of its neighbours has rendered the country an unacceptable host for the 2014 winter olympic games
4374285 they are announcing it today in order to draw attention to it over the next few weeks
4374286 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles 32km from a zone of conflict particularly when the host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4374287 the international olympic committee would not have selected sochi as the host city for the 2014 winter olympic games if its members had anticipated that the russian federation would invade the republic of georgia
4374288 whilst we are aware of the story regarding the intended resolution by us congressmen only the ioc can respond on such matters
4374289 they have sole and independent responsibility for all matters concerning the location and hosting of the olympic winter games
4374290 all our efforts here in china are spent on learning from these wonderful beijing games so that we can enhance our offering for the olympic movement
4374291 at sochi 2014 our focus is to deliver an excellent and innovative games that will inspire the world we are on track to achieve this
4374292 i am sure there will be a bit of ribbing at home after this
4374293 three medals for one family at the olympics is phenomenal i could not be happier
4374294 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4374295 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4374296 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people
4374297 this army travels around with irregulars travels around with marauders travels around with rapists travels around with arsonists robbers and with looters
4374298 residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain
4374299 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4374300 we know its a hard task to play sydney at any time and to play them at their home state is another challenge but i think thats exactly what we need at the moment
4374301 we are playing a very hard contested football team tomorrow night and that in itself is a very very good thing
4374302 we look forward to that because thats the sort of thing finals are made of and we probably expect that sort of thing tomorrow night
4374303 to be honest you would rather play sydney than a team lower on the ladder because its better practice going into the final series
4374304 at the moment were a team that has a few players in and out and its probably hard to get some consistency
4374305 i think in tomorrow nights team you get nic fosdike back malceski back obviously goodes last week and jared crouch so we are probably a little bit more experienced at this time of year
4374306 weve been pretty competitive against them but we havent been able to play 120 minutes of good footy
4374307 thats really our main focus to try to be competitive for longer and hopefully in front of them at the end of the game
4374308 id like to play in the first one i think its still a possibility but i havent run yet
4374309 i dont think contact work will be an issue its just whether it swells up or i can actually run properly thats the big one
4374310 its one of those things ive been used to for a long time now playing off the bench
4374311 ive been ready for test football for the last eight weeks so if the opportunity was going to come up earlier on i wouldve been ready and im ready this week
4374312 everyone suffers their fair share of injuries ive not been excluded from that but its one of those things and he burgess will be back at some stage
4374313 the opportunity is there for myself to press for another start

4374329 i was lucky enough to play for a long time in the sanfl play state footy for the sanfl so it is purely a personal very much a personal individual point of view
4374330 im not saying it is right probably only right for me its just the way i feel about sa footy and if i can put something back into it for this club only that would do me
4374331 the good thing about this year is weve bonded really well especially the young guys coming through and the mateship between us is really strong and you can see it in the way were playing
4374332 hopefully we can keep that and make that really strong for the future it really helps i believe
4374333 i have gained nothing but just brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4374334 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4374335 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats
4374336 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4374337 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey
4374338 our police family suffered a devastating loss through aubreys ultimate sacrifice
4374339 its not like theres one person involved there are six
4374340 we know its a hard task to play sydney at any time and to play them at their home state is another challenge but i think thats exactly what we need at the moment
4374341 we are playing a very hard contested football team tomorrow night and that in itself is a very very good thing
4374342 we look forward to that because thats the sort of thing finals are made of and we probably expect that sort of thing tomorrow night
4374343 to be honest you would rather play sydney than a team lower on the ladder because its better practice going into the final series
4374344 at the moment were a team that has a few players in and out and its probably hard to get some consistency
4374345 i think in tomorrow nights team you get nic fosdike back malceski back obviously goodes last week and jared crouch so we are probably a little bit more experienced at this time of year
4374346 weve been pretty competitive against them but we havent been able to play 120 minutes of good footy
4374347 thats really our main focus to try to be competitive for longer and hopefully in front of them at the end of the game
4374348 i had the knee injury which dragged on and then i had a hamstring injury
4374349 id like to play in the first one i think its still a possibility but i havent run yet
4374350 i dont think contact work will be an issue its just whether it swells up or i can actually run properly thats the big one
4374351 its one of those things ive been used to for a long time now playing off the bench
4374352 ive been ready for test football for the last eight weeks so if the opportunity was going to come up earlier on i wouldve been ready and im ready this week
4374353 everyone suffers their fair share of injuries ive not been excluded from that but its one of those things and he burgess will be back at some stage
4374354 the opportunity is there for myself to press for another start to try and play out the tri nations in a number nine jersey is something i would love to do
4374355 particularly being my last season with the wallabies it would be a great way to finish off
4374356 this army travels around with irregulars travels around with marauders travels around with rapists travels around with arsonists robbers and with looters
4374357 residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain
4374358 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4374359 i am sure there will be a bit of ribbing at home after this
4374360 three medals for one family at the olympics is phenomenal i could not be happier
4374361 russias blatant violation of the long respected olympic truce should be enough for the ioc to join with us in choosing a more worthy venue
4374362 russias belligerence against the people of georgia and their democratically elected government cannot go unpunished
4374363 move immediately to designate a new host city for the 2014 winter olympic games
4374364 the failure of the government of the russian federation to respect the sovereignty and territorial borders of its neighbours has rendered the country an unacceptable host for the 2014 winter olympic games
4374365 they are announcing it today in order to draw attention to it over the next few weeks
4374366 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles 32km from a zone of conflict particularly when the host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4374367 the international olympic committee would not have selected sochi as the host city for the 2014 winter olympic games if its members had anticipated that the russian federation would invade the republic of georgia
4374368 whilst we are aware of the story regarding the intended resolution by us congressmen only the ioc can respond on such matters
4374369 they have sole and independent responsibility for all matters concerning the location and hosting of the olympic winter games
4374370 all our efforts here in china are spent on learning from these wonderful beijing games so that we can enhance our offering for the olympic movement
4374371 at sochi 2014 our focus is to deliver an excellent and innovative games that will inspire the world we are on track to achieve this
4374372 fuelling and financing drug syndicates after the afp seized 662 kilograms of pseudoephedrine worth 52 8 million
4374373 the last five weeks has seen law enforcement in australia at its most effective in dealing with the threat of drugs mr carmody said
4374374 it would appear our market here in australia is prepared to pay a premium for this sort of narcotic he said
4374375 the data suggests that with the average monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 33 924 a year median first home prices wont be staying at current levels for much longer
4374376 those wishing to find a buyer from this market will have to lower their price
4374377 obama will work tirelessly to uphold this nations sacred trust with its veterans to ensure they are not forgotten after they return home and he will provide our troops with the leadership they deserve as well as the support they and their families need
4374378 john mccain has been endorsed by more retired admirals and generals than barack obama has military donors
4374379 we feel confident that many u s troops stationed overseas will support john mccain in the election this fall but we suspect most are too busy doing the important work of defending this country than to make political contributions
4374380 i think sen gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador to belarus although im not sure the citizens of minsk would welcome that
4374381 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4374382 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states
4374383 obamas people know that they have not closed the deal with hillary voters the way they would like and they just cant afford to do anything real or perceived that upsets mrs clinton and her followers so they have more than bent over to accommodate her
4374384 you do worry and i think that was something that concerned her as well
4374385 what is the turnout going to be is anyone coming to my party
4374386 she sought to be the first woman nominated for president she came up a little short but she made it easier for the next female candidate to get the brass ring many in the democratic party would like to celebrate that i think that they should celebrate that
4374387 its a reassertion of the age old russian ambitions and desires for the russian empire and the so called near abroad
4374388 i really hesitate to talk about a military option at this time because i think that would escalate rather than de escalate what we want to see achieved here
4374389 theres plenty of time in the future depending on russias behavior there and in the region to talk about the other options
4374390 i think he used the issue of iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party
4374391 a lot of my taste in music stopped about the time i impacted a surface to air missile with my own airplane and never caught up again
4374392 now look everyone says i hate abba abba how terrible blah blah blah how come everybody goes to mamma mia everybody goes theyve been selling out for years
4374393 prominent supporters and high level campaign officials are having private campaign meetings in aspen tomorrow
4374394 and i was hoping it would be enough at that point
4374395 i didnt think whether i was going to make it or not but how i was going to make it
4374396 ask me on another day or if i hadnt won
4374397 i just want to find out whether he can get better at his age
4374398 we are seeing things unfold at the moment you are seeing olympians at 30 plus years of age winning goals medals im not sure why our game is any different
4374399 i want to talk to him about whether he thinks he can get better from here on end
4374400 james hird won a best and fairest at 34 and i think shane crawford and matthew richardson and these sorts of guys are having great seasons at their age and they are two or three years older than him
4374401 it comes down to pride preparation fitness discipline all that
4374402 they are very hard to find the types of players like jeff
4374403 i dont want to make a premature decision on him
4374404 the wizard is an extraordinary player because he knows how to play the game like not many other players do know how to play the game
4374405 the cost of the damage is shaping up to be between 50m and 100m
4374406 it is very early to say but it does seem that the claims are likely to be substantial it is very harrowing for the people concerned but there is also likely to be an increase in premiums for everyone
4374407 this legislation will put an end to a system that forces medically vulnerable patients including psychiatric patients to pay two and one half times more out of pocket costs for mental health services than for any other service under medicare part b
4374408 we could not have arrived at this extraordinary moment without the coordinated efforts of our dedicated members our devoted and skilled staff and the efforts of those legislators who were unwilling to tolerate this unacceptable discrimination
4374409 elderly people are particularly vulnerable with respect to depression anxiety and alcohol use problems each of which can be treated on an outpatient basis
4374410 this fixes significant problems in the medicare program this bill will allow patients easier access to psychiatrists and treatments that can relieve suffering and help patients live more fulfilling and productive lives
4374411 along with the ama many patient physician and military groups called on congress to pass this bipartisan bill
4374412 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4374413 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
4374414 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taleban and the bleak alternative that they represent
4374415 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4374416 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4374417 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4374418 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations
4374419 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia
4374420 in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
4374421 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4374422 we endorse a bolder approach to helping vulnerable iraqis especially ones who are displaced current us efforts to help iraqis are a good start but they dont go far enough
4374423 the iraqi government is responsible for assisting its internally displaced population as well as other vulnerable iraqis and all efforts should be made to urge more action and assist its efforts
4374424 as their stay in neighbouring countries drags on without any immediate solution in sight the protection concerns facing these people continue to rise
4374425 the needs are much greater we ask the us to reconsider resettling 105 500 refugees from iraq and if necessary to reassess this number for the next few years
4374426 there is clear negligence by the iraqi government other governments and international bodies via vis the needs of the internally displaced persons idps and refugees in neighbouring countries who are forgotten
4374427 iraq is still a country of conflicts and therefore the most dangerous place in the world
4374428 there are some families who have not been registered yet because government offices are located in remote areas and they find it hard to reach these offices to register
4374429 youre an idiot how about being partial in your reproting who are you john sterling
4374430 this post was stupid and pointless what on earth did this display except that youre cranky
4374431 what is wrong with you ive got to put you out of your misery
4374432 for a good time call mr met 718 577 tixx
4374433 i threw up just a little bit in my mouth
4374434 as someone who loves holiday song parodies this gets a big time thumbs up
4374435 sometimes a franchise just has a big black mark over it and no amount of wishful thinking can turn the tide
4374436 hasta la vista baby i throw up the white flag

4374457 at this point it is hard to see why anyone would stick their neck out for gen musharraf
4374458 i am celebrating our independence which i feel is near
4374459 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4374460 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4374461 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4374462 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions
4374463 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4374464 feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
4374465 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states
4374466 the one thing you really have to do as a nominee is establish your dominance over the party
4374467 people want to see the presidential nominee controlling the convention
4374468 in the interest of being gracious and avoiding the alienation of the clinton people they basically folded
4374469 reluctantly conceded it was safer than having these people walk away from denver disgruntled
4374470 how do you handle this so you dont offend people who dont like the clintons
4374471 on the other hand you dont want to offend the clinton supporters
4374472 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4374473 were really pleased that mayor nutter adopted a lot of dags reform agenda and this appointment caps it off
4374474 but what the planning commission needs right now is not someone with technical expertise but someone with leadership ability who can rally people around a new vision
4374475 i do feel quite sincerely that this is one of those 50 year seminal moments in history of philadelphia and not just another change of administration
4374476 hes someone who understands philadelphias great planning tradition and is inspired to bring the city back to that level
4374477 hes entrepreneurial he has management experience teaching experience at penn its a home run
4374478 it is a political event but it is also a national event that has an impact on the city of philadelphia i mean im going to work
4374479 he has tried to present himself as a guy who took taxpayer dollars very seriously and would only use them in the proper way
4374480 theres no reason why hes got to turn to taxpayer dollars to bring his pals to the convention
4374481 the rest of us will be there performing our duties
4374482 i look at it nobody got hurt and i can replace all the other stuff
4374483 last night we had a major fire in conshohocken probably in the history of the borough its one of the worst weve had
4374484 they say if you have no fear its not for you anymore
4374485 if a firefighter would go down and be trapped we would respond immediately
4374486 as long as everyone comes home something must have gone right
4374487 this act would ultimately clear the way for darla lavalle to pay herself as she saw fit
4374488 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4374489 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4374490 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4374491 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4374492 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4374493 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4374494 im not sure what he was trying to do i think it was a trial balloon
4374495 we hope sen mccain picks someone of his own ideological stripe a pro life running mate
4374496 from a political point of view having a little bit of a rebellion on the right at the republican convention and showing that streak of independence for moderates it wouldnt be so bad
4374497 tom ridge would make a fine vice president and it certainly would help mccain in pennsylvania
4374498 that everything was according to code to the absolute centimeter
4374499 he is clean and follows our codes to a t
4374500 were trying to arrange all the assistance that people need in this level of disaster
4374501 i realized oh god ive got to get out of here
4374502 see what im wearing this is it i have no wallet
4374503 its unbelievable its the scariest thing and i cant believe it happened im just glad they required renters insurance
4374504 is it a day a week a month youve got to be more specific
4374505 she takes a sleeping pill she would have never woken up
4374506 as ambassador to nato i will receive thousands of visitors per year at my residence
4374507 in addition to being an honor and great advertisement for hatboro itself the quilt would speak to all our visitors about our country our history our pride our diversity and the fact that america is a nation built on the hope and hard work of good people in towns small and large
4374508 i have nothing against kurt i watched him grow up and hes a very talented man
4374509 it just shows a nice side of america and starts a different conversation about what america is like
4374510 its not what people traditionally think of its not an andrew wyeth painting but its a piece of folk art and it shows things about real people
4374511 weve made it very clear in a situation in which russia is involved militarily in the sovereign territory of a neighbor there cant be business as usual with russia
4374512 ive always believed elected officials should be seen and this is a great way to
4374513 its the place to be seen you come to see old friends and meet new friends
4374514 i wouldnt slam an outhouse door as hard as they slam people in this general assembly
4374515 i couldnt hit a bull in the ass with a banjo
4374516 i wish i were born as smart as you instead of better looking
4374517 he doesnt mince words he says the things that many of us in politics would love to be able to say
4374518 bud is one of the last of the old time politicians who knows how to have fun
4374519 i dont think its homage but id like to think some people are a little grateful
4374520 the big thing is be prepared to evacuate its something that needs to be in place before any disaster happens
4374521 i ran up the fire escape and grabbed my dog and my phone
4374522 when you walk in the front door and check in you can expect to have pretty much the same experience that people had when they gathered here for a vacation 140 years ago
4374523 when people are booking reservations these are things they ask for
4374524 i dont think these are requests we can ignore but i think we can make these additions without changing the character the ambience of the hotel
4374525 if we were to go in and add insulation and everything else that goes with adding a heating system we would completely change the soul the character of the old building
4374526 preservation of this 132 year old marvel of a building is an ongoing process
4374527 we fell in love with her so many years ago and are delighted her welfare will continue with bob mullocks leadership
4374528 people come to cape may for the history of the town and the people who choose to stay here understand that where they are staying is as important as the destination
4374529 create an authentic experience here that has nothing to do with the outside world and theyre doing that in a very organic way that isnt contrived
4374530 people always say they feel like theyre coming home when they come here to stay

4374532 i have great respect for this panel but i could not disagree more with their analysis or reasoning
4374533 it just seems to be totally wrong to us to have a decision be made on who gets immunity and who does or does not get immunity based not on law but because of political decisions made by the diplomatic corps
4374534 we believe that the court was wrong in its interpretation of the law
4374535 under the courts rationale were a new yorker to be sideswiped by a car driven by an employee of the saudi embassy they could sue for bumps and bruises yet nearly 3 000 families of those innocents who were brutally killed in lower manhattan cannot pursue their claims

4374541 the glory days of tv news are over and the media landscape has been dramatically changed news is available now for everyone everywhere all the time and everybody fights for the last pieces of the shrinking pie the corporate pressure and the ratings terror are intensifying all the time and the situation is not simple i find myself in the last bastion of male dominance and realizing what hillary clinton might have realized not long ago that sexism in the american society is more common than racism and certainly more acceptable or forgivable in any case i think my post and hillarys race are important steps in the right direction

4374544 while writing remarks that queen noor of jordan gave to the un high commission on refugees conference in geneva on wednesday i found i had suddenly become an expert overnight it is mind blowing as we all sit comfortably in our air conditioned homes tomorrow wondering whats in our stocked refrigerators to eat i ask that you take a moment to think about the 20 million people around the world who are refugees doctors and professors business owners and students who were normal people living normal lives who suddenly had to leave home take a moment to give thanks for your own safety and home and just send a small prayer of hope out to those 20 million who are hanging on to their own hope that they too will some day return to their own homes and resume the life they once had they deserve to be recognized even in this small way

4374557 amid all the geopolitical analyses and ideological posturing on the occasion of the three day war between russia and georgia we are losing sight of the very real human costs of this conflict thousands of civilians killed and grievously wounded a city tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia in ruins and the hopes and dreams of the inhabitants of this largely overlooked backwater dashed on the rocks of a politicians hubris
4374558 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4374559 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians

4374585 chiediamo ai lettori di avere ancora un po di pazienza pur consapevoli che ne hanno gi avuta tanta il giornale zeppo di politica daltronde non si parla daltro e oggi e domani si vota questa non una domenica qualsiasi e va affrontata con spirito particolare degno della circostanza qui si tratta di scegliere se affidare il nostro futuro prossimo a un imbonitore dai trascorsi comunisti provetto illusionista e trasformista oppure a un signore maturo di cui conosciamo i vezzi ma anche la solidit ciascuno dei due ha una squadra composta di uomini pi o meno noti dei quali non intendiamo ricordare il curriculum daltronde quello che sanno fare e che non sanno fare non un mistero lo abbiamo sperimentato negli anni scorsi e recentemente sottolineo ma non ce ne sarebbe bisogno che litalia in affanno non sar tutta responsabilit di romano prodi e orchestra per un fatto che nellultimo biennio la sua musica ci ha rotto i timpani e non soltanto quelli veltroni punta a sostituire il professore sul podio e si porta appresso i soliti vecchi suonatori

4374598 sometimes as i have gone witnessing with a group of people i have wondered whether im sharing christ or selling a line of products it is interesting to see how some of the airport cults have picked up on some of our successful formulas and patterns of communicating these cult members are so predictable we can see them coming a mile away like us they tend to offer simplistic pitches because of election we realize that we as christians do not have to resort to such packages of last chance tactics we know that in the final analysis only gods electing redeeming grace and not madison avenue or the latest fads of pop psychology will bring lasting reconciliation between humans and god with this knowledge we can be more comfortable with the biblical message and biblical methods we can approach unbelievers as human beings rather than targets consumers numbers and converts i am tired of evangelical conferences where more time is given to the hype than to the hope where more energy is given to the methods than to the message and where more effort is devoted to techniques than to truth
4374599 and we have to explore other opportunities in wales as well
4374600 obama will work tirelessly to uphold this nations sacred trust with its veterans to ensure they are not forgotten after they return home and he will provide our troops with the leadership they deserve as well as the support they and their families need
4374601 john mccain has been endorsed by more retired admirals and generals than barack obama has military donors
4374602 we feel confident that many u s troops stationed overseas will support john mccain in the election this fall but we suspect most are too busy doing the important work of defending this country than to make political contributions

4374605 its the term african american that you use and is now commonplace that i find confusing and questionable
4374606 is the term african american supposed to translate to black why cant all of us just simply be american
4374607 what is proper depends on the age of the person you are talking about
4374608 i have in my life been colored negro afroamerican african american and black
4374609 for me it is not so much a complexion variable as it is a state of mind issue how you define yourself mostly says where you are in terms of political consciousness
4374610 you are much more likely to find this among younger people
4374611 slightly askance when i say that i am black they see my designation of black as me being caught up in and stuck in the 60s
4374612 all of it is a social construction based on how you view yourself and the climate of opinion that exists at the time you happen to be living
4374613 look how long it took for the word negro a term our forebears accepted to be capitalized the early part of the 20th century
4374614 if you look at my business card it reads professor of afroamerican studies
4374615 it is for me a more succinct way of explaining my experience in this country moderated by the fact that my birth father was black yet because of the color of my skin i am forever questioned whether i am truly american
4374616 there is a young man running for president about whom that question is being whispered everyday
4374617 the young man running for president hes an american and anyone who wants to make anything different of it is barking up the wrong tree
4374618 he you and everyone else can be or call themselves whatever they choose the department i work in used to be called black studies it is now called ethnic studies i teach the same things
4374619 all of it is nothing more than a social construction based on how we view ourselves the only correct answer being whatever you choose for yourself

4374631 talks are underway and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4374632 my belief is that the president does not intend to leave the country there is no question of him leaving pakistan
4374633 it becomes very unimportant for me to comment on these reports i have been hearing all this for the past many months
4374634 musharraf will neither face impeachment nor be prosecuted we expect a major development in the next 48 hours

4374649 it is typical for chinese performers to wear different apparel from different ethnic groups there is nothing special about it
4374650 they will wear different apparel to signify people are friendly and happy together
4374651 rather than announcing chinas arrival as a modern dynamic country they risk reinforcing the view that the beijing government is comprised of control freaks
4374652 fifty six children from 56 chinese ethnic groups cluster around the chinese national flag representing the 56 ethnic groups
4374653 this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable action in china

4374658 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4374659 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4374660 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4374661 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4374673 we know how important motor skill development is in all children but particularly so amongst children with additional needs
4374674 the eight week programs are tailored to each child with specific goals the programs are designed for children between four and 12 years of age who have a physical or intellectual disability learning challenges coordination difficulties behavioural issues or social and self esteem issues
4374675 our focus is on confidence and motivation and developing and enhancing both fine and gross motor skills by involving children in physical activities specifically and individually designed for them
4374676 the uqcanswim program is designed for children who lack confidence or have difficulty in the water
4374677 this one on one program is held in the university of queensland undercover pool and works on goals such as improving fine and gross motor skills sensory processing self esteem and water confidence but most importantly the focus is on fun
4374678 weve had kids who start the uqcanswim program standing terrified on the side of the pool who in a matter of weeks are duck diving and splashing around confident and happy in the water
4374679 the motor active program has seen children master new skills like holding a bat or kicking a ball
4374680 children can be referred to motoractive by a wide range of professionals and also parents who are concerned about their childs movement development upon referral a formal assessment by trained professionals is undertaken
4374681 motoractive provides a unique opportunity to achieve long term improvement of childrens physical mental and social well being giving them the competence and confidence to enjoy physical activity with their friends
4374682 getting kids with additional needs to feel confident in their movement and want to try new activities is important in building their confidence but also in the long term we know children of all abilities who are active and enjoy recreational sport have a better chance of growing up to be fit and active adults

4374695 political freedom was not the ultimate objectives of the freedom fighters we should think how much we have moved forward in ensuring social and economic freedom for the people
4374696 our objective is to make an egalitarian society and our government is working for
4374697 rule of law has been established in the state and priority is being given to give justice to poor and needy

4374700 all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4374701 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world we must defeat them
4374702 dividing people in the name of religion can complicate these issues further which can also pose a threat to unity and integrity of the country
4374703 the sacred shrine of shri amar nath inspires all indians to march together this shrine is a shining example of our secular tradition where hindu pilgrims have been looked after for years by their muslim brothers
4374704 issues related to the sacred place especially the issue of providing the best possible facilities to pilgrims can only be resolved in an atmosphere of peace and goodwill
4374705 we cannot think only for ourselves we cannot think only about survival from day to day from year to year and from one election to another
4374706 major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country
4374707 the nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries will end indias nuclear isolation it will open up new opportunities for trade in dual use technologies opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialisation of our country

4374945 i do not think we should get lost today in long discussions about responsibility or who caused the escalation of the last few days
4374946 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
4374947 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki a russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4374948 the principal element the respect of teritorial integrity of georgia is missing
4374949 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4374950 it is clear that georgia wants this dispute to become something more than a short if bloody conflict in the region
4374951 reiterates with the greatest firmness its condemnation of the coup that took place in mauritania
4374952 i think if youre able to come out here and at least observe whats going on and get some mental reps why not
4374953 some guys cant make it out just because of different kinds of injuries and stuff like that i was a little banged up but i was able to come out here and stay in tune with what was going on and more or less just keep my mind sharp
4374954 thats something i bring to the table i think im a quick study of things im a quick learner and i kind of feel like if they ask me to do anything i can do it whatever they need
4374955 hes got the respect of the coaching staff and the other guys everybody on this team particularly the defense knows the kind of player that he is and what he does for us
4374956 im not happy with what i did today i was working out but its totally different even in practice i just want to be able to come back and display a better job
4374957 ed had some issue right before practice that came up last night that he was in the training room
4374958 sometimes when it doesnt go your way what can you do about it

4374960 thats been or weakness we havent been able to play well against the teams below 500
4374961 i was just running hard because i dont hit enough home runs to know whether it was a home run or not
4374962 shes a fighter inside i told her stay on the job theres nothing to be afraid of this is all a dream
4374963 l a s future depends on our citizens to adopt an ethic of conservation
4374964 hes talked to me about resigning more than a few times each time i get him to realize that we need him
4374965 if residents are being asked not to water their lawns between 9 and 4 shouldnt the city follow the same policy
4374966 its an incredible concentration of threatened and endangered species that are going to be affected by this road
4374967 highlights the fact that the proposed toll road route in particular the san mateo creek watershed is a vital environmental resource
4374968 a lot of work went into designing the alignment to avoid the most sensitive areas of habitat
4374969 its been a highly politicized process that hasnt relied on the best available science and thats one of the bedrock requirements of the endangered species act
4374970 weve always suspected something was going on but this is the first time it has been properly documented
4374971 this is a real find for a time period that is not very well documented in that part of the world

4374974 there were a few days when i was just overthinking everything
4374975 i was in a funk and i had to get out of it i just started playing football again the past few days have been a lot better
4374976 i might have been thinking about it a little bit thinking i had to make a play and may have been forcing it
4374977 its more about just going out there and playing ive been getting better about that
4374978 i still think i have a step and a half missing
4374979 it makes it easy when your o line and fullback are blocking well your lack of speed doesnt show as much
4374980 if i was sleeping it would have woke me up
4374981 those guys are good football players we have to make a decision what to do with those guys i think those guys can help us

4375055 thats a lot of students interacting with each other at very different times we felt we couldnt contain this problem
4375056 we wanted to help take some of the pressure off of parents worrying
4375057 the key to this is educating the parents and the campus
4375058 what we want is everyone always thinking there could be a possibility of an allergic reaction and be on guard for it
4375059 thats one of the biggest allergies in kids and adults
4375060 four to 5 percent of all children have some kind of food allergy and thats one student per classroom
4375061 its a frightening thing for parents to send their child to a public school knowing that each bite of food could be a disaster
4375062 its huge itll be a christmas like weekend saturday is the big day
4375063 itll be significantly bigger than the average saturday the department stores will be advertising big some have markdowns
4375064 in a general sense folks are susceptible to sales this takes on some of the components of a sale
4375065 weve always had a big rush on the tax free weekend
4375066 we spend a little bit more because you spend less on taxes
4375067 we rely fairly heavily on sales tax for the state
4375068 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4375069 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4375070 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4375071 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4375072 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4375073 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4375074 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4375077 the professional developers conference pdc on 27 october and the windows hardware engineering conference winhec the following week both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4375078 this blog will provide context over the next 2 months with regular posts about the behind the scenes development of the release and continue through the release of the product
4375079 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows
4375080 we promise and will deliver such a dialogue with this blog
4375081 from the beginning we each have had our own way in the fight to save the bank but we have continually been in contact now we shall meet soon and set joint candidates for the new board of roskilde bank
4375082 there has been promotion of the figure of 500 million kroner in new money and a further 500 million kroner in old money however i have not seen evidence that this would be enough and little evidence then that there wont be a need for larger amounts if roskilde bank is to be preserved as an independent bank

4375084 comrade malema has erred but we still believe in democracy and as democrats we hope that he will continue to lead us into the future enforcing democracy and dictating democratic processes perhaps with military help if the voters wish it so for many decades to come

4375092 i could be pretty upset pretty easily but why should i be
4375093 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4375094 the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew

4375096 we can do so much more to protect them in an inexpensive way
4375097 the girls have asked me why do we have to be different coach
4375098 wont go to a game where they are being worn
4375099 most teams wear spandex but its up to local communities to decide whats most appropriate
4375100 you wouldnt ask the football team to walk out in shorts
4375101 ive seen some great volleyball players who just wouldnt feel comfortable in tight shorts
4375102 if youre diving on the floor rolling to get up then youre better off in spandex in shorts there are a lot of times when
4375103 i think it should be up to the school and the coach and the community
4375104 were doing more and were going to recommend giving back to the taxpayers
4375105 this clearly is a philosophical shift in that the board has decided to spend a portion of next years projected surplus
4375106 i am going to continue advocating for our patients and our staff that we spend every penny that we can
4375107 or we are going to be here next year explaining how this big pot of money that we have at the end of every year is not a pot of money that we can spend
4375108 we can take the surplus down to zero and we will still make money
4375109 the last thing we want to do is to create positions and come back next year to eliminate positions or to have to ask for a tax increase
4375110 we are increasing services in a thoughtful way and expanding facilities and adding employees which is great
4375111 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and suffering ive brought you
4375112 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness i ask the lord to forgive ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4375113 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape

4375116 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey

4375145 germany is technologically leading in solar technology most solar plants are installed here and what is even more important are produced here

4375283 het is een rustige weloverwogen sprekende man met de uitstraling van een academicus hij doet geen gekke dingen het is geen man die op de tafel klimt en de troepen aanvuurt en enthousiasmeert hij stuurt wel aan maar dwingt niet begrijp je wat ik bedoel

4375285 bij schiphol is sijstermans een aantal maanden uit de running geweest de huidige cio kees jans is hem toen opgevolgd sijstermans is shell gegaan ik begreep de stap van cio bij schiphol groep naar shell niet goed

4375289 it makes a big difference to how you play when your team is winning
4375290 you have that mentality that you are going to win every time you walk out
4375291 so you can go out and express yourself you can do what you want because you feel collectively as a team youre going to win
4375292 okay you dont win every time but you have that feeling every time you go out
4375293 thats nice because i can go out and play the way i want to play not worry about getting out in certain situations
4375294 i can play whichever way i want because i know weve got good players in the back waiting to come in it gives you the freedom to express yourself
4375295 hes probably had one of the best tournaments anyone has ever had in the domestic one day game but unless youre banging out 2 000 runs in the championship one day cricket always gets overlooked a little bit
4375296 hes very hungry about scoring runs hes at a stage where hes not going to play for his country hes just got county cricket and hes very very driven
4375297 hes getting towards the latter years of his career but i think hes got a few of them left and hes got an immense appetite for runs and for improving
4375298 every year hes come back to us hes come back a better player
4375299 there are too many players in county cricket when they cant play for england any more theyre just happy to cruise through wheras van jaarsveld every year makes a little change here and there and becomes a better player and its a credit to him
4375300 we played like we wanted to win we played together
4375301 we were very aware of their offensive sets we were very aware of their personnel and we played like that so we were kind of a step in front of what they wanted to do because we kind of knew everything already
4375302 any time you get beat its embarrassing and thats enough
4375303 and we can really use that as a tool to help us with our defense now and thats the name of the game because if you play good defense no matter how youre shooting the ball youre going to be in the game

4375305 est claro que el tirador norcoreano se dop deliberadamente para mejorar su resultado es probable que la gimnasta vietnamita haya estado mal aconsejada porque sus resultados claramente no mejoraron

4375311 its a standard visit that the congressional delegations typically do
4375312 i think its pretty good for morale to see someone who is high up there coming out here and visiting the troops
4375313 by coming here it shows that they really look out for us that they care for us and want to see how we are doing
4375314 the families in our hometowns will look at this and realize that they are trying to get out and see the soldiers from their hometown
4375315 i appreciate it a lot because these representatives have taken the time to come and actually sit down with their states soldiers and eat lunch
4375316 i appreciate the time that the congressmen the senators or anyone that comes from the state of iowa spends over here with the soldiers
4375317 they try to get a feel for the environment how the political and economic situation has developed in the last few years basically doing litmus test for the funding and where all of our resources are going
4375318 i think ultimately theyre going to see that the situation here is vastly improved
4375319 i think the purpose of the visit is to primarily assess the situation here in iraq and to find out how the troops are doing the morale of the troops and to get their thoughts on how things are going compared to several years ago
4375320 they are more down to earth but they definitely have a job to do
4375321 it shows me that they are actually concerned about what were doing out here its one thing to lead from behind but its another thing to lead when you go into the battle and see whats going on it gives you a different perspective
4375322 i got to meet one of our hometown representatives and its just another one of the great things you get to do in the military
4375323 ultimately it shows a lot of support when they show up here
4375324 its a real vote of confidence that we have backing back in the states
4375325 foram muitos tiros e os policiais reagiram os criminosos fugiram para as matas que cercam as favelas encontramos rastros de sangue no caminho o que indica que algu m do bando foi ferido

4375354 my suit came undone in the first 50 i was just trying to keep my legs going for the last 100 as much as possible

4375363 i think when i have grandkids all the games will be on video and theyll be able to see it for themselves
4375364 theyll see it was a line drive off the wall
4375365 i was in the bullpen and i wasnt having any trouble at all keeping the ball down
4375366 but the oakland seventh was a long inning they the rays had made a pitching change and somewhere between the bullpen and the mound i lost my release point
4375367 i thought that was going to hit off the wall
4375368 that one i thought was out i thought it was going to hit off the top of the scoreboard
4375369 i could have gone scoreless the whole year long and not won the cy young award
4375370 as long as im not remembered just for those first 39 innings ill be ok with that
4375371 he was in the right frame of mind and wanted to play nothing would have stopped him so that is pleasing
4375372 i have no idea what will happen between now and the end of august
4375373 he knew the consequences of playing tonight so the decision was very much his
4375374 i would not be absolutely sure gareth is staying until after the transfer window has closed but he played tonight because he is our player and he wanted to play he thought he was mentally tuned in and thats all that mattered
4375375 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4375376 we obviously need to tighten up our defence if we could but i was very pleased to win
4375377 since it is obvious we dont have any chance in the second leg we will concentrate on the league
4375378 i dont think this game will break us down i doubt well play against a team as good as this again this summer
4375379 the game was over before it began we let in two goals in six minutes when there was a total lack of concentration
4375380 i do not know if players showed aston villa too much respect which was not necessary
4375381 if you go two goals behind against such a team at home obviously it will be difficult but we tried and showed sometimes that we are a good attacking team
4375382 but in football you must also play defence and that we did not
4375383 une g orgie souveraine et libre et son int grit territoriale
4375384 demandons la partie am ricaine de nous convaincre que les cargaisons de ses avions de transport sont de laide humanitaire
4375385 pourquoi ne pas lever le rideau sur ce qui est livr nous les russes cela nous inqui te
4375386 we know we struggled the past four five years in run defense even before i got here
4375387 we have a weak spot that we need to get going
4375388 i love the matchup of a very physical team not a team that tries to trick you they come right at you so im really glad
4375389 its the perfect opponent that we can have right now
4375390 run defense is all about being in the right place at the right time doing your job
4375391 i think were doing a lot better against the run
4375392 were probably more physical we like the challenge as a group
4375393 especially with the secondary we have we want to make them pass the ball
4375394 stop the run on first down get them into second or third and long and well be fine
4375395 anybody want to talk about the pick and roll now
4375396 we watched the game video of 2006 this morning we watched it yesterday pretty much every time we watched the scouting report
4375397 any time you get beat its embarrassing thats enough and we really used that to help us
4375398 this isnt the game that weve been pointing to in the whole olympics
4375399 weve got five more games to win and were here for the gold medal but did we think about it being greece and what happened the last time of course we did
4375400 its a lot different than 2004 when i came in as an 18 year old
4375401 now its all about business im not taking it lightly
4375402 im definitely not disappointed at all not running the 100
4375403 i knew going into the u s olympic track trials it was going to be very tough to make the team i gave it my all it definitely helped the front end of my 200 i think in the end it will definitely pay off
4375404 we have a great rivalry this race is going to be more exciting than they all have been shell be rested weve been waiting for this for a long time shes the main challenge also the rest of the jamaicans as well its going to be a really great final
4375405 their nbcs strategic reasons were made for what people felt are valid commercial reasons i would humbly challenge those reasons this is the second most popular sport in the world to football soccer
4375406 its a huge injustice to the athletes who have worked so hard theres too many exciting athletes to talk about athletes who have cheated amazing things are going to happen
4375407 its a responsibility weve been given the opportunity to do what we love and have america look at us and bring some hope back to the sport maybe we can change the face of the sport
4375408 were excited about the position and ready to take it on
4375409 i felt a little sluggish but my body woke up now
4375410 its pretty gruesome graphic and violent i cant believe the mpaa let us go with it
4375411 its pretty gruesome graphic and violent i cant believe the mpaa let us go with it
4375412 refrain from apportioning blame about who it was that started the war
4375413 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4375414 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4375415 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4375416 a crise na oferta de alimentos passageiras n o coisa perigosa
4375417 he hit his line and lengths right from the word go
4375418 the more the guys play the more they understand what they need to do and when they need to do it
4375419 for the last year he cant put a foot wrong anyway but hes not taking anything for granted and i think the more the bowls the more confidence and belief he gets in himself
4375420 hes following very much in the footsteps of shaun pollock and allan donald and its great for south african cricket if he stays fit for a long time i think hes going to do very well
4375421 braid isnt afraid to make you feel like an idiot with its puzzles but the eventual solutions are all the more satisfying for it the designs are both head slappingly simple and astonishingly complex the more devious puzzles flex rarely used mental muscles with straightforward platforming as a canvas to work from aesthetically inseparable from its time and place braids good looks juxtapose old school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand painted environments the surreal watercolor worlds evoke simple joys and disconsolate dreams as they change palettes and shift in tone complemented in kind by a soothing score of classical and folk arrangements like portal braids short length can be disregarded in the face of its unique approach to storytelling and expansive ideas excellent but intellectually limited as a puzzle platformer braid is made truly divine with emotional depth and a bittersweet humanity
4375422 discussed an article alleging that the mormon church helps fund hamas and likened the mormons treatment of women to the talibans
4375423 steve god sends people into your life for a reason or for a season
4375424 i think that was the same infield i remember for a game in spring training
4375425 he didnt really know what my pattern is its going to take awhile
4375426 he did fine can you imagine up from double a
4375427 it aint easy you learn the hard way in this game its a lot on a kids mind itll be an interesting month and a half
4375428 its the hardest part of the game to swallow when you make your pitch and dont get the guy out
4375429 its frustrating especially because all our games are going to be close typically we dont blow guys out so those little balls that get through like that it just gets frustrating
4375430 he threw one down the middle its not what you expect in that situation the guy berkman is a great hitter he shouldnt get a pitch like that but he did
4375431 the pain was shooting down my leg in my at bat
4375432 it went down my side and my ankle was throbbing from it right now i feel a lot better i dont have the shooting pain down my leg anymore
4375433 the only other stretch i can remember was in 2005 early in the season but i think this is probably a little bit worse its not a lot of fun
4375434 im not trying to describe games right now to be honest with you just
4375435 it will be good to go down and see his old friends and family
4375436 at no time did i say that we would have one guy for one game and one the next i said we wouldnt discuss the specifics because i didnt know what they were going to be
4375437 were talking about what gives us the best opportunity to win im still encouraged by all three quarterbacks whats fair is fair to the team
4375438 id prefer different circumstances but ive just got to make the most of it
4375439 that you can be consistent and make the improvements on what happened in the last game and show how youre growing each day in practice
4375440 its a little unique any time i play an nfc north team because i know a lot of the guys personally
4375441 they say ok tomorrow come to our gym we start
4375442 some kids play two hours and they feel bored i like the training
4375443 i want to put two flags on my face american and chinese
4375444 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take
4375445 i am considerate of the environment but im doing it more for my own pocketbook
4375446 north dakota is the largest state in terms of carbon sequestration and program participation
4375447 its pretty gruesome graphic and violent i cant believe the mpaa let us go with it

4375454 matt and robby took care of me and told me how to conduct myself as a professional i was fortunate to have those guys take a liking to me
4375455 its a weird situation because there are so many of them
4375456 some have done well and some havent and thats what youll see at times theyll be overmatched its not easy because its hard to judge talent at the big league level theres been a pretty big turnover of guys who could maybe play here they have to realize this is their opportunity to show what they can do
4375457 theres a lot of hard work dedication working together with your coach bob and i have been able to work fairly well over the last several years ive banked a lot of workouts back to back thats what set me up to have the meet im having
4375458 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4375459 i knew that was a hard double for ryan lochte i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4375460 what makes him the best is the endurance that he can swim so many races
4375461 his endurance is the main thing that makes him the best
4375462 if he wasnt in this sport and swimming i dont think id be as good
4375463 he is up there and he makes me become better and stronger in training without him i wouldnt be standing here today i think i push him as well
4375464 i didnt know i had as little time as i did
4375465 i didnt have time to go to the ready room i knew it was a tight turnaround the only thing i wanted to do today was win my heat of the 100 fly and get a center lane i hope it sets me up for something good tomorrow
4375466 one of the things bob and i want to do is get out a little better in the first 50
4375467 yesterday in the heats for me to be a body length behind after the first 50 is not where i wanted to be im down to two races im going to try to rest and prepare myself as best i can for them
4375468 i know you dont think you did me wrong and i cant stay this mad for long keeping a hold of what you just let go youre just somebody that i used to know

4375478 ik wist van te voren dat er met een chinese in de finale herrie zou zijn ik was erop ingesteld maar omdat het zolang duurde was ik toch een beetje uit mijn concentratie

4375487 the march symbolizes both the evil and hopeful sides of humanity the evil with the constant balancing act of power within government religion and our financial institutions there lies the chance of those most hungry for power to alter and restrict our freedoms for their gain the hopeful this represents the faith in mankind as the most powerful force on the planet if we come together and do not fight over religion class and borders then we hold the key to a peaceful world there are two possible futures in store either a march of power and greed or a march of a unified human race

4375519 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives

4375595 youre educating a whole wave of consumers once algae becomes available theyll be eager to use it because theyll understand that its possible to fuel their cars with something other than petroleum
4375596 it would be very difficult for anyone to ignore the influence sites like youtube grouper and myspace have had on our society in recent years
4375597 our economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience our economy has continued growing consumers are spending businesses are investing exports continue increasing and american productivity remains strong
4375598 die linkspartei verspricht den w hlern teure wohltaten verschweigt aber woher das geld kommen soll

4375603 for 25 years and maybe more the federal government has talked about reducing our reliance on foreign oil and they havent done a doggone thing about it
4375604 its time we did something america needs leadership when is comes to energy and ethanol is particularly part of that future
4375605 those young men and young women are putting lives on the line every single day in places like iraq to defend our freedom and its all about reducing our dependence on foreign oil
4375606 the military more than any other group appreciates the need to reduce our reliance on foreign oil
4375607 if it werent for oil thats a pretty bold admission of just how little this war really has to do with the so called war on terror
4375608 he felicitado a britta es una excelente persona y una fant stica competidora todo el cr dito para ella porque hizo una excelente carrera
4375609 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
4375610 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4375611 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its not warranted
4375612 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4375613 its what i call a tough policy thats not smart
4375614 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
4375615 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4375616 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4375617 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4375618 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered
4375619 he was not a person of a lot of words but he did carry on conversations
4375620 the majority of people living in xinjiang support national unification and are opposed to terrorism extremists and separatists
4375621 there is extremist propaganda that is radicalizing a segment of the population but government action itself has hastened the pace of radicalization
4375622 although uighur militant groups in xinjiang were thoroughly crushed in the 1990s it seems that a new generation of militants has stepped up to take their place
4375623 the attackers are young and apparently even included two women in kuqa i believe a first in the recent history of violent militancy in the region
4375624 never in 40 years have i seen the number of negatives out in the community that we have no control over that not only impact our ability to raise funds but also has an impact on agencies providing services to the community
4375625 part of that might be concern about what the economy will show in the next six months the uncertainty of whether they will continue to have a job
4375626 when you decide where to cut charitable giving is one area where you may have to curtail or decrease temporarily
4375627 in the last quarter we saw a very serious cooling of giving at all levels
4375628 we need people to feel that theyre well to do regardless of where they are on the spectrum of income
4375629 people who pledge annual gifts pay with appreciated stock and its a good tax write off but right now appreciated stock is hard to find because the market has taken such a dip there will be some that cannot give at the level they did before
4375630 my biggest concern is that those that are having difficulty getting through and give up and those who arent accustomed to asking for help are still sitting there with cutoff notices or putting it on their credit cards and the crisis will come into play in november or december
4375631 work has been a little slow and i got behind
4375632 the significant road construction in sedona impacted our operations in the second quarter and will continue in the third quarter as well
4375633 we look forward to the completion of the road improvements which were designed to streamline traffic while enhancing visual appeal so that we can move forward with the planning and ultimate development of legacy park
4375634 while road construction has been underway we have taken the opportunity to add to our sedona inventory with construction of eighteen one and two bedroom units at premiere vacation club at bell rock and two new luxury platinum units at los abrigados i am also pleased to report that in june 2008 we fully settled the ongoing litigation and are focused in our efforts to return to profitability

4375638 when each mud snail has the ability to produce large quantities of embryos without a partner youve really got a problem
4375639 where theyve gotten into streams in the western part of the country theyve caused a lot of problems
4375640 theyre taking over space that should have other native species living in it
4375641 i could sum it up in one word nothing the permit doesnt change a thing
4375642 amid all the geopolitical analyses and ideological posturing on the occasion of the three day war between russia and georgia we are losing sight of the very real human costs of this conflict thousands of civilians killed and grievously wounded a city tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia in ruins and the hopes and dreams of the inhabitants of this largely overlooked backwater dashed on the rocks of a politicians hubris
4375643 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4375644 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4375645 mikheil saakashvilis decision to use the opening of the olympic games to cover georgias invasion of its breakaway province of south ossetia must rank in stupidity with gamal decision to close the straits of tiran to israeli ships
4375646 what it isnt is its not an action plan there are no maps in this document for example there are no indications of how the transport strategy in the future is going to be linked into land use population growth
4375647 if they were serious we wouldve seen some more macro announcements with dollars committed to looking at the future
4375648 all we have to show for it is a lousy bus network which does not provide the services that are so badly needed
4375649 this announcement today will make no difference to how we do public transport in canberra
4375650 the fed is in the same uncomfortable position as it has been for months caught between a weak economy and elevated inflationary pressures only more so
4375651 we continue to expect the fed to hold the fed funds rate at 2 0 percent into 2009
4375652 the problem is the fear in the credit market and it is going to take a while to settle down i think it is two years and were only halfway there
4375653 gasoline prices rose 4 1 percent in july and are up 37 9 percent in the past 12 months food and beverage prices are up 5 8 percent in the past 12 months
4375654 food prices continued to pressure the top line rising 0 9 percent following a 0 8 percent june advance five of the six major grocery store groups posted increases of at least 1 0 percent restaurant meal prices accelerated in july
4375655 the good side is we know oil prices have come down since july and that should make it a little easier for them
4375656 theyre in a box but that box isnt that uncomfortable and its pretty well padded
4375657 in many areas with large concentrations of foreclosure sales homes are being purchased below replacement costs
4375658 many buyers with long term expectations are getting exceptional value in the current market

4375682 the adrenaline started there murray positioned himself at the back of the bakkie while i went around the left hand side
4375683 the driver looked at me but didnt know who i was because i was wearing civvies which was a bonus
4375684 we knew we had the right people because besides the vehicle fitting the description relayed over radio control every suspect in that vehicle was either wearing gloves or socks over their hands
4375685 to put your life in danger i think is worth it to get those bad people but in our case it was pure luck and we just happened to be at the right place at the right time

4375791 a lot of work went into providing a tour for mr mckenzie
4375792 after seeing its outcome its obvious that supporting events like this are always worth it
4375793 the base put forth much effort into making this day as great as it was
4375794 the airman who was operating the flight simulator said i was pretty good so i cant wait for the chance to get into the real thing
4375795 the doctors only gave him a few more years to live and i wanted to do something special for richard before he goes away
4375796 i searched wish foundations on the internet to coordinate for him the chance to sit in the cockpit of a fighter jet
4375797 everyone believes what they do is the most important job in the military
4375798 but its humbling to know that someones life ambition is to do what i get the privilege to do on a daily basis
4375799 i always dreamed about being a fighter pilot today i got the chance and i couldnt be happier
4375800 our primary goal for international pilot training is to build a foundation that will enable us all to carry out operations as coalition partners
4375801 and this wing has the people equipment and experience to do just that
4375802 over the last 19 years the wing has trained more than 750 pilots from 23 of the 24 nations that fly the f 16 its a mission we know very well
4375803 enhancing the air capabilities of other nations is what we do and as senior leaders often point out its an undertaking of the utmost significance in our post cold war environment
4375804 what the last 25 years have shown is that the threats can emerge almost anywhere in the world but our own forces and resources will remain finite
4375805 to fill this gap we must help our allies and partners to confront extremists and other potential sources of global instability within their borders
4375806 by the time an initial student pilot arrives in tucson he already has his pilot wings and hes graduated from the defense language institute so we can be sure he knows how to fly and how to communicate in english
4375807 our job is to start the student out in the f 16 from square one
4375808 first and foremost the 162nd has a tremendous safety record because our maintenance personnel here average 18 years of experience specializing on the f 16
4375809 there are very few places in the world with this kind of airspace for military training
4375810 finally we average 17 000 flying hours per year and were able to do that because of arizonas year round good weather less than 3 percent of scheduled sorties here are canceled due to weather thats practically unheard of in other parts of the world
4375811 the students get the best possible flight education when they come here
4375812 our pilots average 10 years of instructor time and 2 300 flying hours in the f 16
4375813 on its most basic level its about flying together operating together and training together so if we have to we can fight together
4375814 on a deeper level its about friendships with more than 4 000 f 16s in operation around the world creating the foundation of a relationship is absolutely invaluable
4375815 we are relieved to be able to report that matts condition has improved and that he is now fully conscious
4375816 however he remains in intensive care and his recovery is expected to take several weeks
4375817 matt is under the care of a team of top cardio pulmonary and infection specialists here in hong kong who have diagnosed matt with severe pneumonia and believe he is making gradual progress
4375818 we have been so moved by the concern shown for matts safety and well being both in china and australia
4375819 matt has had the very best medical care and our family is eternally grateful to matts team of doctors in beijing and hong kong
4375820 high interest rates and an extremely onerous set of local state and federal government taxes and charges on new housing continue to slug new home buyers
4375821 it is clear that unless there is action in removing the layered taxation and other imposts on new housing that affordability and availability will continue to decline
4375822 the concept of energy and the flow of that energy in the human body is the core of the current explosion in healing
4375823 as we felt new power flow in as we enjoyed peace of mind as we discovered we could face life successfully as we became conscious of his presence we began to lose our fear of today tomorrow or the hereafter we were reborn
4375824 we had a new employer being all powerful he provided what we needed if we kept close to him and performed his work well established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves our little plans and designs more and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life
4375825 its a tremendous blow we wont get the day to day development we need for our young players and the profile of the game is much higher when youve got a team in the australian national league
4375826 everyone else playing here is a professional player and unless new zealand can get their players into a professional environment it will always be difficult to come to the olympics and be competitive
4375827 we did everything possible that we could do we had tremendous support from sparc and the new zealand olympic committee nzoc but in the end the level of talent is different
4375828 our lack of experience lets us down this team is averaging 22 1 2 years of age but on the upside theyve had olympic experience i think youll see they will be better for this in 2012 london olympics
4375829 im hopeful there will still be a team next year basketball nz will work hard to ensure that
4375830 the majority of the players we need to keep for the next campaigns will find a team
4375831 he was a local member of the central hawkes bay community as i said a well though of person he basically conned us
4375832 were still receiving the beacon the helicopter has been into the area in the mueller glacier has picked up quite a strong signal
4375833 obviously weve got six australian who have signed into the park and have not signed out they are carrying this particular beacon
4375834 we know they took some basic alpine equipment but this time of the year transceivers probes shovels are absolutely essential
4375835 there is a number of scenarios which theyve discussed here avalanche just got stuck got lost all the scenarios are there the team that flew in this morning described that there is some avalanche activity in the area
4375836 yamabuki ogon with pure yellow metallic sheen on the entire body
4375837 designed to resemble a gigantic antiquated camera the eight foot long encasement actually houses a professional quality digital slr camera complete with a built in lighting setup
4375838 in one episode from season three of satc charlotte memorably comments women just really want to be rescued im sorry but its true ive been dating since i was 15 im exhausted
4375839 the olympic games have been running very smoothly so we are planning to make some changes in scheduling our press briefing
4375840 its not that we dont want to come and talk to you guys its just that on the operations front everything is going fine
4375841 well see how things are going to decide on briefings
4375842 i think if you are asking us to appraise areas outside sport thats not our remit to do so were not qualified to do that the world is invited here to make its own appraisal and that is clearly what you will do the world will look back after these games are finished and take their perspectives
4375843 on the issue of tibetan independence this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable kind of activity in china
4375844 during the bid i was the secretary general of the bidding committee
4375845 i was confronted with many questions about the opening up and reform of china
4375846 people are always saying you need to get fired up i just want to play some ball we are both pretty laid back guys and off the court that is huge thats why it works
4375847 most of the guys and girls have fantastic bodies everyone is pretty shredded up it is part of the show
4375848 a girl wants to see a guy without his shirt on he has got nice abs and everything versus having it on
4375849 they always get my size wrong and think i am xxl so it looks as if i am wearing a dress
4375850 it started in atlanta and it gets better every time
4375851 i think it is the ambience most of the sports that you go to you are supposed to be quiet you are not supposed to be cheering and being loud and everythings much more cultured and classical
4375852 at beach volleyball there is music playing the whole time most of the guys are in board shorts and you have got dancing girls coming in that are beautiful everyone is drinking beers together it is more of a festive and party atmosphere
4375853 obviously it is cool to go to other sports and to see that sport itself but beach volleyball is entertainment as well for every second you are there it is a show
4375854 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4375855 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4375856 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4375857 i cant hide under the radar any more when number ones in the world lose its always in the headlines it looks a little more extreme
4375858 its just not so easy to keep it up all the time eventually sometimes they get you
4375859 we have nowhere to live we have no clothes at all
4375860 last time they had a moving van now they dont even have a duffel bag
4375861 we are a small community and our hearts reach out to everybody whos been affected
4375862 i feel like i should be angry but im just glad to be alive and im glad to have my cat itll probably hit me later
4375863 its amazing how the american red cross the fire department and the police department seized the moment
4375864 they were exceptional in their response they had a presence with us
4375865 curious to know why there hasnt been a lot of information from bozzuto management
4375866 a companys job is to make money and when they stop making money they unload
4375867 nobody is feeling sorry for the owners of the bridge
4375868 cape may county is the sixth most vulnerable place in the country for storms like hurricanes or noreasters
4375869 well probably change the toll to one way and increase it to 1
4375870 were a team the more medals we get as a team the better i dont care who wins them
4375871 people who want to be international athletes they want the limelight
4375872 i think this is a little bit more than we would normally enjoy were kind of quiet people
4375873 i would not trade having katy by my side all the time for anything in the world but i will tell you that it is when the other one is competing it is very difficult to keep your mind on your own game
4375874 granted at this olympics its been a little easier because we dont compete at the same time at world cups it is definitely a challenge when we have to compete on the same day
4375875 you can just watch and cross your fingers and thats all and just wait
4375876 i always try always go for the win of course but the reality is that at the moment he is unbeatable
4375877 im not going to lack motivation its always been the case that i wanted to beat him
4375878 i always aim for his times as my target that is going to continue to motivate me
4375879 i think he can be beaten and i want to beat him
4375880 im satisfied with those three silvers i dont feel like i missed out on something
4375881 i was so nervous when i walked in my heart just sunk
4375882 at the end i heard the whole crowd clapping and cheering and i couldnt believe it they were cheering for me
4375883 this obviously isnt like any track meet ive been to
4375884 i got nervous last night and wasnt sure about all this but you get to the stage where its too late to pull out and you just have to go with it
4375885 it does give you motivation to work harder and try and qualify for next time
4375886 its expensive to fly there so we usually have only sent my dad
4375887 they were trying to organize for me to go there after i competed at the south pacific games and before this but it didnt get organized
4375888 my coach told me the other girls were going to be very fast i just closed my eyes and tried not to be disturbed and it turned out well
4375889 i enjoy my life i have a positive environment in berlin and i train in one of the best pools we have
4375890 in an olympic final you want to compete against the best it would have been difficult without her
4375891 it was good that i had her next to me
4375892 shes so different from me she starts faster and i swim more evenly at the end of the day shes the world record holder and shes only second but thats what sport is all about
4375893 full credit to her she kept driving through the wall
4375894 at that moment i didnt know what had happened on the other side
4375895 i only knew where libby was beside me and i thought i should be faster than her but then i turned around and everything was great
4375896 the intent was that the building would serve as its own sign
4375897 in this case the sign is tacked on and totally alien to the building
4375898 they really dont want to live in a building thats branded as the unisys building
4375899 if we didnt get the signage wed have to re evaluate how important visibility is to us in that decision
4375900 we feel that the signs on two liberty place would mar and tarnish the building as well as the philadelphia skyline
4375901 i was so nervous when i walked in my heart just sunk
4375902 at the end i heard the whole crowd clapping and cheering and i couldnt believe it they were cheering for me
4375903 this obviously isnt like any track meet ive been to
4375904 i got nervous last night and wasnt sure about all this but you get to the stage where its too late to pull out and you just have to go with it
4375905 it does give you motivation to work harder and try and qualify for next time

4375912 on the issue of tibetan independence this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable kind of activity in china
4375913 during the bid i was the secretary general of the bidding committee
4375914 i was confronted with many questions about the opening up and reform of china and i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china to open up further and to reform
4375915 the prevailing view with autism is that the individual struggles to comprehend other peoples emotions

4375922 con m s sorpresas para el online que ser n desveladas pronto hay muchas razones para creer que pes 2009 ser el videojuego que todo el mundo estaba esperando
4375923 my coach told me the other girls were going to be very fast i just closed my eyes and tried not to be disturbed and it turned out well
4375924 i enjoy my life i have a positive environment in berlin and i train in one of the best pools we have
4375925 in an olympic final you want to compete against the best it would have been difficult without her
4375926 it was good that i had her next to me
4375927 shes so different from me she starts faster and i swim more evenly at the end of the day she is the world record holder and shes only second but thats what sport is all about

4375930 i only knew where libby was beside me and i thought i should be faster than her but then i turned around and everything was great
4375931 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4375932 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4375933 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4375934 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4375935 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4375936 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4375937 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4375938 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4375939 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4375940 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4375941 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4375942 who are open to doing something on the production side
4375943 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4375944 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4375945 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4375946 why are the five of you looking at us weird like that
4375947 you accursed beasts cannot kill me ill tear off the head of each and ev aargh
4375948 what do you hope to achieve ill simply come back and when i do ill hunt doe each one of you and all your kind to the ends of the earth youll have nowhere to hide and time is on my side
4375949 such intrigue action devastation truly a fascinating game go now you have won your freedom until next time
4375950 so you planning on sticking around for too long id like to have my body for myself again and imagining you in there makes me sick
4375951 but im kind of without a body to call my own right now we can however seek out a new one perhaps a nerborn whose soul would be easy to pluck out and devour as i make myself cozy
4375952 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4375953 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4375954 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4375955 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4375956 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4375957 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4375958 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4375959 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4375960 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4375961 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4375962 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4375963 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4375964 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4375965 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4375966 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4375967 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4375968 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4375969 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4375970 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4375971 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4375972 why are the five of you looking at us weird like that
4375973 you accursed beasts cannot kill me ill tear off the head of each and ev aargh
4375974 what do you hope to achieve ill simply come back and when i do ill hunt doe each one of you and all your kind to the ends of the earth youll have nowhere to hide and time is on my side
4375975 such intrigue action devastation truly a fascinating game go now you have won your freedom until next time
4375976 so you planning on sticking around for too long id like to have my body for myself again and imagining you in there makes me sick
4375977 but im kind of without a body to call my own right now we can however seek out a new one perhaps a nerborn whose soul would be easy to pluck out and devour as i make myself cozy
4375978 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4375979 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4375980 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4375981 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4375982 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4375983 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4375984 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4375985 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4375986 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4375987 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4375988 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4375989 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4375990 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4375996 if i step onto the tatami again i may probably be thrown again im really empty now
4375997 eating with tony is a great way to ruin your appetite
4375998 youll be biting into a piece of meat and hell say you know that cow was probably corn fed and because of that they had to give it antibiotics and that probably gave it ulcers i dont even want to think about what might be in there by then youre pretty much ready to clear your plate
4375999 seriously my recovery is so much better than its ever been and my endurance is tremendous the best part is that during games i really dont get tired i have more focus too im even staying awake in meetings
4376000 sometimes wed do all that shifting and defenses wouldnt move
4376001 theyd just sit there and wait and wed run the ball into an eight man front and get stuffed even when we had a mismatch the quarterback didnt have the freedom to change the play at the line its dumbfounding that we didnt do that
4376002 plus hes such a crafty tight end he knows all the little push off moves and how to use his body and post you up
4376003 one of my biggest role models in the nfl because of his work ethic a lot of people dont see that they see tony gonzalez superstar pretty boy the guy who has to be dressed just right and have his hair done before he does anything but the guy works hes out there catching 100 balls a day he never drops a ball in practice and never lets up hes an absolute machine
4376004 they still think that too because i look so skinny but i weigh what ive always weighed
4376005 at least twice a week hell be like man what are you eating
4376006 ill look down and say fried chicken cheese and then hell stop eating his big ol salad and give me the talk hell say 1 or 13 you can eat like that and play one year or eat like this play 13 and you know what i listen
4376007 but dwayne bowe is out there tapping his helmet saying come get me
4376008 well at least ive got some clarity on my situation
4376009 i drained my last shot and went out a winner
4376010 eigentlich hat die kunst sich immer sehr bem ht sich der mode zu verweigern aber heute ist sie mit ihr eine symbiose eingegangen inzwischen ist mode auch so eine art inszenierung die weit ber das dekorative hinausgeht
4376011 ja doch sie kann einen mit dem ansinnen des bleibenwollens auch bedrohen nicht wahr ich meine alles ist verg nglich au erdem ist es ja auch nicht so dass man nach einer saison alles wegwirft ich entdecke oft kleider die drei vier jahre alt sind und denke ach so etwas sch nes f llt dir heute nicht mehr ein ich geh re ja noch zu den dinosauriern der mode die alles selbst machen
4376012 ja und irritation ich finde kleider die aussehen als br uchte man anziehhilfen unerotisch designer wie alexander mcqueen foltern frauen mit korsetts und st tzstangen meine kleider sollen so aussehen als ob jemand wie brigitte bardot direkt aus dem meer kommt wie damals in cannes ich sah das als junge die brauchte nur ein schlampiges t shirt dagegen wirkten alle anderen hollywood stars auf einmal wie alte gebrauchte cadillacs
4376013 guter stil ist es souver n mit seinen fehlern umgehen zu k nnen das haben frauen wie jennifer lopez vorgemacht mit ihrem viel zu dicken arsch ich finde das nat rliche unzul ngliche viel aufreizender als das glatte
4376014 ich versuche den zeitgeist nicht zu treffen denn der geht vor ber und dann stehst du dumm da allein auf der party heute werden die sachen durch die medien so bekannt gemacht wenn ich dann eine 60 j hrige mit der must have bag sehe sieht die frau doppelt so alt aus wie ihre tasche man kann sich auch ins abseits shoppen
4376015 were space pirates think of johnny depp as a romulan
4376016 i just kept saying this is too weird and leo was like oh get over it and im going yeah a little reminder youre my best friend
4376017 i hadnt realised how much my chemistry with him since titanic would still stick its great to discover we can just slip right into it like muscle memory
4376018 we knew that if we were going to do something again it had to be something big and emotional i played this very clever cat and mouse game to get my husband and then my best friend involved
4376019 als ik mij verloren voel als niemand meer raad weet voor de komende morgen dan nog schenkt gij mij zekerheid de zekerheid dat gij er zijt en over mij waakt

4376021 het algemeen geloof is nu dat wij n god in de drieheid en de drieheid in de eenheid aanbidden zonder de personen te vermengen of het wezen te delen wie dit niet oprecht en standvastig gelooft kan niet behouden worden
4376022 wij hebben in nederland al een koffiebranderij en het europese hoofdkantoor het is mooi is dat we nu de ambitie kunnen realiseren om dichter bij de stad te komen bij het grote publiek
4376023 we zouden graag in de winkelstraten willen zitten maar over concrete plannen kan ik nu niets zinvols zeggen daar is bijvoorbeeld een goede partner voor nodig bovendien moeten we kijken naar de vastgoedmarkt wat er vrij komt aan a locaties
4376024 well the clothes dont fit me now and the storage for them was costing me the price of a small mortgage
4376025 why are the five of you looking at us weird like that
4376026 you accursed beasts cannot kill me ill tear off the head of each and ev aargh
4376027 what do you hope to achieve ill simply come back and when i do ill hunt doe each one of you and all your kind to the ends of the earth youll have nowhere to hide and time is on my side
4376028 such intrigue action devastation truly a fascinating game go now you have won your freedom until next time
4376029 so you planning on sticking around for too long id like to have my body for myself again and imagining you in there makes me sick
4376030 but im kind of without a body to call my own right now we can however seek out a new one perhaps a nerborn whose soul would be easy to pluck out and devour as i make myself cozy
4376031 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4376032 one of the reasons for having hybrids is to reduce dependence on foreign oil
4376033 you dont want to substitute dependence on foreign oil with dependence on foreign materials for lithium ion batteries
4376034 other countries such as korea and japan have identified advanced battery research and production as competitive priorities we have to make sure not to cede that competitive race
4376035 if we rely on foreign sources for those products we still could in a sense be relying on foreign sources of energy
4376036 senator fumo says he is not getting in the middle of that election because he has several good friends who are running

4376060 despite or perhaps in spite of the screenings an ad hoc coalition of more than a dozen disabilities groups held a conference call on the weekend to lay the groundwork for at least one protest in every state starting this week
4376061 it still amazes me that people actually watching me with a gun didnt just burst out laughing
4376062 i cant even play ping pong but it turns out im good with weapons ive got enormous hands like a transsexual and thats probably why
4376063 if the music thing hadnt worked out illustrating is probably what id be doing when i was a kid i was always writing or painting
4376064 i tried playing football once but i got hit real hard and i left the field never to return i tried out for basketball too but i was never good enough
4376065 i used to draw portraits and caricatures of people and get 10 or 20 dollars a time it was handy because that way i never needed to ask my mum for money

4376067 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4376068 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4376069 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4376070 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4376071 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4376072 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4376073 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4376074 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4376075 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4376076 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4376077 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4376078 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4376079 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4376080 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4376081 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4376082 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4376083 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4376084 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4376085 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4376086 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4376087 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4376088 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4376089 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4376090 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4376091 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4376092 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4376093 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4376094 that he had no previous residence or visits to the united states
4376095 because the increase is small its awfully hard to come up with an interpretation
4376096 were pleased because the targets increased in math and reading
4376097 clearly we need to do more to improve the high school experience and ensure those students stay engaged and challenged through graduation
4376098 we are happy by the increase in ayp scores but we are aware that we have not progressed to where we should be theres a new sense of urgency and we want to move forward to increase the number of ayp schools
4376099 you dont have to be alan greenspan to know we have to do something about this
4376100 i think we should at least be adult enough to talk about anything
4376101 while we do not embrace this contract we accept this contract

4376130 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4376131 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4376148 there is no credible evidence that airborne products taken as directed will reduce the severity or duration of colds or provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places
4376149 to be honest i already spend quite a lot of time between the races analysing the data and keeping fit this summer break gave me the opportunity to get away from that and focus on just recharging my batteries looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
4376150 im wary of making predictions the race in hungary showed just how unpredictable formula 1 can be and thats one of the reasons why its such a fascinating sport clearly though i am still in a good position to challenge for the world championship and that remains my aim we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and are confident well be competitive this weekend the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
4376151 i had very much a working holiday i spent some time in woking with my engineers preparing for this weekend and i also spent some time back in finland at my home town of suomussalmi where i help organise an annual karting event in the town obviously having just won the most recent grand prix made it a fantastic event for everybody it was my first time back in finland for quite a long time too so it was great to turn up as a grand prix winner
4376152 the win doesnt change too much really i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races and im really looking forward to that
4376153 it looks pretty fast to be honest you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite there are a lot of fast kinks and esses a couple of decent straights and lots of high speed stuff its too early to say yet whether there will be opportunities to overtake around here but there are a couple of hairpins where it might be possible
4376154 in terms of car set up we need to remember that like the track will be both green and dusty on the opening day of practice that sometimes tempts you into playing with set up more than you would like so you need to resist that temptation and let the track come to the car our simulations suggest well employ a downforce level similar to that of hockenheim but the individual demands of the track may push that window up or down finally anybody whos studied any onboard footage of the circuit will be mindful of the proximity of the concrete barriers in certain areas clearly well be packing plenty of spares but hoping we wont need to use them
4376155 the most important thing is to be thorough methodical and iterative although we arrive at a new racetrack having undertaken a huge amount of research and armed with an enormous amount of data the reality is that its really only the starting point for our engineering team we begin friday practice the way we would at any other circuit but in this instance we need to pay particular attention both to driver feedback and the data generated from the car the important thing is not to react too hastily its vital that you dont end up going down the wrong path because you only have a limited amount of time to tune the set up before qualifying
4376156 clearly spain has become a tremendously important market for formula 1 over the past five years and the addition of a second spanish race to the calendar rightly reflects the sports success and popularity in the market
4376157 everything weve seen about the city and the organisation of this event leads me to believe it will be a fantastic success and set a new standard for formula 1 more importantly it marks a return to city racing something we will also witness in singapore and next year in abu dhabi and thats something that really engages the people and fans far more than at a purpose built circuit out of town this is an important time for the growth of the sport and everybody at vodafone will be hoping the weekend is a fantastic success both for the team itself and the sport as a whole
4376158 lewis heikki and the entire team performed excellently achieving three race wins in a row since the beginning of the previous season we have won 13 out of 28 races and if possible we want to improve this success rate however the maiden race in valencia will be a new game for everybody
4376159 when you think about temporary street races in formula 1 you mainly think about valencia does not have very much in common with this classic race just that both cities are located on the mediterranean coast and that both circuits lead along the harbour front

4376174 hes doing well actually we went to cape town south africa and he had a little trouble with the travel there but hes all recovered from that setback now

4376183 the new facility gives us the ability to rapidly deploy our local technicians in a wide service radius throughout west texas and in most cases will allow us to save our customers from additional travel and per diem costs normally associated with deployment from far away locations we believe that our new location demonstrates our commitment to the texas market and we look forward to the opportunity to help meet the current and growing demand for o amp m and technician services in west texas

4376220 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given
4376221 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4376222 wow did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a paedophile i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money

4376230 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4376231 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4376232 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4376233 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4376234 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4376280 you definitely dont want to open up a tournament with a first game loss the bottom line was the billings scarlets beat the billings scarlets we picked a terrible time to play our worst game of the season
4376281 today was a lot of jitters including myself its just extra games to get back to the championship game and it starts with california
4376282 got a little bit up they hit the ball and did a good job it just wasnt my day
4376283 hopefully well get a good outing out of him and live to play another day
4376284 we burn 220 000 gallons of diesel fuel a year
4376285 thats a cost you have to pay and account for
4376286 for any small business finding 600 000 or 700 000 extra on the bottom line is tough to do
4376287 we cant go out of our way to play them theyve got to be on the route now
4376288 its bigger and its heavier to drive the ride around
4376289 we used to go to wyoming to powell and riverton the fuel cost wasnt worth it

4376295 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4376296 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4376297 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4376298 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4376299 im very excited that i can continue with the organization and help the team keep moving in the direction were going
4376300 its exciting to be a part of the team that is building towards the ultimate goal
4376301 he is a very energetic coach who brings a lot of enthusiasm and passion to the game and we look forward to working together over the next few years
4376302 my family and i are very happy in the area and im very excited about the upcoming year
4376303 last season we knew that in order for us to improve a lot of our young players needed to mature and each one of them did this offseason paul holmgren did a great job of keeping players here as best we could and continued to improve our team i think were ahead of where we were last year i think were doing a great job of being physically ready and also we have a great attitude
4376304 every day i try to get better as a head coach and i think i am
4376305 i have almost 2 full years now i know what works for us and i know how to prepare for the opponents i feel comfortable
4376306 he is a very energetic coach who brings a lot of enthusiasm and passion to the game and we look forward to working together over the next few years
4376307 this is something that we talked about in the early part of the summer we knew that it was just a matter of time before we got it done i love being part of this organization and the direction that the team is headed

4376310 theres an athlete pool out there we can tap into to be successful we have struggled for decades to figure out a formula
4376311 look at baseball basketball american football the u s knows how to build a sport
4376312 it was always my fathers dream to have handball become big in the u s
4376313 maybe ill become a trainer in the u s one day
4376314 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
4376315 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
4376316 even if it is a heart attack the recent situation in england with the deteriorating relations with russia has led people to be suspicious even when there arent any grounds to be suspicious
4376317 what is currently not available in georgia is the transparency of who the owners are what their interests are there is a lot of speculation about who is who and what their real stake is in these stations and wherever there is a lot of rumor there is a lot of room for speculation
4376318 es preciso aclarar que la resoluci n de amparo contempla la posibilidad de que le sea dictada una nueva orden de aprehensi n tal y como aconteci en su oportunidad con f lix estrella

4376320 its a really really deep record on so many different levels i read over kurts journals and even if i could get inside his head i dont think id want to be there
4376321 but it rocks theres a folk strain running through it with these strange little confessionals but its really out of time now and in 1991 it was the sound
4376322 im honestly not a big fan of come as you are i think its one of the weaker tracks but that gave us the chance to break it down and do what we wanted to with it it freed us up
4376323 the first time i played it on my guitar and started singing it normally it didnt really work
4376324 but when i started whispering and shouting it took it to a completely different level which i was totally satisfied about
4376325 to be honest we blagged our way into doing this and we got them on a technicality as there was a hidden track on the album
4376326 we had to polish it a bit obviously this song left us with an open page so we just chopped away at it
4376327 my heart was beating when the lowly knights were up there 13 musicians i wasnt sure the stage was going to take it and then fighting with wire hammering out smells like teen spirit rachel austin going mad with cellos being madder than kurt cobain which was brilliant
4376328 we were all quietly alarmed when the lowly knights gave us the specs for what they wanted to do with all these strange instruments and choirs but it held up pretty well when rachel austin got into the swing of that song it was a mad thing to witness
4376329 its been very quiet we havent seen any plumes and weve had really cool cloudy weather all day
4376330 its been really really quiet one of our quietest days so far
4376331 these are two good young teams and those are two of the biggest young stars right there
4376332 were hoping kevin love will have the same impact in his rookie season as durant did last year with seattle
4376333 i feel like we should make a big jump in the win column this season
4376334 our young guys were really starting to play well at the end of last season
4376335 i felt like even if wed added nothing from last season we would have been above 500 this season now with the additions of kevin love and mike miller we have a chance to really make some noise this season
4376336 weve had a great relationship with the people here and im glad were coming back
4376337 i want to thank wayne hirsch and metrapark general manager bill dutcher for putting it together again
4376338 i really enjoy this area of the country im hoping this time ill have a little more time to get out and see some of the sights while im here
4376339 how federal regulators lenders and wall street created americas housing crisis nine proposals for a long term recovery
4376340 it aint nothing crazy like hes missing or whatever i just want accountability to make sure that he dont come up there while hes on his time to do something crazy because i asked him to call me but he never called
4376341 so im just trying to cover my ground to say hes there or hes with his wife because i know they got a little problem or whatever the case may be
4376342 search of the centralized operations police system did not reveal any prior domestic assault allegations or weapons registered to sgt lopez or mrs lopez
4376343 review of sgt lopezs medical records showed there were no indicators of post traumatic stress disorder and he was not prescribed any medication for ptsd
4376344 sgt lopez and his wife were pending a divorce for some unknown act of infidelity
4376345 i tried to come here and be the right person for my wife and kids but i guess im not the right person im messed up boss im messed up
4376346 i was a lot worse off over there than i showed my life is so messed up right now i couldnt take it im figuring out how to stay alive
4376347 hes suicidal and i dont want nothing to happen to this young soldier
4376348 i was wondering if someone could go by his parents house and see if hes at his parents house or if they know where hes at and let them know that yes hes sending his boss text messages about suicidal thoughts
4376349 maybe theyll tell where this man is at so we can get him back here and get him some help
4376350 i dont want this dude to commit suicide or to kill his family you know and thats whats on our minds right now
4376351 im actually trying to help steven were worried about him and the welfare of his family right now
4376352 thats probably why hes worried about coming in he thinks hes going to get arrested for being awol
4376353 im not going to have him dead tomorrow because i didnt go find him
4376354 im not getting him in trouble he should know me better than that
4376355 just so you know youre not in any trouble they havent put out any warrants or anything for you being gone so thats not what its about
4376356 hes having a rough time but he says hes not going to hurt himself
4376357 i told him that he needed to get his butt back right away so hopefully hes going to take that to heart
4376358 ill probably give you a call probably thursday or friday of this week
4376359 my dad is buying me a bus ticket asap since the army quit paying me after six years of my life i gave to it ill call you or someone when i get to the bus stop
4376360 im expecting to have a really good meet down here
4376361 we seem to have more horses this year than ever
4376362 i have to decide what kind of horses i have on the grounds and write races that fit most of them
4376363 if they come down that straightaway in a herd that means that race was written right for most of them
4376364 but i dont care what you write youre still going to have some horses strung out like pack strings
4376365 we were up every single day as far as betting handle
4376366 the attitude on the backside in great falls was wonderful this year
4376367 people were upbeat they were looking forward to racing and they were getting more interested in buying horses
4376368 so one way or another ive been connected to racing since 1959
4376369 i like people and to me horses are like people they have personalities funny little quirks
4376370 ive got a couple of horsemen that i love dearly and i throw one of them out of the race office at least once a year
4376371 the next day hes back and hes fine hes eating licorice
4376372 its not as bad now as it used to be because now we have computers
4376373 we can kick out lists of the things we need
4376374 but if you dont have the horses name spelled right its a disaster
4376375 one horseman will draw an entry blank with the horses name on it out of the wooden box and another will draw a pea
4376376 just knowing that the horsemen are happy to be able to run their horses
4376377 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4376378 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4376379 its never that thought out maybe more just because ive never gone for a character specifically

4376391 as we invested some money to prepare for body worlds and we began looking and turning on the air conditioning turning on the systems making the escalators work we realized this building is in a lot better shape than we had assumed
4376392 and so we said why dont we see if we can do it with the money available rather than asking the donors to go above and beyond what the donors have already approved
4376393 you know silicon valley is famous for big businesses starting out in garages apple computer and hewlett packard to name two and so we came up with a garage model
4376394 and guess what we learned a lot over the course of about five years over 500 000 people come to visit the garage

4376400 since we dont know the primary cancer i will have to give a very aggressive chemotherapy and there is no guarantee that your father will survive the chemotherapy
4376401 your father has a strong and stubborn character so he will tend to live longer than half of the prognosis given by a specialist
4376402 i will stabilize your fathers condition and hopefully he will be able to return in a few days
4376403 was a clear message to reorganize my life in such a way i could spend the most time possible with my father in the days after he was diagnosed
4376404 that night father passed away with a smile on his face
4376405 the right of law abiding minorities in our country because they
4376406 boycott food grown by black farmers and subsidise crops grown by whites
4376407 the green party recognises that subsidies are sometimes necessary to protect local regional and national economies and the environment and we will support them in these instances
4376408 controls such as tariff barriers and quotas should be gradually introduced on a national and or regional bloc level with the aim of allowing localities and countries to produce as much of their food goods and services as they can themselves
4376409 britains farming industry will be encouraged to produce a much greater part of the nations need in food products priority will be switched from quantity to quality as we move from competing in a global economy to maximum self sufficiency for britain sustainable agriculture decreased reliance on petro chemical products and more organic production
4376410 to be able to fulfil all our basic food needs locally to grow as many other products as we can to meet our basic needs e g for textiles fuel paper on a local or regional basis to enable all communities to have access to land which can be used for growing for basic needs to ensure that all growing systems use only natural renewable inputs and that all organic waste outputs are able to be recycled back into the soil or water system
4376411 we are the only true green party in britain as only the bnp intends to end mass immigration into britain and thereby remove at a stroke the need for an extra 4 million homes in the green belts of the south east and elsewhere which are required to house the influx of 5 million immigrants expected to enter the country under present trends over the next twenty years
4376412 stop people from inner cities moving to the countryside to protect traditional lifestyles and prevent crime forbid the purchase of corner shops by migrants
4376413 communities and regions should have the right to restrict inward migration when one or more of the following conditions are satisfied 11 a the ecology of the recipient area would be significantly adversely affected by in comers to the detriment of the wider community eg national parks antarctica b the recipient area is owned or controlled by indigenous peoples eg australian aboriginal people whose traditional lifestyle would be adversely affected by in comers c the prospective migrants have on average equal or greater economic power than the residents of the recipient area and they or their families were not forced to leave the area in the recent past
4376414 regions or communities must have the right to reject specific individuals on grounds of public safety
4376415 right of all peoples to self determination and that must include the indigenous peoples of these islands
4376416 it persists because of the failure of the organisation openly and adequately to recognise and address its existence and causes by policy example and leadership

4376418 for most of human history the existence of such ethnic and cultural diversity among humanity was so obvious and apparently unchallengeably natural that the political theorists and philosophers of past generations simply took it for granted only in the last few decades has this been changed forever by the advent of mass passenger travel the insatiable desire of the globalised capitalist economy for cheap labour and the worldwide reach of us consumerist culture through film and television
4376419 that poison is in large measure the blind economic force of global capitalism with its insistence on the unrestricted flow of goods capital and labour to wherever in the world they will make the maximum short term profit it is not about love and tolerance it is about profit
4376420 formidably powerful and publicly unaccountable transnational companies are becoming ever more footloose their strength and mobility facilitated both by technological advances and by the progressive withdrawal of investment controls by governments and by multilateral institutions such as wto tncs are now increasingly able to exploit differences in social and environmental standards between countries in order to maximise profits
4376421 the rush towards globalisation is neither inevitable nor desirable it is leading to the sharp reduction in powers of local and indigenous communities states and even nations to control their futures as economic power is transferred to global institutions a worldwide homogenization of diverse local and indigenous cultures social and economic forms as well as values and living patterns increasingly reflect the new global monoculture
4376422 long years ago we made a tryst with destiny and now the time comes when we will redeem our pledge not wholly or in full measure but very substantially at the stroke of the midnight hour when the world sleeps india will awake to life and freedom a moment comes which comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance we end today a period of ill fortune and india discovers herself again

4376426 i think by any measure its been a really good fire season
4376427 what were looking at is probably something that wed categorize as a less than normal fire season
4376428 weve been able to catch them small and keep them small
4376429 weve had a fair amount of activity but weve been fortunate with the weather and weve been real fortunate with the lack of lightning for the summer
4376430 weve had very very few man caused fires too which has been very helpful
4376431 so its not that we havent had a fair amount of initial attack activity
4376432 weve just had enough well timed moisture as well as late spring early summer moisture that has limited the fire behavior
4376433 we had places that were green in the state that havent been green in 10 years

4376446 if there is no agreement on the government in zimbabwe the president will not attend the summit

4376449 we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq of course future decisions will be based as i have always said on the advice of our military commanders on the ground
4376450 but just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch we would expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009
4376451 although it is hoped that the uk military presence in iraq will decrease significantly in the future it is still too early to discuss the size and shape of a reduced uk forces footprint
4376452 in his statement to the house of commons on july 22 the prime minister set out our intent to make a fundamental change to the uk mission in iraq in the first months of 2009
4376453 as ever this will be based on conditions on the ground the plans of our coalition partners and the military contribution requested of us by the government of iraq under a long term bilateral relationship
4376454 as a key coalition partner the us is intimately involved with the development of our future plans
4376455 there is absolutely no logic and objectivity in the move
4376456 its totally uncalled for totally not based on any logic
4376457 we are happy that the world now has an idea of how the regime is vindictive
4376458 there are three key sticking issues and we hope that those three key sticking issues will be resolved
4376459 i think that if all of us are open and objective and put zimbabwe first they shouldnt take time to resolve

4376627 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4376628 we obviously need to tighten up our defence if we could but i was very pleased to win
4376629 the most encouraging thing is they wanted to carry on with the game every single time there was a free kick they went to play it quickly
4376630 it is very easy to sit here and be full of praise for the opponents if you have won if you think you have done okay but their spirit was commendable

4376646 the war set the stage for a more comprehensive middle east conflict
4376647 it set into motion a dynamic in the arab world where much of the arab street believes that hezbollah won that war and there is tremendous expectation on hezbollah to continue the struggle
4376648 we destroyed all of hezbollahs infrastructure much of its civilian headquarters we killed about a quarter of their fighters that is a prohibitive number of casualties for any modern fighting force and yet perception is everything in the middle east and the perception was in the arab world at least that israel was bested in that conflict

4376687 for the last year he cant put a foot wrong anyway but hes not taking anything for granted and i think the more the bowls the more confidence and belief he gets in himself hes got a really bright future if he stays away from injuries
4376688 his bowling was missed a little bit in the last test but thats the sort of impact he can make
4376689 hes following very much in the footsteps of shaun pollock and allan donald and its great for south african cricket if he stays fit for a long time i think hes going to do very well
4376690 he hits the ball really well and only needs to get half a bat on it and it will normally clear the ropes hes just a really good striker of the ball
4376691 his bowling is probably not where it can be but hes a dangerous batter down the order and theres no total that is safe even if were a few down and he comes in

4376751 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4376752 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4376753 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4376754 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4376755 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4376756 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4376762 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4376763 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4376764 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4376765 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4376766 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4376767 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4376768 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4376769 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4376770 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4376771 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4376772 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

4376781 a broad multiclass multiracial movement is converging around obamas hope change and unity campaign because they see in it the thrilling opportunity to end 30 years of ultra right rule and move the nation forward with a progressive movement
4376782 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
4376783 they should vacate the land and the authorities get ways of compensating them as the law requires
4376784 more people than ever before are getting into and staying in treatment drug related deaths are down and the level of drug fuelled crime has fallen substantially
4376785 in order to maintain its position on prohibition the government has to show that all drug use is dangerous
4376786 we need legal control and regulation of drug use that is how we manage use of alcohol and we need the same for drugs
4376787 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4376788 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4376789 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4376790 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4376791 otherwise people would begin to call into question his ability to run the country and accuse him of being spineless
4376792 the political process can always be looked at either through a telescope or a microscope
4376793 if you look up close of course much is changing but if you take the longer view it turns out that the system was totalitarian and continues to be totalitarian
4376794 the left hand trait is really impressive for how fluid secure and precise it is
4376795 despite all the perplexity that it may cause also regarding the lack of information on its provenance the work is at least for now the most important find since the identification of the lady with an ermine
4376796 there were only very few artists of that caliber then
4376797 there are collectors who keep these works of art in bank vaults but it is likely that well find others
4376798 we know of artworks that have been documented and that we havent found yet
4376799 the key issue is that the city needs to be open to the public
4376800 its clear the ordinance is trying to get rid of unsightly homeless folks who are sitting on benches
4376801 were far more concerned about public safety and law and order than free speech
4376802 the point is you dont want anyone to hog the bench
4376803 phutt phutt try to blow off the candles and he use his hand do the cut cake things and said
4376804 there are still the occasional reports of children in the uk who die from complications of measles these children have usually not been immunised
4376805 nationally measles cases are increasing this is probably due to the decrease in immunisation against measles following the mmr scare an overwhelming weight of evidence proves that the mmr is safe we do not advocate the single vaccines which are less safe
4376806 measles is preventable we urge parents to ensure their children are immunised with the mmr vaccine at the appropriate time at 12 to 15 months then again at three to five years
4376807 two of the recent cases in east cambridgeshire had to be admitted to hospital for a couple of days to be nursed and they needed help measles will take you ill will take you to hospital and then it could take you through to death
4376808 we only bother to protect against diseases which are dangerous
4376809 i think it should remain voluntary in the us they do have a system where children need to be vaccinated to begin school and this leaves lots of them having it done just before going to school rather than at the necessary ages this leaves them more vulnerable for longer that is not to say children shouldnt have it though
4376810 some of those in east cambridgeshire who contracted the disease in july were above the age of 18 if you havent had the vaccination you could catch it at any age
4376811 there are so many stories and tales being banded about that sometimes you dont know what to believe
4376812 some health professionals believe its the best thing for your children then you hear from other people that its not and its an important decision to make
4376813 i think given the success rate of the mmr vaccine in a number of parts of the uk its obviously a very sensible and prudent method in making sure you take early prevention
4376814 i would obviously understand some peoples concerns but i think the evidence currently available says there are no suspect outcomes which would suggest having the vaccine is anything other than a sensible precaution
4376815 my resignation had nothing to do with the fact that i did not get that post i was protesting the manner in which our constitutional process is consistently being manipulated
4376816 i felt hurt that my boss saw an opportunity but did not support me he has always not been supportive it pains all this is happening under his leadership he must take full responsibility i think he has full knowledge of the constitutional breaches in fdc
4376817 i became curious when fdc officials claimed that the national council could not fill the post of chairman yet the post of the chief electoral commissioner was filled by nec when maj rubaramira ruranga resigned recently
4376818 why was the same article not good enough to be used to fill the post of the chairman in my interpretation this amounts to selective application of the constitution i cannot stand that
4376819 the fact that kassiano and alaso were mps they were ineligible and i was the only suitable candidate at the time can you believe that kasiano was the mover of the motion to amend the constitution
4376820 i can not see the party i have worked for playing games with the constitution it has happened twice against me in favour of other people
4376821 the attorney general says we should be patient and keep in touch with his office
4376822 and for the next two months there will be no money in the judiciarys coffers to cater for us
4376823 no one can employ us because they think we are spies some of our colleagues have died while others are stuck upcountry without money

4376872 they have to leave the shelter because we actually invited them at a time of need we think enough has been done to do that

4376878 on the eve of tisha bav the serious question is raised whether we should take the opportunity and ascend to the temple mount as it stands empty inviting us to build our dream house on it
4376879 infiltration of inciting material calling for the obliteration of al aqsa in all synagogues in israel
4376880 with the goal of expressing the yearning for something else on the temple mount
4376881 it is no secret that the state and the nation of israel have an arrow pointing in one direction building a third temple at the expense of the al aqsa mosque
4376882 just today i along with members of the movement took a tour and we were exposed to shocking maps and documents signed by official israeli bodies detailed plans for the construction of synagogues on the western side of the temple mount as if they were public yards are seen there
4376883 in my opinion and in the opinion of all muslims the temple mount is a mosque and we do not recognize anything else being planned to be built there
4376884 jews throughout the world hope for a day in which the al aqsa mosque will actually be obliterated from the temple mount and not just by means of photoshop software
4376885 until we screened in palestine it didnt feel like we were finished yet
4376886 over 4000 people came out to nablus to see the show i couldnt get the gaza rappers out for the screening and i couldnt get into gaza myself the shows in ramallah and jenin were awesome
4376887 i was in gaza in 2003 for the first hip hop show there ever we just decided to make a movie
4376888 i didnt know anything about filmmaking and there were lots of production problems i didnt even bother reading the manual before i picked up the camera we were working on graphics and the sound right up to sundance
4376889 but basically i paid for the film on my credit cards
4376890 even in the production i left cameras with dam and abeer and pr i wanted the film to speak with their voices as much as possible
4376891 they did start getting impatient after a couple of years it was hard to convince them that taking a bit of extra time would make it that much better
4376892 but they were very loyal to me plenty of other filmmakers approached them in those years but they told them no jackie will make the first movie they even turned down al jazeera thats a big sacrifice
4376893 what really changed dams music was the second intifada thats when they released meen irhabi the intifada made the zionist rapper worse he sings death to arabs you never hear palestinian rappers singing death to jews
4376894 i have so much respect for their integrity coca cola is a big player in israel and they approached dam about doing an ad for them they offered them a lot of money but the guys told them no you hear about that and you realize these guys really have principals even though theyre broke
4376895 the hip hop is different in different parts of palestine in gaza its harder to have shows because its more religious even though all the rappers believe in god yet it took off there more than anywhere else
4376896 taking images and placing them next to each other and setting them to music that all comes pretty naturally to me when i heard sundance wanted to screen it and i had no idea what it meant
4376897 people have told me that slingshot is the first palestine film theyve seen that doesnt make them depressed
4376898 were all on the left here so youre just preaching to the choir

4376901 a woman walked into an exhibition that had one of my gumball machines
4376902 she put in a quarter and one of my rings dropped out she came back with a roll of quarters and kept feeding them in one after the other
4376903 i asked her what are you doing i was a little irritated i guess because a lot of time and energy goes into each one of those items she told me i just liked to collect rings
4376904 i dont think my work is going to change the world that people will want to overthrow israel after seeing my film but if im going to work it has to be meaningful with slingshot i also want to help the artists
4376905 one of the problems palestinians face is how theyre represented in the media that means we have to make different media media is our strongest weapon i think
4376906 i dont want to make anything longer than three minutes

4376922 this may seem like an unimportant thing to some but for the union its vital for large companies that union officials be allowed to consult and carry out union business

4376927 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4376928 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4376929 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4376930 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4376931 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4376932 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4376933 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4376934 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach

4376940 despite all the perplexity that it may cause also regarding the lack of information on its provenance the work is at least for now the most important find since the identification of the lady with an ermine
4376941 there were only very few artists of that caliber then
4376942 there are collectors who keep these works of art in bank vaults but it is likely that well find others
4376943 we know of artworks that have been documented and that we havent found yet
4376944 you need to fix things early and that requires a certain level of disclosure for the developers
4376945 you also dont need to make a big production out of it
4376946 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4376947 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4376948 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4376949 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4376950 otherwise people would begin to call into question his ability to run the country and accuse him of being spineless
4376951 the political process can always be looked at either through a telescope or a microscope
4376952 if you look up close of course much is changing but if you take the longer view it turns out that the system was totalitarian and continues to be totalitarian

4376962 the two athletes have attended international sports competitions before and im sure the information is correct
4376963 we heard these rumors and we immediately wrote to the chinese gymnastics federation
4376964 they immediately sent a copy of the passport showing the age and everything is o k thats all we can check
4376965 as long as we have no official complaint there is no reason to act if we get a passport that obviously is in order
4376966 if they say theyre good were going to beat them
4376967 you cant worry about it you do your job and you expect other people are doing theirs and you expect its a fair field of play

4376971 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
4376972 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
4376973 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
4376974 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
4376975 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
4376976 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
4376977 the position i finished in is well above the position i am in the world
4376978 unfortunately the chinese shooter was in front of me so i had to wait every time after he shot before the noise died down
4376979 i am not using this as an excuse but i dont have much opportunity to practice in front of a crowd of 10 000
4376980 but i have learnt a lot today it proves you can teach an old dog new tricks
4376981 i did not have any problems with the ossetians who lived near us we sometimes worked on farms together but these men who came began insulting us and saying that we were georgian and we should not be there my eldest son is 24 and they kept asking where he was and i told them he was in tbilisi
4376982 there were about 10 of them and a few were not ossetian i could tell by the accent some of them were drunk
4376983 they took everything and they said they were going to take the car my wife started arguing saying how can we go such a long way on foot
4376984 they pushed us with the barrels of their rifles and then one of them opened fire and she was hit in the stomach one of the men then drove us to tskhinvali my wife was bleeding very heavily then he dumped us from the car
4376985 my wife died there we waited for two days and then set off again now the children cry all the time i feel very sad about what has happened but i am also afraid because i know we are not safe

4376990 i knew that was a hard double for ryan i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4376991 i felt really relaxed out there kept the nerves in check and tried not to do anything stupid and just bided my time

4376996 its a super interesting paper in the sense that its addressing something thats part of our everyday lives
4376997 but its hard to believe theres a chemical in these moisturizers that acts as a carcinogen the way cigarettes do
4376998 moisturizing creams and other cosmetics actually have no toxicology testing requirements
4376999 many of the cosmetics companies used to do extensive testing to protect their customers
4377000 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4377001 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems

4377008 edaw is an idea driven firm whether the idea comes from science planning or design the distinguishing quality in a democratic design and planning environment is its ability to push its people toward the powerful profound ideas and to stave off complacency the best idea wins

4377025 we will screw them in the same way that we screwed the arabs
4377026 as a nation their primitivism is on high record its education is on the border of ignorance they have no ability to receive any spiritual teaching this is a lower level from what we saw in the arabs they lack any roots in judaism and are totally bound to the games of the wild instinct they posses unsocial elements chronic laziness and hatred of work

4377034 effectively gives permission to abcs producers to copy the underlying premise of a show without licensing the format
4377035 frapa and the international tv production industry have waited in vain for abc and or disney to respond to howard davines memo which if authentic is unacceptable both creatively and commercially
4377036 frapa believes in and fights for the intellectual property of formats frapa believes that formats belong to the people who create them and that they should not be used unlawfully by any third party even one as powerful as abc
4377037 in frapas view davines memo can be seen to be encouraging abc producers and show runners not to licence formats honestly
4377038 if this is found to be the case frapa will do everything in its power to help protect the property of its members in the international creative community
4377039 if abc and disney refuse to repudiate the contents of the davine memo then producers in both the us and around the world might note their silence and help themselves to the underlying premise of hannah montana
4377040 producers might even be persuaded by mr davines memo to be inspired by the general underlying premise of a well known disney cartoon character in the spirit of the memo the rip off rodent might be called tricky mouse
4377041 what is often overlooked or not fully appreciated are the complexities associated with negotiating format deals coupled with the fact that often times what is appealing in the format may be nothing more than a general underlying premise which in and of itself may be no reason to license the underlying property
4377042 the drc does have jurisdiction to determine the appropriate sanction and or order for compensation mutu is not entitled to object to fifa jurisdiction
4377043 not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs have on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area chelsea is delighted

4377052 we have 40 games left so its out there for the taking
4377053 weve got six more with boston and six more with tampa bay and tampa bay just had some big injuries its there for us if we go out and play well see what we can make out of this race
4377054 we would have loved to have played better but we didnt
4377055 weve dug ourselves a hole and now we have to work our way out of it to be honest when we get to friday im not going to be thinking about what happened on the road trip
4377056 i know weve had a lot of issues but everybody else has too

4377059 here at opus dei despite all the rumors we are much less interested in self immolation and the sewing of painful spikes into the insides of your underwear and far more interested in leveraged buyouts and carefully planned upticks in shareholder valuation
4377060 in other words what people dont know is we turn our adherents into devout hard nosed businesspersons placing them in the highest positions of power in large corporations where they toil deep into the night in the name of jesus preparing briefings and presentations and financial reports
4377061 naturally turning anyone into a cold corporate drone in the name of god quickly defeats all sexual urges as it effortlessly annihilates the soul and replaces it with this chalky gray powder that looks like scorched flowers and tastes like sadness
4377062 dude dont get me wrong maiden is completely awesome and old motorhead blows my mind hell even early def leppard totally rocks but there is simply no comparison to the masters of all british metal you know

4377068 these cats are being left to die it is very inhumane
4377069 people dont want to keep cats in beijing any more so they abandon them or send them to the compounds
4377070 when we went inside we saw about 70 cats being kept in cages stacked one on top of the other in two tiny rooms
4377071 disease spreads quickly among them and they die slowly in agony and distress the government wont even do the cats the kindness of giving them lethal injections when they become sick they just wait for them to die
4377072 it is the abandoned pets that suffer the most and die the soonest they relied so much on their owners that they cant cope with the new environment
4377073 most refuse to eat or drink and get sick more quickly than the feral cats
4377074 we do not believe any of the cats that go in there survive
4377075 we have tried to negotiate with the government to stop the round ups and to introduce cut price neutering services so that people can afford to keep their pets but they wont listen to us
4377076 they are not thinking about the cats they just want to get results in the quickest way possible by clearing as many cats from the city as they can
4377077 if i dont take them in the government will kill them
4377078 people believe what the government tells them and that is why they are abandoning more and more family pets
4377079 he didnt like dogs so he decided to have dogs killed but there was a bad reaction from the foreign media and they were pressured to stop
4377080 now they have stopped killing dogs but the new victims are cats it is all connected to the olympics
4377081 when women get pregnant the doctor will ask them if they have a cat in the house
4377082 if they reply yes they tell them you must get rid of it it will be bad for the baby
4377083 i keep all the cats in my house and 100 of them sleep in my bedroom at night i am too frightened to let them out if they go outside they will be taken away and killed
4377084 the government is not telling people the truth look at me i live with them 24 hours a day seven days a week and i am very healthy
4377085 there are no cats here go away no one is allowed inside unless you have official permission
4377086 we did it out of love for the children we were worried the cats might harm them these six cats had been hanging around the kindergarten looking for food
4377087 so three male teachers put out plates of tuna in cages for bait trapped the cats and then beat them to death with sticks
4377088 we were very worried the children might try to stroke them and that the cats might scratch them or pass on diseases we had to get rid of the cats and this was the only way to do it
4377089 we understand that with the olympic games the beijing government is eager to show the world the city in a good light
4377090 but capturing and dealing with cats in such an inhumane way will seriously tarnish the image of beijing and the games
4377091 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4377092 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4377093 this government has no chance of establishing trust with georgians

4377138 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4377139 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4377140 we saw this transaction and its terms as an attractive opportunity to further simplify our structure and to better position us to create future growth
4377141 thus we have reduced our sales expectations for the balance of 2008 to account for these uncertainties and we are taking a measured approach for our 2009 development as we seek to deploy our capital in the most effective way

4377151 fsngx has been in our portfolio since october of 2007
4377152 and despite the recent slide the fund is still up 2 52 for a one year period ending august 11
4377153 natural gas prices typically soften in summer when demand for the fuel for heating is negligible
4377154 but theres probably more than just that behind the recent price plunge
4377155 obviously this is a volatile fund full of fits and starts
4377156 halfway through 2008 fidelity select natural gas was poised to deliver 40 or greater returns for the year as it did in 2007 2005 and 2004
4377157 but the downturn in natural gas prices during the last few weeks made that questionable
4377158 mcelligotts overweighted of e amp p stocks and underweighted stocks of firms exposed to natural gas and oil refining marketing and transportation
4377159 with energy prices and demand for greener power high more and more north american electric utilities will shift from coal fired generation to natural gas generation driving up demand
4377160 more industrial and electric generation consumers could rely on natural gas if prices stay low lifting demand
4377161 fsngx is an extremely volatile fund measured by its three year standard deviation of 27 50 which is second only to fidelity select gold in volatility
4377162 the fund is also capable of deep slides and should be treated as such as a niche holding

4377165 the general gathering together in which by correlated actions of the without and the within of the earth the totality of thinking units and thinking forces are engaged the aggregation in a single block of a mankind whose fragments weld together and interpenetrate before our eyes in spite of indeed in proportion to their efforts to separate all this becomes intelligible from top to bottom as soon as we perceive it as the natural culmination of a cosmic process of organisation which has never varied since those remote ages when our planet was young
4377166 represents the largest single photovoltaic commitment from an electric utility anywhere in the world

4377191 it seemed to me that the essence of our civilisation hung in the balance as one by one those values by which i thought we were defined freedom of the individual habeas corpus the right to privacy the right to jury trial came under attack from our own governments little did i expect that the very mode of response our opera manifest destiny could provoke a reaction that would directly confront us with these new legal problems
4377192 the writer dic edwards and the composer keith burstein presented a complex view of the motivations ambitions and doubts of those attracted to suicide bombing
4377193 unsurprisingly burstein took the reviewer to mean that he was glorifying terrorists and thus once the terrorism act 2006 came into force at risk of prosecution should the opera be revived
4377194 we referred to a composer as being accused of promoting terrorism we should have made clear that this was the meaning the composer keith burstein ascribed to a review of his opera the court of appeal did not accept that the review conveyed this meaning and ruled that this conclusion could be reached only by a strained interpretation

4377207 it will be the peoples decision if they want to go back to their homes we will not push them
4377208 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control and it would ratify their continuing engagement with the military force until everything is worked out but it doesnt say that the forces will be replaced
4377209 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4377210 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4377211 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4377212 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4377213 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4377214 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished

4377226 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4377227 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4377228 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently

4377269 you have to take your own situation and decide whats best for your own family just because everyone else is doing it doesnt mean its the right thing in fact it probably means it isnt
4377270 why is it today that parents just dont get it
4377271 even though intellectually they know that less than 4 percent of all high school varsity athletes in this country will go on to play division i ii or iii college sports in this country parents hear that stat all the time but they say yeah but my kids going to be the next michael jordan or the next mia hamm but thats not the way its going to be
4377272 theres really no reason to their lives are organized enough and were not getting our kids involved to put them on the fast track to becoming college athletes that shouldnt even be part of the equation until they are 13 or 14
4377273 victims of burnout boredom a lack of talent or even more sadly a pushy parent
4377274 if the child shows an interest you would certainly want to encourage that interest
4377275 when the demands of a sport exceed a childs cognitive and physical development the child may develop feelings of failure and frustration
4377276 emphasize playfulness experimentation and exploration of a wide variety of movement experiences
4377277 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4377278 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4377279 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4377280 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4377281 otherwise people would begin to call into question his ability to run the country and accuse him of being spineless
4377282 the political process can always be looked at either through a telescope or a microscope
4377283 if you look up close of course much is changing but if you take the longer view it turns out that the system was totalitarian and continues to be totalitarian
4377284 look hes fallen but he wont take his hand off the sandwich
4377285 those rainy days they aint so bad when youre the king
4377286 the truth can can be told is not the eternal truth
4377287 i guess that has been kind of a constant theme throughout my career
4377288 ive never really been in the limelight but thats not something i need im just constantly working to get better i cant control what goes on in the media what people want to say about me i think coming in as a walk on ive had a different perspective people want to make a big deal out of the recruiting rankings with four star and five star whatever you were coming in as a walk on my perspective has been to disregard all of that the guys with the hype it doesnt matter to me until you show me what you can do on the field i dont get caught up in the hype im just always competing with myself pushing myself to get better and be the best i can be thats all i can worry about
4377289 i cant worry about what anybody else is saying i just have to go after my goals no matter what is going on around me
4377290 obviously weve upped our talent level with the addition of kavario
4377291 were definitely stepping up our game as a group this camp compared to any other time ive been here
4377292 me and senior walt winter have been taking a leadership role and trying to step up our games and that has a ripple effect on everybody kavario chris romeo savant everyones looking great right now im real proud of all of them
4377293 i think coach willingham is turning it around i know washington is going to turn things around
4377294 we try to get them as much information as possible so that they can make a very informed and accurate decision based on all of the stuff thats needed for him to be processed
4377295 therefore we do have a hand in getting them information and assisting with that
4377296 we enlist the support of his high school and any of the people who have information and can help us calculate what has taken place
4377297 the professional developers conference pdc on 27 october and the windows hardware engineering conference winhec the following week both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4377298 this blog will provide context over the next 2 months with regular posts about the behind the scenes development of the release and continue through the release of the product
4377299 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows
4377300 we promise and will deliver such a dialogue with this blog
4377301 pc tools is a global leader in innovative software products designed to protect the privacy and security of windows computer users
4377302 you can be paying plenty of attention to security but if you have to give a partner access to your server farm and their security posture does not match our own prepare for disappointment
4377303 companies like services that mine data about who clicked on your website are a risk
4377304 they are a marketing company they do not have awareness of security a lot of people do not think about that when they partner up
4377305 a methodology to keep these problems from happening we put the partners into sandboxes so they cannot get access to anything we think we are pretty good at putting people into boxes there is not much damage they can do
4377306 our goal is to build something that can last another ten years
4377307 heavily multithreaded and takes advantage of current hardware feature after feature reflects modern computing it is architected to run continuously inline at high speeds
4377308 new unpacker architecture to unpack binary files that contain malware
4377309 putting in protection feature and working on new logical processing engine
4377310 endorsed by more retired admirals and generals than barack obama has military donors
4377311 both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4377312 mainly to open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4377313 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4377314 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4377315 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted material
4377316 copyright licences are designed to support the right to exclude money damages alone do not support or enforce that right
4377317 the choice to exact consideration in the form of compliance with the open source requirements of disclosure and explanation of changes rather than as a dollar denominated fee is entitled to no less legal recognition indeed because a calculation of damages is inherently speculative these types of licence restrictions might well be rendered meaningless absent the ability to enforce through injunctive relief
4377318 the court has held that free licences such as the creative commons or cc licences set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work
4377319 when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the gpl general public license and all cc licences put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licences which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the licence
4377320 the gpl is another example of a licence that depends on copyright law for enforcement because its a copyright licence not a contract although this model train case is about a different licence because the us is a legal system based in part on case law every decision matters
4377321 because japan was an isolated island for so long there is so much that is unique about our culture
4377322 i want japanese to be proud of our traditions to understand that something japanese can be just as fashionable as something from the west
4377323 you pick up an ipod and it emanates california cool just as bang amp olufsen products feel very scandinavian
4377324 what you see coming out of japan now are designs that will be loved because they have a feeling of japanese ness
4377325 for my parents generation cool meant something was from the west
4377326 i hate to say it but hello kitty was a sign of an immature country
4377327 its not just foreigners who didnt understand what it meant for something to be japanese
4377328 many young japanese think that a hamburger is a japanese thing we need to promote real japanese culture at home and abroad
4377329 over the past five years foreigners have really begun to appreciate sake
4377330 japanese food is seen as healthy and sake has ridden that trend
4377331 when i grew up everyone was going to work for banks or trading companies
4377332 but i thought i want to create a symbol of japan thats hip but also draws from our society
4377333 the great thing is that tofu is seen as cool in places like the u s
4377334 we know that japans not isolated anymore and that all countries are interconnected
4377335 in that context i think its important to display our nationalism and say this is what makes japan different from other places
4377336 because of the circumstances of my childhood i never fell in love with the west like many other japanese did
4377337 my inspiration comes from our traditional culture in which everything even a little clump of grass is divine
4377338 for a long time flowers were seen just as something beautiful not a necessity
4377339 but the relationship between humans and nature between humans and flowers i think its something we need to stay alive we dont have to only make things that are useful we can create things that give us happiness and have a sense of spirituality
4377340 a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

4377352 a strategy based on 20 per cent 50 per cent or 80 per cent co2 emission reduction is doomed to failure
4377353 the real merit is that we can actually reduce the cost of the backsheet compared to conventional petroleum based backsheet
4377354 im proud of nastia she had the better day she worked hard and she deserves it
4377355 i worked so hard for so many years for this i dont know what to say
4377356 it made me feel a little more nervous but i felt pretty confident
4377357 it doesnt matter where i came from valeri said after his daughters victory
4377358 i am very proud to win for my country and this is a feeling that i dont think any father can describe

4377394 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere
4377395 i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of j and k in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state
4377396 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming
4377397 will continue to do work with them and support their networks
4377398 i remember him telling me back in the day that if you wanted to know real estate youve got to hang out with real estate investors if you wanted to know sports youve got to hang out with athletes i wanted to know tv so i hung out with bob and learned the tv game from one of the
4377399 im feeling better patricia but im thirsty for your blood
4377400 hi olivia what a cute polkadot outfit you are wearing today for visiting with your auntie cheryl
4377401 ill just be a minute baby i have to answer this call
4377402 i cant talk right now marvin ill call you later my favorite baby is over for milk and cookies
4377403 the way i figure it i am a blood relative to these two red outfitted girls so these photos are gonna count
4377404 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
4377405 kita mengambil latar belakang itu karena kita ingin kembali ke uud 1945
4377406 kami hari ini akan langsung ke yogya untuk menemui pak andaryoko besok kami akan temui beliau
4377407 tell me who is the prophet talking about himself or some other
4377408 i dont think it sends a negative message if we sell berbatov as we sold robbie keane this summer
4377409 were fighting on all fronts to have the most successful campaign we can
4377410 the quest to have more medals than spitz will be something very important
4377411 and hes keeping the attention of the public he is a great athlete
4377412 ill be 32 the next time lots of young guys out there will be shooting at these spots in four years
4377413 it was the hardest thing ive been through in my athletic career
4377414 i couldnt stop smiling in the pregame got out there hit some people
4377415 he made a nice cut i made a nice tackle
4377416 i love to go back there i love the coaching staff its fun
4377417 this would be a unique opportunity not just to offer softball at the school but for the school as well
4377418 we finally got enough girls to commit to the sport
4377419 its grandview were trying to expand every year were trying to get our girls sports programs going
4377420 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4377421 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4377422 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4377423 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4377424 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4377425 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4377426 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4377427 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage
4377428 that im in this olympics is because of my mom and dad
4377429 i came away from that tour totally loving the sport
4377430 i want to be standing in paris after finishing a tour de france someday
4377431 i have a pretty high expectation of myself and i think i can do that with the right legs for me itll be cool to be part of the olympic experience
4377432 i feel like the schedule was definitely a lot tougher than i thought it would be doing it twice
4377433 im just proud of winning three medals would have hoped for it to go a little bit better but you really cant stick your nose up at three olympic medals
4377434 yeah it was pretty painful my body kind of shut down at the 500
4377435 i did the best i could in the situation i tried to put my hand on the wall but it wasnt good enough
4377436 im not sure why or how but she trained really well leading up to it i guess this will be a big learning experience for her shes someone who when she has something like this you can guarantee shes going to be better next time
4377437 she did a heck of a job here for us
4377438 the question is always going to be whether she bit off more than she could chew but the bottom line is she was the best person in all the events we put her in we wouldnt have done it any other way
4377439 definitely i keep saying that the mental energy and emotional energy and physical energy that it takes to go out there and get up every time even for a prelim you have to put in some kind of effort even michael its just incredible
4377440 hes swimming even more than i swam hes doing it in world record time gold medals it definitely gives me a lot more respect even more than i already had for him
4377441 i think michael is doing what hes doing and its incredible but it kind of makes the rest of us look like if you dont win a gold medal its not you know i even got a best time in the 200 free and i didnt medal its tough but obviously michael gets our sport out there and thats great
4377442 my heart really goes out to katie shes an awesome girl
4377443 i think shes probably feeling what im feeling you know how much hard work you put into this and the olympics are it its like the wimbledon or the pga of our sport shes human we all make mistakes and we learn from them shes so young and such a great ambassador for her country shes going to go on to great things and looking back its going to be a great learning experience for her
4377444 i think the level of competition has risen a lot higher since the games started
4377445 ill just go back to the drawing board and try to work on my weaknesses and try to get better
4377446 i just have to always put in perspective as far as me personally and think ok silver medal two bronze im moving up in the world its better than last time and im not close to being done
4377447 being green is a special thing because we have a beautiful facility
4377448 if you watch hee haw that little cabin they used to stand in front of weve been given that cabin
4377449 were going to have bluegrass music there each night played off an antique flatbed truck
4377450 it would be over a 1 million ride in todays market
4377451 but its been restored with its lights on its one of the most beautiful rides youll ever see
4377452 and we indulge in things we probably only eat once or twice a year and thats ok its special and its part of the ambience of the whole thing

4377467 welcome page where exactly that is and how to put the file there depends on your web server software
4377468 there is a difference between weakness and sin sin is a conscious act that violates gods law and sinners often desire to hide or mask their sins from others weaknesses are not choices but are hallowed gifts from god and thus they are not sins god given weaknesses do not require repentance since they are gifts to help us humbly rely on god and love and assist others fortunately the atonement is always available for you and me when we depend upon him because of our sins and weaknesses thus our weaknesses become another important way for us to rely upon the lords atonement throughout our lives
4377469 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4377470 i proved that i played with the best tonight and it couldnt have happened to me on a better stage
4377471 i missed some key shots that i probably shouldnt have missed that was that
4377472 not much i could do about it so it was definitely a surprise result for me
4377473 she came in the same day rocsi went out and he had already issued the statement that they were separated apparently she went over there and got into the fight shes now in the hospital
4377474 the sub story is that he has been under investigation because 57 million dollars is missing from our government they froze all of his bank accounts hes getting a separation because he cant afford to get a divorce
4377475 last night lisaraye her cousin phillip travis and her publicist lynn jeter assaulted the guard at the premiers home proceeded to ransack the house and then assaulted the premier and his sister
4377476 it is public knowledge that the couple has been separated for months and lisaraye has no lawful right to be in the residence her conduct yesterday clearly contradicts her stated commitment to dissolve the marriage amicably
4377477 it is with great sadness that i have to announce that my husband and i have separated last night wednesday august 13 2008 an attempt was made by and on behalf of my husband to first prevent my entry into our home and then later to make me leave our home by force it was necessary for me to receive medical treatment for injuries suffered and in relation to those injuries i shall continue to assist the police force with its enquiries whilst it is my sincere wish to avoid unnecessary conflict i shall not be intimidated nor shall those individuals whose job it is to protect and represent me i ask that my privacy be respected in these difficult times and i believe that the people of the tci will understand and support my wish to receive the necessary independent representation from the legal counsel of my choosing i hope that in time the tci government will come to share that view although i have always been a supportive wife even in light of the very serious allegations currently pending against the premier there are limits even for me i continue to have the utmost respect for the people of the tci who have always shown me kindness and support i vow to continue my work amongst the people of turks and caicos islands until recently i had hoped that i would be able to continue to assist my husband during what will undoubtedly be difficult times ahead for him i do not wish to have to add to his difficulties
4377478 i was just as shocked about hearing about it as anyone and everyone else but just as any wifes position would be in such an allegation as this it has to put a damper on the marriage
4377479 with all thats happening with michael the rape and the corruption allegations and his ill behavior even this weekend for our recent music festival i think hes just spiraling out of control i will just continue to be uplifting and i will pray for him
4377480 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery
4377481 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4377482 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4377483 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4377484 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4377485 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4377486 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4377487 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4377488 when you feel youre hearts guarded and you see the breaks started and when the clouds have all departed youll be right here with me
4377489 being able to express myself and my journey through my music is a feeling i cant describe

4377492 now in its fifth year the vh1 hip hop honors has come to represent the pinnacle of innovation and achievement in hip hop music
4377493 this years five honorees are no different and are being recognized for their significant contributions to hip hop culture and for helping to elevate hip hop into a truly global phenomenon
4377494 its not just music for the united states its world music
4377495 im touching so many different kinds of people on this album as well as keeping my core fan base at the same time
4377496 its totally given me a new energy a new everything
4377497 when you have a lot of stress and negativity around you when you cut that away you cleanse im starting over basically
4377498 i want people to say its a breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
4377499 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
4377500 this is an in depth detailed examination thats beyond what has been broadcast in terms of these typical type of biographies

4377505 not much i could do about it so it was definitely a surprise result for me
4377506 he gave us a declaration for 80 and they found 12 000 and the cigars
4377507 i have a fear of banks so i keep cash in my house and i grabbed the wrong box i took it into the country and out the cigars well i should have smoked them before i left
4377508 hes filed papers and within the next few weeks ill probably get it back
4377509 apparently a black man with dreads cant carry that much cash but i think there are a few worse things to be embarrassed about i havent cheated on my wife like some in the news
4377510 after the semi finals my coach just asked me to strive for a better result in the final rather than setting a goal for me to win the gold medal
4377511 i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
4377512 full credit to alain he swam a great race and really worked on my weaknesses i was maybe caught into swimming other peoples races
4377513 this is probably one of the bigger rollercoaster rides ive had in my career
4377514 the noncompetitive nonadvertised aspect is questionable as is whos managing the consultant
4377515 this question of whos in charge is a fundamental problem in the public sector
4377516 rather than the esdc saying heres my list of approved consultants
4377517 american institute of certified planners aicp code of ethics and professional conduct by not upholding the planners responsibility to the public as the primary responsibility of ethical behavior
4377518 could be consecutive when there is an implicit warranty that travels with the work
4377519 but should the state put itself in a position where it cant hire the best firm
4377520 is regarded as the premier environmental consulting firm in the new york metropolitan area
4377521 public agencies do have rules in this case the relevant rule being advertising and competitive bidding they should be required to follow those rules when theyre making an exception they should explain in public why theyre doing it
4377522 from an interest account funded by forest city for esdcs out of pocket costs including consultants
4377523 the out of pocket did that also cover staff expenses as well

4377539 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4377540 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4377541 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4377542 its being said that its a little hot here so the final decision will be made after the 10 000
4377543 if it had to be a foreigner couldnt it have been a german
4377544 my experience of managers in england was not that positive unfortunately at nottingham forest i had two different managers whom i would call typical old fashioned english managers
4377545 there is not a good reputation for old fashioned british coaches except for bobby robson because of his personality if you look around there are simply not that many of them abroad
4377546 with no disrespect they were more like socialisers hanging out with the lads but now things have changed i think steve mcclaren can do a good job
4377547 he was interested in the passion and succeeded really well in bringing some of that back
4377548 i always wanted to work abroad to experience different countries
4377549 holland has always been a respected football country in england they produce good footballers and good coaches i am only six weeks here but now i know why you can see why holland has a conveyer belt of talent
4377550 that is in the past i am not worried about my image i know what i have done in the past and this is a new adventure for me
4377551 i am not proving anything although maybe i am proving to myself i am one of those coaches who can travel abroad
4377552 i am trying to learn dutch but my priority is learning the football
4377553 i have put a lot of pressure on myself coming here for me it is no different managing fc twente to managing england or to managing middlesbrough there is always pressure and everyone is always looking at you to deliver results

4377583 um ehrlich zu sein habe ich zwischen den rennen ziemlich viel zeit damit verbracht die daten zu studieren und mich fit zu halten die sommerpause hat mir die m glichkeit gegeben etwas abstand zu gewinnen und meine batterien aufzuladen
4377584 wenn ich die bisherige saison revue passieren lasse dann f hlt sich das wie eine komplett andere meisterschaft an als das im vorjahr der fall war 2007 war sehr hart und konstanz war unglaublich wichtig in diesem jahr sind die resultate bei allen unterschiedlich und jeder rennsieger hat mindestens an zwei auftritten keine punkte geholt
4377585 das hat es nat rlich umso wichtiger gemacht gute ergebnisse einzufahren konstanz wird aber wieder ein thema werden vor allem da wir ja nun dem ende der saison zustreben
4377586 wir haben unser team 2007 in der stadt vorgestellt und ich habe auf dem circuit ricardo tormo schon getestet die stadt ist mir also nicht fremd
4377587 es ndert allerdings nicht viel an meinen vorbereitungen wenn wir an eine neue strecke kommen wir sitzen alle im selben boot also gehe ich die geschichte nicht unbedingt anders an nat rlich haben wir uns im vorfeld des rennens im mclaren technology centre darauf vorbereitet aber unser hauptaugenmerk gilt trotz allem den drei freien trainingssessions vor dem qualifying
4377588 ich werde eng mit meinen ingenieuren zusammenarbeiten damit wir sicherstellen k nnen das wochenende mit einer guten basis zu beginnen dann wollen wir uns im laufe der zeit weiter verbessern
4377589 ich mag es sehr neue rennstrecken zu besuchen und freue mich schon richtig darauf am freitag ins cockpit zu steigen
4377590 ich mache nur ungern vorhersagen das rennen in ungarn hat wieder einmal demonstriert wie unvorhersehbar die formel 1 sein kann und das ist einer der gr nde warum sie ein so faszinierender sport ist
4377591 nat rlich befinde ich mich noch immer in einer guten position in der weltmeisterschaft und das bleibt auch mein ziel
4377592 das wichtigste ist jetzt konstant in die punkte zu fahren
4377593 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4377594 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4377595 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4377596 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4377597 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4377598 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4377599 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4377600 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4377601 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4377602 i think i can get over missing a little bit of school for something like this
4377603 this has been so much better than i ever expected
4377604 this week is just one of those once in a lifetime experiences and were having so much fun here
4377605 we have above average pitching and our defense has been real solid
4377606 a lot of the teams at this level sometimes dont handle the pressure all that well
4377607 our girls have been handling that pressure and also weve been trying to apply the pressure by stealing bases and just putting the ball in play and its been working for us
4377608 we kind of see how they are loosening up and usually dont decide the starter until about two hours before the game
4377609 with the day off thursday we have all our pitchers eligible to use for the semis so it really worked to our advantage
4377610 we came pretty close it was kind of a tease for us last year
4377611 we knew we wanted to get to this level this year and now that were here everyone is so positive
4377612 het is opmerkelijk dat we eigenlijk zo weinig weten over een dier dat onder zo veel druk staat door overbevissing illegale visserij en overschrijding van de vangstquota
4377613 dankzij dit project komen we meer te weten over de migratiestromen waardoor we beter in staat zijn om herstelprogrammas op te stellen

4377616 months of political deadlock have finally come to an end
4377617 the alliance has made it certain prachanda will become prime minister as theyll easily get the 298 votes needed for a simple majority

4377621 being judge and jury is not a principle that any reasonable individual or reasonable institution would subscribe to
4377622 why should pennsylvania founded by the english become a colony of aliens who will shortly be so numerous as to germanize us instead of our anglifying them
4377623 in large sections of the country the native american will entirely disappear he will not intermarry with inferior races and he cannot compete in the sweat shop and in the street trench with the newcomers
4377624 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
4377625 mijn plan was om al in de eerste 50 meter het verschil te maken en dat is prima gelukt
4377626 what was incredible was when the storm erupted in the stands bocog beijing organizing committee olympic games had over 30 people out there with sponges and rags they had extra dirt for the field
4377627 we came back after the first delay and they had wiped every seat every counter and had plastic covers on all the computer monitors they were really really prepared for the rain
4377628 for ryan to come back 20 minutes later and almost have us finish 1 2 its a pretty incredible swim
4377629 its an incredible day for him im glad to see him get his first gold its a cool moment and i know hes happy
4377630 when me and michael talk its strictly anything but swimming
4377631 thats good for both of us were not always getting wound up about the olympic thing
4377632 there is no way im going to bad mouth the united states
4377633 everything ive ever had in my life i owe to the united states i didnt have to live through that war i didnt have to sleep in a bunker so im very fortunate
4377634 it would be kind of nice to one day when people speak of michael phelps winning seven gold medals and have lost the opportunity to win eight theyll talk about that guy that took it away from him

4377640 we have adults who do not know how to be parents what makes us think a 14 year old would know
4377641 knowledge of right and wrong and that an individual is responsible for his actions is something we all learn well before the age of 14
4377642 if hes old enough to make a baby hes old enough to suffer the consequences
4377643 i feel badly for the athletes who wont get to use my shots but after tibet i know im right

4377645 if shes talking about it im not hearing it the most feminist thing shes done is tell women to vote for her
4377646 well its fair game to judge her for standing by someone who lied to her and disgraced the office
4377647 its not fair to blame the victim for her husbands actions
4377648 i dont think any of us are in a position to judge other peoples marriages its such an intimate and personal relationship
4377649 my thoughts and prayers are with the edwards family today and thats all ive got to say

4377664 as an ordinary tax payer i dont want to receive any demand letter from the government
4377665 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4377666 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4377667 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4377668 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4377669 its hard enough to contain a species once it makes its way into nonnative waters
4377670 when each mud snail has the ability to produce large quantities of embryos without a partner youve really got a problem
4377671 where theyve gotten into streams in the western part of the country theyve caused a lot of problems
4377672 theyre taking over space that should have other native species living in it
4377673 i could sum it up in one word nothing the permit doesnt change a thing
4377674 i dont really have a whole lot to say right now
4377675 were moving forward its positive maybe by the end of the day well have a feel for better things negotiations are ongoing
4377676 we have things to work out but were not there
4377677 i think everyone has a pretty good feeling about it but i dont want to say more than that
4377678 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4377679 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4377680 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4377681 i was kind of expecting the bunt sign with nos 8 and 9 coming up but he let me swing
4377682 i was kind of happy i wanted to show that i could come up big in that situation and he gave me a pitch to hit it worked out in my favor
4377683 why am i going to bunt with the no 8 hitter to get to the no 9 guy then im going to put scott up there for perez who is one of the toughest lefties
4377684 no i did not think about it he was not bunting there it sure looked like they thought we were going to bunt but were not going to
4377685 montanez has shown patience hes swinging at strikes hes hitting the ball hard the other way hes gotten some big hits for us
4377686 with the lefties swinging the bat with melvin mora has been doing a great job its basically pick your poison its a very balanced lineup a very solid lineup without the big names one through nine its done a great job
4377687 that was the big out in the game the one that cherry got
4377688 its nothing you can control and its going to happen so theres no real reason to get all huffy about it
4377689 ive had a great time this year i see a lot of future in this team i left an organization in tampa that has gotten good id hate to leave this place and see them get good as well
4377690 the preliminary stuff i got is they just want to shut him down for a while
4377691 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4377692 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4377693 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4377694 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4377695 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4377696 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4377697 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4377698 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4377699 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4377700 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4377701 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4377702 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4377703 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4377704 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4377705 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4377706 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4377707 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4377708 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4377709 matt and robby took care of me and told me how to conduct myself as a professional i was fortunate to have those guys take a liking to me
4377710 its a weird situation because there are so many of them
4377711 some have done well and some havent and thats what youll see at times theyll be overmatched its not easy because its hard to judge talent at the big league level theres been a pretty big turnover of guys who could maybe play here they have to realize this is their opportunity to show what they can do
4377712 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4377713 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4377714 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4377715 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4377716 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4377717 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4377718 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4377719 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4377720 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4377721 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4377722 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4377723 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4377724 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4377725 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4377726 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4377727 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4377728 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4377729 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4377730 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4377731 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4377732 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4377733 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4377734 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4377735 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4377736 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4377737 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4377738 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4377739 that will now over the course of the next week go out to ballot across all of the firms sites across the uk
4377740 our members will be asked whether they want to buy in to the enhancements we have negotiated
4377741 in the meantime the action we had proposed will be suspended until we have a ballot result
4377742 an improvement in relation to where we were last week
4377743 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4377744 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4377745 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4377746 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4377747 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4377748 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4377749 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4377750 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4377751 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4377752 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4377753 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4377754 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4377755 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4377756 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4377757 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4377758 1 in 6 americans will be a victim of identity theft this year alone
4377759 repudiamos la presencia en calidad de invitado oficial en nuestro pa s del violador daniel ortega saavedra que por 20 a os esclaviz sexualmente a la hija de su esposa
4377760 its hard enough to contain a species once it makes its way into nonnative waters
4377761 when each mud snail has the ability to produce large quantities of embryos without a partner youve really got a problem
4377762 where theyve gotten into streams in the western part of the country theyve caused a lot of problems
4377763 theyre taking over space that should have other native species living in it
4377764 i could sum it up in one word nothing the permit doesnt change a thing
4377765 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4377766 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4377767 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4377768 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4377769 otherwise people would begin to call into question his ability to run the country and accuse him of being spineless
4377770 the political process can always be looked at either through a telescope or a microscope
4377771 if you look up close of course much is changing but if you take the longer view it turns out that the system was totalitarian and continues to be totalitarian
4377772 this year we hope to send an indian spacecraft chandrayan to the moon it will be an important milestone in the development of our space programme
4377773 the recent blasts in our embassy have cast a shadow over our efforts to normalize relations with pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region i have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the government of pakistan
4377774 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4377775 the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world we must defeat them
4377776 all over the world there is growing realization of the importance of atomic energy to meet the challenge of energy security and climate change
4377777 it is a clean environmental friendly and renewable source of energy
4377778 the nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries will end indias nuclear isolation
4377779 it will open up new opportunities for trade in dual use high technologies and nuclear materials and equipment opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialization of our country
4377780 it will enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers our artisans our traders and our industry
4377781 but there are handicaps which have adversely affected our atomic energy programme we have inadequate production of uranium the quality of our uranium resources is not comparable to those of other producers
4377782 many countries have imposed sanctions on trade with india in nuclear materials nuclear equipment and nuclear technology as a result our nuclear energy programme has suffered
4377783 debe conjurar la amenaza de un ataque de misiles proveniente de oriente pr ximo y bajo ning n concepto est dirigido contra rusia
4377784 it is a political event but it is also a national event that has an impact on the city of philadelphia i mean im going to work
4377785 he has tried to present himself as a guy who took taxpayer dollars very seriously and would only use them in the proper way
4377786 theres no reason why hes got to turn to taxpayer dollars to bring his pals to the convention
4377787 the rest of us will be there performing our duties
4377788 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4377789 feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
4377790 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states
4377791 the one thing you really have to do as a nominee is establish your dominance over the party
4377792 people want to see the presidential nominee controlling the convention
4377793 in the interest of being gracious and avoiding the alienation of the clinton people they basically folded
4377794 reluctantly conceded it was safer than having these people walk away from denver disgruntled
4377795 how do you handle this so you dont offend people who dont like the clintons
4377796 on the other hand you dont want to offend the clinton supporters
4377797 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4377798 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4377799 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4377800 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4377801 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4377802 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4377803 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4377804 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4377805 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4377806 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4377807 im not sure what he was trying to do i think it was a trial balloon
4377808 we hope sen mccain picks someone of his own ideological stripe a pro life running mate
4377809 from a political point of view having a little bit of a rebellion on the right at the republican convention and showing that streak of independence for moderates it wouldnt be so bad
4377810 tom ridge would make a fine vice president and it certainly would help mccain in pennsylvania
4377811 long term the worst thing a company can do is start taking out hr jobs because of the recession
4377812 the message it sends to the business at large if they move hr is that the business is not interested in its people
4377813 im bringing in more business partners to give the business more of what it wants
4377814 if a company director has a team meeting a business partner needs to be there to voice people issues
4377815 ive always believed elected officials should be seen and this is a great way to
4377816 its the place to be seen you come to see old friends and meet new friends
4377817 i wouldnt slam an outhouse door as hard as they slam people in this general assembly
4377818 i couldnt hit a bull in the ass with a banjo
4377819 i wish i were born as smart as you instead of better looking
4377820 he doesnt mince words he says the things that many of us in politics would love to be able to say
4377821 bud is one of the last of the old time politicians who knows how to have fun
4377822 i dont think its homage but id like to think some people are a little grateful
4377823 for the first time in our history we have had four years of nearly 9 percent economic growth india is among the worlds fastest growing economies
4377824 but there are new challenges that we face we have the challenge of inflation i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices
4377825 but while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything that hurts growth
4377826 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 percent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
4377827 there is a new dynamism in our railways new roads are being built many new seaports and airports are being developed
4377828 irrigation watershed development rain fed areas development flood management all received special attention our effort at increasing investment in the rural areas and reducing debt burden of farmers has turned our farm economy around
4377829 we now have had record production of food grain cotton and sugar our warehouses are full again
4377830 now a skill development corp will be created by the government with the active participation of the private sector to give special training to our young men and women our workers and our technicians
4377831 long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state
4377832 issues related to the sacred place especially the issue of providing the best possible facilities to pilgrims can only be resolved in an atmosphere of peace and goodwill
4377833 our government has taken several initiatives to increase public investment in the north east and in jammu and kashmir we are investing in infrastructure and in education in these regions to encourage development and generate employment
4377834 major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country
4377835 we have to further strengthen our intelligence agencies and police forces to deal with the problem of terrorism
4377836 shadow over efforts to normalise relations with pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region
4377837 all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4377838 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world we must defeat them
4377839 the nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries will end indias nuclear isolation it will open up new opportunities for trade in dual use technologies opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialisation of our country
4377840 many countries have imposed sanctions on trade with india in nuclear materials nuclear equipment and nuclear technology as a result our nuclear energy programme has suffered
4377841 the left hand trait is really impressive for how fluid secure and precise it is
4377842 despite all the perplexity that it may cause also regarding the lack of information on its provenance the work is at least for now the most important find since the identification of the lady with an ermine
4377843 there were only very few artists of that caliber then
4377844 there are collectors who keep these works of art in bank vaults but it is likely that well find others
4377845 we know of artworks that have been documented and that we havent found yet
4377846 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4377847 yall do i have to do the splits im a christian
4377848 things starting to unravel a familiar scene for irish fans
4377849 i should be getting ripped to pieces by dogs right now
4377850 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4377851 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4377852 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4377853 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4377854 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4377855 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4377856 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4377865 our investment in lijit comes on the heels of an impressive growth trajectory in 2008 over the past six months the company has tripled the reach of its network doubled its average publisher size and provided measurable value back to those publishers

4377872 sono terrorizzato da te e vorrei che mi lasciassi stare
4377873 i miei amici non hanno visto la vera india e non ci stiamo incontrando in una conferenza nel cuore della vera india
4377874 ho forte fiducia che se unite i vostri cuori non solo le vostre menti e capite il segreto dei messaggi che i saggi uomini doriente ci hanno lasciato e che se veramente diventiamo meritiamo e siamo degni di questo grande messaggio allora capirete facilmente che la conquista delloccidente sar stata completata e che questa conquista sar amata anche dalloccidente stesso
4377875 va multumesc pentru informatia oferita din pacate colegii care s au ocupat de acest site nu au avut simtul raspunderii si ca atare vor suferii consecintele ne cerem scuze pentru situatia creata iar in cursul zilei de maine vom incepe sa remediem greselile
4377876 he obama was right on iraq long when others were jumping into the sea like lemmings and thats hard to do were soldiers and we respect courage
4377877 most of my friends are conservative republicans and they say im voting for barack mccain does not have a lock on the military vote thats for sure
4377878 well complete our duty im deploying next year because its a commitment i made to the nation not to a president but we all know that iraq was a big mistake
4377879 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4377880 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4377881 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4377882 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4377883 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4377884 test cricket must have primacy as far as the ecb is concerned and nothing has changed india have long been aware of our views but here it is not the case it looks like the icc has bowed to bccis money power
4377885 with the champions league final scheduled for the night before the start of the first test in ahmedabad there is a strong possibility that m s dhoni may have to finish a floodlit champions league final for chennai super kings if they make it to the final and rush back to ahmedabad to be in time for the start of the test match the following day
4377886 if dhoni decides to skip either match the prospects of the tv broadcasters filing a law suit were very high
4377887 die chancen f r unternehmer als franchise geber erfolgreich zu expandieren stehen gut

4377889 the companys trading results are currently being helped by the strengthening dollar and were this to continue the results for this year would be positively impacted
4377890 the board is very happy with the companys strong performance so far this year
4377891 we are mindful that the economic climate here and abroad could cause the companys progress to slow as could persistent bouts of poor weather however the board is very happy with the companys strong performance so far this year
4377892 i was hitting him clean and they still werent giving me points they let him have it his own way
4377893 the referee had to pick one or the other he picked the chinese lad but because it was in his backyard he took two points off me as well
4377894 i thought they were very generous to the chinese lad
4377895 you expect a little bit of bias sometimes but you come to the olympics and you expect a level playing field
4377896 the scores make the difference we had our gameplan and it was working but the scoring was stupid and that changed it
4377897 lets see what kind of man he is on my patch
4377898 he is strong and i think he is better than me
4377899 im not particularly happy with my form throughout the competition i thought when i got here id be one of the contenders
4377900 i didnt score the big scores and to win medals youve got to get big scores quickly
4377901 when you fight away from home or your different if you dont get a good start or ko your opponent you have lost wrote
4377902 murray could have opted for the same approach but hes young and his adrenalin was still charging edwards too might wish now he had shown a tad more grace but it isnt easy when you know youve got a case
4377903 will there be a british protest no but it is arguable there should be how else will the situation improve
4377904 the way our coach works he is trying to subdue you sometimes
4377905 i feel like my personality is being squashed down and hidden away i need to get a bit aggressive and get pumped up when i do that i can shoot 10s
4377906 ive got loads and loads of individual medals and you learn from your own mistakes
4377907 maybe if i had gone in there with a bit more aggression there might have been a different outcome
4377908 but i think i thought this is just another step rather than going in thinking this is it winning this one match is all i need to do
4377909 any concerns the archers have and take away from these games we will be reviewing and discussing and looking how we can address those concerns so we are fully prepared for 2012

4377916 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4377917 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4377918 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4377919 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4377920 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4377921 the achievement gap is real its stark its persistent and absolutely must be closed
4377922 we have today a moral imperative a social imperative and an economic imperative to close the achievement gap
4377923 we also set aside a 45 minute workshop every day for students in math and english
4377924 we already know enough about the inequities we must now invest in the resources these children need to succeed in school and ultimately in the workplace
4377925 menos bem esteve marco fortes que participou no lan amento do peso e foi 38 entre 45 concorrentes o atleta do sporting come ou com dois lan amentos nulos e terceira tentativa conseguiu 18 05m bem longe do seu recorde pessoal 20 13m
4377926 this year everything about the economy went haywire and its making it really rough i cant remember anything like this
4377927 the last time we saw a decline like this was in the recession of 1991
4377928 they are not even running in place they are moving backward
4377929 were investing our money in gas and groceries so the extra stuff like clothes and shoes is really a luxury
4377930 now that the tidal surge in energy and other commodity costs is showing unmistakable signs of turning up in consumer prices at large the fed finds itself pushed further into the corner
4377931 the recent report on retail sales coupled with todays report indicates that a dip in real consumer spending is now underway
4377932 indicates that jobs remain hard to find and that labor demand is soft
4377933 that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both sen obamas and sen clintons names will be placed in nomination
4377934 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4377935 that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both sen obamas and sen clintons names will be placed in nomination
4377936 put the middle class ahead of corporate interests end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas cut taxes for working families and make energy independence an urgent national priority
4377937 bent on reasserting russian influence in the region and perhaps the world
4377938 theres no place in the 21st century for this kind of aggressive behavior toward fledgling democracies
4377939 the nation inflicted significant damage and pain on many countries especially on people in asian countries
4377940 here i express on behalf of the nation deep remorse and humble condolences for all of the people who fell victim
4377941 face up to history and refrain from making the foolish mistake of repeating the unfortunate past again today
4377942 i prayed for the souls of those who offered their lives for the country to rest in peace
4377943 its nonsense that neither prime minister fukuda nor the emperor are paying homage
4377944 i have my doubts about a shrine honouring the military
4377945 i wonder if those paying homage here really understand the meaning of war
4377946 the ceaseless visits to yasukuni shrine in japan are a total negation of the japanese history of aggression and crimes
4377947 dit waren eigenlijk twee relatief makkelijke bezoekjes geen grote problemen gelukkig soms is dat anders en dan ben ik echt aan het trainen met hond en cli nt ik probeer altijd om goed te luisteren naar mijn cli nten en om in een ongedwongen sfeer te werken daar zijn we immers allemaal het meeste bij gebaat
4377948 a shocking indictment of labours failure to tackle the scourge of drugs
4377949 drugs to flow in through our porous borders and tied our police up in red tape
4377950 the high quality drug treatment that is being provided is the most effective way of reducing illegal drug misuse improving the physical and mental health of drug users as well as reducing the harm they cause to themselves and society
4377951 it is possible that sen clinton having had her name submitted would use the occasion to release her delegates to obama depending on how the roll call is staged clintons released delegates could put obama over the top
4377952 fearless of the future unheeding of our individual fates with unflinching hearts and undimmed eyes we stand at armageddon and we battle for the lord
4377953 into the human cauldron that was boiling all around me
4377954 kita cermati lalu kita akan lihat apakah bisa ditindak lanjuti atau tidak karena ini fakta baru tentu harus didalami terlebih dahulu
4377955 jadi kita amankan semuanyalah yang paling penting polisi itu statusnya sebagai aparat penegak hukum yang harus netral

4377964 en zo goed was ze niet dat was in haar volgende ronde wel te zien
4377965 het enige goede aan die wedstrijd was de 0 0 einduitslag dat is niet slecht voor een europese uitwedstrijd
4377966 we stelden met zijn allen teleur we hebben ons best gedaan maar dat was niet genoeg zaterdag zullen we beter spelen
4377967 had information that a tro was being prepared which implies that there is leakage somewhere
4377968 it is his and his brothers name and reputation that is at stake here which is more important
4377969 there should be a written report followed by the decision
4377970 it is not true that there was no air force chopper that arrived the chopper was available but the weather condition did not allow the chopper to evacuate the wounded

4378046 the decision of a competition watch dog that has lost its way
4378047 investors will take a clear message from this decision the commission having shown that it cannot control telstras market power has decided to punish competitors investors in competitive telecommunications can expect to receive minimal protection for their investment from the accc but will be expected to dip their hands into their pockets to invest more if they want to continue to provide services
4378048 sets two profound and disturbing precedents that are also strongly at odds with the commission approach from the past
4378049 the accc has broken new ground by removing regulation in locations where there is not competing end to end infrastructure the accc has in the past only removed wholesale access requirements in telstra network elements where there are several alternatives that completely bypass telstra such as on interstate transmission and fibre rich cbds
4378050 the accc has for the first time removed regulation because there is insufficient competition in the past it has assessed whether competition is strong and sustainable and if so whether it can be relied on to protect consumer interests in this case the commission has adopted a controversial new faith that it will make competitors invest more if they want to stay in business

4378175 i went to pray with them last night i just basically tried to console them
4378176 she stood on the rock and she was told several times to come off the rock because she was getting too close to the water
4378177 they were still grieving they are still praying for her
4378178 at this point in time because of the time thats passed its more a recovery as opposed to a rescue

4378183 there is a great deal of excitement in the quantum condensed matter community about the iron pnictides
4378184 for more than 20 years our perspective was limited to cuprates and it is hoped that this new class of materials will help us understand the mechanism for high temperature superconductivity
4378185 precisely how this happens is one of the challenging questions in strongly correlated electron systems
4378186 but even though we dont know the precise mechanism we are still able to make some general predictions about the behavior of pnictides and weve suggested a number of experiments that can test these predictions

4378205 we already know that furin seems to have roles in a variety of human diseases such as cancer cystic fibrosis and infectious diseases
4378206 these findings show that having no furin in certain immune system cells can increase the immune response and lead to autoimmune disease in mice
4378207 inhibiting furin has been thought to reduce growth of malignant cells or to block infections by preventing essential activation of a pathogen
4378208 however these results suggest that the development of drug interventions could have an unexpected side effect of increasing the risk of developing autoimmune disease

4378256 wabash college is proud of the mark our alumni make in the world the excellence of student engagement with faculty and the quality of teaching and learning on campus
4378257 any evaluation can only tell part of the story of the excellence of wabash or any college but we are pleased that our success has led forbes to rank us among the top colleges in the country a position in which those who know us best have always placed wabash
4378258 its an impressive fact they rank us 12th of all colleges and universities in the country
4378259 there is so much hype about other schools whove earned their reputation based on sports teams or their graduate school or maybe a highly established faculty that undergraduates may never meet or have in the classroom
4378260 these rankings get at the substance and value of an undergraduate education it says a lot when wabash is coming in way ahead of so many institutions including many of the ivy league schools
4378261 several relatively unknown schools do surprisingly well in our rankings wabash college a tiny all male school located in crawfordsville ind ranks 12th on our list and centre college a highly regarded liberal arts school in danville ky ranks 13th with an entering class of just 250 freshmen wabash benefits from both high student satisfaction with their courses and lots of graduates who received distinctions in their post collegiate careers
4378262 the best reason to choose wabash is the colleges emphasis on the individual
4378263 if there is something that isnt available to me in the core curriculum i have opportunities to expand on them in other ways through college its a hands on approach that allows undergrads to do work that is normally reserved for graduate students
4378264 i think what this speaks to is the ability of wabash professors to find synergy in their teaching and their research that is they can be productive partly because what we produce is informed by classroom discussions and classroom work with our students which of course helps in both directions of education in the classroom and faculty productivity

4378268 our investigation revealed that ubs had knowledge that a market collapse was looming but did not disclose that information to the new hampshire higher education loan corp
4378269 we will vigorously defend ourselves against this complaint as we believe that we worked in the best interests of our investor and issuer clients this complaint attempts to link a single client interaction with overall market conditions which affected all student loan issuers and as such we believe there is no basis for these specific allegations
4378270 their goal should be to figure out how to get student loans out
4378271 given that we have been in discussions with them and the new hampshire corporation regarding the unique issues being raised by the state

4378302 i sent a press release to cross rhythms about recording the album and from hull with love was the headline they gave the news story it grew on me wed just gone through the floods earlier in the year and i wanted to let the world know that we were doing fine and that god had great plans for this city hull is an awesome place that has had much bad press but i love the fact that god takes the foolish things of the world to confound the wise
4378303 my parents werent christians but they sent me to sunday school every sunday where i was introduced to the bible and the wonderful stories of jesus my parents looked after old people so we moved around the country quite a lot which meant i went to many secondary schools resulting in poor exam results i sang in church choirs as i got older and developed a love for singing i spent many hours singing into the hairbrush in front of the mirror dreaming i would one day sing for a living my debut came at the age of 17 when i was invited to sing with a band no one knew that i could sing i got up on stage and all the practicing paid off
4378304 i loved it but i was always so nervous and had one position that i stood in i never moved when i moved to la i sang at the bla bla caf a club that keith green used to play in the late 70s it was all a good experience and training ground
4378305 i had moved there to further my singing career and in the process met my husband it was whilst we were preparing for our wedding that we got saved together id long since given up singing as i was disillusioned with the whole music business thing
4378306 i had always said i would never sing again unless god wanted me to i began to sense a resurrection of that desire but i wanted to be sure it was god and not me so i didnt rush into anything id gone to a conference one particular weekend and god spoke to me in a prophetic word very directly about leading me step by step as id prayed that i had no idea where to start the rest just unfolded in time
4378307 recording honesty was the fruition of a dream in 2001 my husband was made redundant and was out of work for nine months hed been given a good redundancy package and that provided the funds for me to record id previously had a song on one of the re leased cds recorded by db studios in lincoln it was here that i met the producers dan bowater and howard williams i was also on the worship academy course so chris bowater was a real encouragement to me in pursuing my dreams my favourite song on honesty has to be my prayer it was a very simple song that id written in my car as i was praying for my friends and family who werent saved i thought it would be a very simple arrangement on the album but when howard showed me what he intended to do with it i was blown away it really captures the heart of the song it was a wonderful time recording it
4378308 two reasons really the first was after honesty we moved to new life and spent some time settling in and finding our place the other was purely financial i prayed for the green light and got it last december the recording for from hull with love was a wonderful experience jarrod cooper introduced me to andy green who produced jarrods king of kings majesty album we clicked straight way andy and his wife wendy are not just technically excellent but they have that prophetic edge which i wanted more of on this project he knew where i was coming from and the arrangements were amazing leaving me space to worship spontaneously we recorded it over a period of three months using andy and wendy dan wheeler my friend agnes and myself
4378309 i wrote this last year in the summer id decided to take a year off from grapevine as its so easy to become so used to the platform that you forget what its like to receive i also felt that i needed to lay some things down and was thinking and praying this through when this song came it took a while to write and i think i re wrote the chorus three times this song seems to break something when we sing it at new life incidentally this song was picked up for grapevine this year
4378310 this is the song i wrote for hull it came out of an intercessory prayer meeting its just a cry from the heart for god to move here in my city we recorded the gospel choir here at new life they came and joined with our choir and it was an incredible evening they all went off into separate rooms to practise their parts and then came back together and when they sang it sent shivers down the spine very moving and powerful
4378311 id love nothing more than to have the time to be more focussed and to be connecting with people i am a pastor at new life too and being available is an important part of that i want to continue to teach and train worship teams and to be growing in my writing to be really close to gods heart to hear his heart for my life his church and his kingdom my biggest dream though is to see the kc stadium here in hull full to overflowing with people worshipping jesus as they realise that this isnt the forgotten city it has been gods hidden city

4378337 saya kira target pertumbuhan ekonomi sebesar 6 2 persen dan tingkat inflasi 6 5 persen terlalu optimistis karena kondisi ekonomi global yang masih belum menentu ditambah lagi dari sisi domestik terjadi pelemahan daya beli masyarakat
4378338 kalau kerja pemerintah masih sama seperti yang lalu lalu realisasi investasi infrstrukrur rendah saya kira akan sulit mencapai pertumbuhan ekonomi 6 2 persen
4378339 karena itu pemerintah harus bekerja ekstra keras mencapai pertumbuhan ekonomi itu melalui realisasi investasi dan peningkatan pendapatan masyarakat

4378355 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation

4378359 even with respect to facebook users the beacon program did not obtain any consent prior to the communication of identifying transactional information to facebook
4378360 i think facebook is still trying to make beacon work and the roots of what they are doing make sense
4378361 but if people keep thinking that their privacy is being violated facebook has to listen to its users because without users there will be no facebook
4378362 its a digital breath of fresh air and facebook needs to be held accountable
4378363 the lawsuit and public outrage over beacon forced facebook to backpedal on its plans but the fact of the matter is that facebook is a black data collection box

4378378 before 1978 umno members were mainly teachers who fought for the well being of the malays but later when corporate figures joined the party the situation changed
4378379 this is a political gambit it is difficult to anticipate because anything can happen just like the leadership transition it is not the party tradition but it has become a practice
4378380 from my observation the people are worried about umno during my visit to pahang and terengganu recently those whom i met expressed their concern although the emotion has somewhat tapered off
4378381 this is after pak lah prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi announced that he will hand over power emotions subsided when the people heard that there is going to be a muqabalah face to face interaction with pas for the well being of muslims but they are still worried nevertheless
4378382 i think the by election will be a yardstick if anwar wins what would his vote tally be if he garners a bigger majority than before this means that the support for umno is waning
4378383 but if the bn barisan nasional can get more votes than before or better still win the contest there is still hope for umno
4378384 malaysia is now at the crossroads after 50 years of independence we have to deal with challenges which can hinder our progress and leave us lagging behind our neighbours and other developing countries
4378385 that is why we need leaders of calibre who are chosen in a clean and civilised elections
4378386 political instability will drive away foreign investors if this were to happen how can we generate more wealth for the people the nations development will be hindered if the leaders are constantly embroiled in squabbles
4378387 it does not matter whether they are from umno or the opposition the leaders must continue to serve the people and the country this is what the citizens want
4378388 they do not want to see conspiracies money politics and corruption they want transparency a clean and civilised democratic process
4378389 anyone who knows me knows that i have been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years
4378390 andrew young is the father of ms hunters unborn child
4378391 the fact that i am expecting a child is my personal and private business this has no relationship to nor does it involve john edwards in any way andrew young is the father of my unborn child

4378403 people who want to be international athletes they want the limelight
4378404 i think this is a little bit more than we would normally enjoy were kind of quiet people
4378405 i would not trade having katy by my side all the time for anything in the world but i will tell you that it is when the other one is competing it is very difficult to keep your mind on your own game
4378406 granted at this olympics its been a little easier because we dont compete at the same time at world cups it is definitely a challenge when we have to compete on the same day
4378407 you can just watch and cross your fingers and thats all and just wait
4378408 i think just anybody when theyre happy in their personal life that definitely helps them
4378409 depends on the person of course but i think that is a very positive thing
4378410 the left hand trait is really impressive for how fluid secure and precise it is
4378411 despite all the perplexity that it may cause also regarding the lack of information on its provenance the work is at least for now the most important find since the identification of the lady with an ermine
4378412 there were only very few artists of that caliber then

4378422 we all talk to people who talk to people and there are people close to the obama campaign in the course of conversations who made clear to me that there was very high level discussions the obama people expect powell to endorse him
4378423 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama

4378433 opened the public airwaves to free and vigorous discussion of controversial issues by individuals of all political stripes
4378434 bringing back the fairness doctrine would amount to government control over political views expressed on the public airwaves

4378445 i think i can get over missing a little bit of school for something like this
4378446 this has been so much better than i ever expected
4378447 this week is just one of those once in a lifetime experiences and were having so much fun here
4378448 we have above average pitching and our defense has been real solid
4378449 a lot of the teams at this level sometimes dont handle the pressure all that well
4378450 our girls have been handling that pressure and also weve been trying to apply the pressure by stealing bases and just putting the ball in play and its been working for us
4378451 we kind of see how they are loosening up and usually dont decide the starter until about two hours before the game
4378452 with the day off thursday we have all our pitchers eligible to use for the semis so it really worked to our advantage
4378453 we came pretty close it was kind of a tease for us last year
4378454 we knew we wanted to get to this level this year and now that were here everyone is so positive
4378455 i felt a little sluggish the first round but my body is woke up now
4378456 sometimes with matt youve to tell him to slow down a little bit because hes a hammer and everything looks like a nail and sometimes you cant do that

4378462 george bushs administration is promoting interests of candidate john mccain
4378463 defeated by barak obama on all fronts mccain has one last card to play yet the creation of a virtual cold war with russia bush himself did not want a war in south ossetia but his republican party did not leave him any choice
4378464 it should be a convenience store not a government agency
4378465 and its getting deeper every day we import 70 of our oil at a cost of 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oilman all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4378466 in 10 years 5 trillion goes out of the country for oil its nuts its the greatest transfer of wealth from one area to another in the history of the world
4378467 to put it plainly t boone pickens is out to save america

4378490 our economy remains very productive but it shares the gains with only a small slice
4378491 families with the lowest incomes are still suffering the most and continue to lose
4378492 what really matters is expenditures what a household can and does spend
4378493 if bill gatess income goes to zero he could still live a pretty good lifestyle spending his billions
4378494 family income has a big impact on whether you go to college and matters more than it ever did before
4378495 the income gaps are going to get bigger and next generation consequence is really severe
4378496 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4378497 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4378498 the era in which the united states and russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended
4378499 for the territorial integrity of georgia to be respected and the cease fire agreement to be honored
4378500 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4378501 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4378502 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4378503 will reexamine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead

4378526 the dollars continuing uptrend is a key factor depressing commodities in general and triggering heavy sales in gold
4378527 japanese players are dumping their long term positions after breaking through key levels this week the market may be oversold but the market is still in a downward trend
4378528 its still early to say its the end of the super cycle but if the markets continue to fall like they are doing now i am sure many people will be talking about it very soon
4378529 the region around 750 is very important because this is a long term gold uptrend support so if its broken golds really gone
4378530 well have some people targeting 750 but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
4378531 near term support should be around 12 38 then 12 00s
4378532 on a more bearish note we could in fact head all the way down to 11 50s because the long term uptrend seems to be breached as of todays sharp downward movement

4378569 and its obvious that the present government and cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4378570 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty

4378598 to build a positive culture with effective communication we need to first of all get the basics right people need to understand what is expected of them and trust has to be built with their employer the employee has to believe that their employer will provide the workplace and support for them to effectively carry out their role and contribute to the performance of the organisation the role of the employer is that they need to provide a safe physical and psychological environment the workplace must encourage and demonstrate good practice standards and good working practice should be encouraged and this starts with the employer when an employer visibly meets their legal responsibilities and provides effective management this sets the standards for everyone else in the organisation we tend to let culture and communications evolve in our organisations this can work when an organisation is small or new however there comes a point when we must proactively start to drive our culture and communications

4378605 we have no prejudice against the berlusconi government we took the same line during the previous centre left government of romano prodi
4378606 it is the right of citizens to judge the government any government in a free debate
4378607 we are not planning to attack anyone but our partners should clearly understand that the armed forces will be used if necessary to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the russian federation and its allies including on a preventative basis including with the use of nuclear weapons
4378608 military force can and must be used to demonstrate the decisiveness of the top leadership of the country
4378609 what baluyev sky means is the enhanced deterrence doctrine which was created in the united states
4378610 soon we will not be able to maintain missile defense
4378611 under these conditions a potential enemy will gain the ability to carry out high precision strikes coordinated in terms of time and space on practically any target on russian territory
4378612 as for our allies we will see whos ready to join our nuclear umbrella

4378638 we expect a major development in the next 48 hours
4378639 this is science not all predictive experiments are going to work
4378640 what were trying to do is make sure that once it gets there it binds so tightly to the target that it doesnt escape
4378641 we try to make our investments independent of fashion and trends
4378642 we have around 135 000 people who have left their homes there
4378643 we have directed officials in adjoining districts to provide shelter food and health care to the migrating families we are setting up more camps to help these people just like refugees
4378644 weve found that in all the tests they do tend to favour particular limbs which tends to give them a legs and arms sort of layout
4378645 their front two tentacles will be used for a lot of exploratory work and then the ones immediately behind them will then be used also if further investigation is needed
4378646 then the further back you go the more the limbs are used for propulsion and movement
4378647 from what weve seen all the limbs basically have the same capabilities
4378648 with live prey it does help them when sneaking up with the front limbs ready to pounce and using the back ones for propulsion
4378649 they have that facility unlike humans where if we tried to grab our food with our feet we might fail miserably
4378650 the names pretty good and they would have to rename james bond movies
4378651 octopuses do have very strong personalities they do develop their own favourite toys

4378661 sadly again in the last few days there have been a number of suspected heroin overdoses
4378662 to our knowledge there have been eight since august 10 and sadly four of those persons did not recover and died as a result
4378663 it could be there is a harmful item in it that has reacted to them or it could be the quality of the heroin
4378664 it will slow down as by the third generation the trend for larger families will stop
4378665 it will take at least 50 years before we have any sizeable shift change in population but the shift is inevitable and should be celebrated

4378669 we are reviewing the matter and are in discussion with the grantholder all grants awarded by the big lottery fund are monitored throughout their duration to ensure that conditions of grants are met and that money is spent effectively and properly
4378670 if any grant recipient spends funding on something that it was not intended for without prior agreement we have the right to stop payment of the grant and take steps to recover any funding not used for the purpose of the grant
4378671 you couldnt have a starker contrast between the multiple layers of check and balances at cbs and a guy sitting in his living room in his pajamas writing
4378672 the majority of people arrested at large scale cannabis factories in the bradford district are of vietnamese and chinese origin
4378673 the reason behind this is that these factories are being run by organised crime gangs who have links to vietnam and china this is the picture nationally with 41 police forces in the country reporting similar arrests
4378674 we know that residential properties are being used by organised criminals to cultivate cannabis usually these properties are rented and we are encouraging landlords and neighbours to be vigilant
4378675 these cannabis factories are elaborate operations and are not something that can be set up and run in a residential street without them coming to local peoples attention
4378676 two of my staff are on the payroll they have got a tax record and have been with me for around five years but now they say they cant work
4378677 this was how we taught someone a lesson in vietnam
4378678 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4378679 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4378680 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people
4378681 i would see this as very on line with what forster recommended
4378682 he recommended a flatter structure greater performance greater accountability increased transparency and ensuring that the majority of our 8 5 billion budget is directed at clinical services
4378683 this will allow larger and better resourced districts to deliver local health services and important hospital building programs
4378684 more than anything people are saying to me there is confusion and some lack of clarity which can be rectified and there needs to be a decision as to where the accountabilities lie
4378685 waiting lists have continued to grow and not enough new beds have been delivered despite numerous promises rhetoric and now more restructuring
4378686 i saw your collaborative show tonight at the triple door
4378687 you have been found not guilty you are discharged from these proceedings and you are free to go
4378688 you should not have any second thoughts about your decision
4378689 you will never be better informed than you are at this moment
4378690 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4378691 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
4378692 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4378693 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4378694 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4378695 a higher incentive to stand with us now than they did before now that they have seen what the russians have done in georgia
4378696 the united states stands strongly for the territorial integrity of georgia
4378697 paid auto surf program a common term for modern ponzi schemes
4378698 for the latter area the forecast rainfall totals would not ordinarily warrant a warning but given the already saturated conditions rivers there will need watching and slips and local surface flooding are possible
4378699 we will continue to closely monitor rainfall and river levels over the next 48 hours or so
4378700 he is very much a malevolent influence but she wants to remain with him despite him being in custody
4378701 her concern that the baby will grow up without a father seems misplaced he has failed as a father to his other children
4378702 the prime minister helen clark might not have announced the date of the general election yet but new zealanders can now vote for the person they want to be our head of state
4378703 i didnt know him as anything other than a bright eyed bushy tailed guy who wanted to do a good job as an ambulance officer
4378704 i cant think of anything bad to say about him other than that hes shocking at map reading and that was just one job
4378705 the investigation established additional undeclared spending of 1 460 21 however total spending did not exceed the 30 000 threshold the failure to declare the additional spending was explainable and not a criminal act
4378706 i dont think people are too keen to take positions into the weekend mr herring said
4378707 wall street provided a good lead but weve seen spot gold come off oil was a bit weaker overnight and there was a fairly sharp rally in commodity stocks yesterday
4378708 equity traders remain sceptical as overbought commodity prices tumbled through the week on slowing global growth and stronger us dollar he said
4378709 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4378710 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4378711 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4378712 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4378713 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4378714 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4378715 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4378716 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4378717 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
4378718 sony is focused on its vision to bring cutting edge audio technologies to meet the needs of consumer lifestyles
4378719 with the nwz b130f series sony has created a quality all in one music player in a package that marries supreme audio capabilities and compact design which appeal to our youthful audience
4378720 you mean they built another meijer like 3 miles away from here
4378721 it really is one of those situations that is so hard to understand
4378722 she was just outstanding not only extremely competent and rigorous but she had wonderfully warm supportive relationships with all her ugandan colleagues
4378723 ive been getting phone calls and e mails from her old friends in uganda that they are devastated by this tragedy
4378724 shes had a long very dedicated career playing important roles in a wide variety of projects
4378725 to me that was huge to know somebody who had really made a difference in the world
4378726 for a 47 year old woman she really had made waves that influenced a lot of people in a lot of communities all across the world
4378727 every time she came into the gallery she always talked about her girls
4378728 really close to her family a really great mother to her daughters very intelligent and just very caring and really fun
4378729 what one of our ugandan colleagues said was that when ms sullivan was working there her biggest concern was the hazard of traffic on roads in uganda and its just so ironic that she should have died in such an extraordinary accident in her own bedroom in the u s
4378730 the sound was extremely loud and i first thought another building was hit until i smelled smoke
4378731 i was sitting on my sofa watching tv when all of a sudden there was a very loud cracking sound
4378732 oh my gosh ive been up until 12 30 in the morning almost every night
4378733 but we watch it live and record it so we can go back and watch it again later
4378734 its been a long time since a swimmer has been a poster child of the olympics like this
4378735 it really raises the level of awareness about swimming both for the casual lap swimmer and for kids interested in learning to swim but it also increases interest in competitive swimming
4378736 its something that michael said he wanted to do four years ago and hes certainly managed to do that
4378737 its what everybody talks about when they come into the pool
4378738 weve talked about the relay where we beat france and how far michael phelps torpedoes under the water doing dolphin kicks when the rest of the swimmers are already above water and hes still down there looking up at them it just makes people more excited about swimming especially the young ones who are just learning
4378739 i just learned how to dive off the side and im practicing diving off the blocks now
4378740 this year i started to become fast and sometimes when im in a good mood and a happy mood and a confident mood i try to swim fast and good like michael phelps
4378741 usually id be out doing other things playing sports with friends or going to see a movie
4378742 but ive been staying in to watch the olympics just to see michael
4378743 i dont want someone to tell me the next day what happened i want to experience it first
4378744 to know someone just going to the olympics is so absolutely incredible and exciting but this is just hard to explain its so motivational and hes just so michael
4378745 i think the visual of seeing so much excitement about swimming combined with higher summer temperatures it makes people think about having a pool
4378746 this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable kind of activity in china
4378747 everybody in china knows that tibet is an inalienable part of the territory of china
4378748 i see actually most of the people in these demonstrations are non chinese so i would conclude they dont really know very much about the situation
4378749 its only through mutual understanding that we can have peace in the world and we can actually have a better chance of trying to solve issues and not stir up further trouble
4378750 ask me a straight question and ill try and answer it
4378751 i cannot interpret the finding in any other way than this is a deliberate intake because its a substance of importance in that particular sport
4378752 it shows that hopefully the athletes who are here competing are clean
4378753 pr is strong and united to fight out this by election
4378754 these tales on so called pr disunity are fabricated stories straight from bn rumour managers
4378755 when gregor samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin
4378756 its not an action plan there are no maps in this document for example there are no indications of how the transport strategy in the future is going to be linked into land use population growth
4378757 if they were serious we wouldve seen some more macro announcements with dollars committed to looking at the future
4378758 all we have to show for it is a lousy bus network which does not provide the services that are so badly needed
4378759 this announcement today will make no difference to how we do public transport in canberra
4378760 yaitu tuhan yang maha pemurah yang bersemayam di atas arsy
4378761 sesungguhnya tuhan kamu ialah allah yang telah menciptakan langit dan bumi dalam enam masa lalu dia bersemayam di atas arsy
4378762 sesungguhnya tuhan kamu ialah allah yang menciptakan langit dan bumi dalam enam masa kemudian dia bersemayam di atas arsy untuk mengatur segala urusan
4378763 allah lah yang meninggikan langit tanpa tiang sebagaimana yang kamu lihat kemudian dia bersemayam di atas arsy
4378764 yang menciptakan langit dan bumi dan apa yang ada antara keduanya dalam enam masa kemudian dia bersemayam di atas arsy
4378765 allah lah yang menciptakan langit dan bumi dan apa yang ada di antara keduanya dalam enam masa kemudian dia bersemayam di atas arsy
4378766 barangsiapa yang menghendaki kemuliaan maka bagi allah lah kemuliaan itu semuanya kepada nyalah naik perkataan perkataan yang baik dan amal yang saleh dinaikkan nya
4378767 dalil dalil yang semisal dengannya kalau seandainnya dihitung satu persatu maka akan mencapai ribuan dalil
4378768 ketika allah subhanahu wa taala menciptakan makhluk nya allah subhanahu wa taala menuliskan di dalam kitab nya lauh mahfudz yang ada di sisi nya diatas arsy singgasana sesungguhnya rahmat allah mendahului kemurkaan nya
4378769 tidakkah kalian percaya kepadaku sementara aku dalam keadaan beriman kepada yang dilangit
4378770 orang orang yang penyayang mereka itu akan disayang oleh allah tabaaraka wa taala oleh karena itu sayangilah orang orang yang di muka bumi niscaya dzat yang di atas langit akan menyayangi kamu
4378771 barangsiapa yang tidak menyayangi orang yang di muka bumi niscaya tidak akan disayang oleh dzat yang di atas langit
4378772 silih berganti datang kepada kamu malaikat malam dan malaikat siang dan mereka berkumpul pada waktu shalat shubuh dan shalat ashar
4378773 kami tinggalkan mereka dalam keadaan shalat dan kami datang kepada mereka dalam keadaan shalat
4378774 tidak ada seorang salaf pun yang mengingkari bahwa allah bersemayam di atas arsy nya secara hakiki arsy dikhususkan karena ia merupakan makhluk allah yang terbesar para salaf tidak berusaha mengetahui cara kaifiyyah allah bersemayam karena sifat bersemayam itu tidak bisa diketahui hakekatnya imam malik rahimahullah berkata sifat bersemayam itu diketahui maknanya secara bahasa tidak boleh ditanyakan cara allah bersemayam dan pertanyaan tentang cara allah bersemayam merupakan bidah dan ajaran baru
4378775 allah berada di langit sedang ilmu nya berada di mana mana tidak ada satu tempatpun yang kosong dari ilmu nya
4378776 dan sesungguhnya allah di atas arsy nya di atas langit nya
4378777 allah di atas tujuh langit diatas arsy nya sedangkan kekuasaan nya dan ilmu nya berada di tiap tiap tempat
4378778 benar allah di atas arsy nya dan tidak sesuatupun yang tersembunyi dari pengetahuan nya
4378779 tidak ada sesuatupun yang serupa dengan dia dan dialah yang maha mendengar lagi maha melihat
4378780 subhaanakallaahumma wabihamdika asyhadu ala ilaaha illa anta astaghfiruka wa atubu ilaika
4378781 arrow 3 system an advanced model of an arrow interception missile would help israel intercept ballistic missiles in a much wider range than the current model
4378782 israel objected to the development of the sm 3 at the expense of the us funding of the new arrow program as the defense ministry prefers to provide work to israeli industries and because the cost of the new standard is estimated at 10 12 million per missile while the arrow 3 will only cost 1 5 2 million per unit
4378783 the program will be under american supervision and should it turn out that the development is being delayed or is failing to reach its objectives the resources will be shifted to the development of the sm 3
4378784 i dont think we are going to re ignite the cold war
4378785 its just a matter of people sticking their hands up and saying right enough is enough i dont want people to look for excuses
4378786 show some ownership we have underachieved and its time to put it right stop walking around like you have lost your last dollar get out there and score some runs
4378787 im trying to do it the nice way but i keep going back in my mind to what was said to me at times when i first started playing cricket from guys like allan border
4378788 it sometimes made you want to cry you could be made to feel like you were not good enough like you were inadequate maybe its time for harsh words i dont know
4378789 i know that cricketers arent attuned to that sort of behaviour that sort of dressing down but being nicey nicey isnt working
4378790 when because the bits that arent registering on internal scans i am experiencing brainfail i leave work having gaps in my head seems to help with this i am still articulate but there are parts that hold me work having gaps in my head seems to help with this i am still articulate but there are parts that hold me the bits that arent registering on internal scans i leave work having gaps in my head seems to help with this i think because the bits that hold me this i am still articulate but there are
4378791 we will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4378792 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4378793 however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4378794 even in their absence the court believes it has authority to proceed with the case
4378795 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4378796 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
4378797 you have been found not guilty you are discharged from these proceedings and you are free to go
4378798 you should not have any second thoughts about your decision
4378799 you will never be better informed than you are at this moment
4378800 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4378801 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4378802 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people

4378809 i would see this as very on line with what forster recommended
4378810 he recommended a flatter structure greater performance greater accountability increased transparency and ensuring that the majority of our 8 5 billion budget is directed at clinical services
4378811 this will allow larger and better resourced districts to deliver local health services and important hospital building programs
4378812 more than anything people are saying to me there is confusion and some lack of clarity which can be rectified and there needs to be a decision as to where the accountabilities lie
4378813 waiting lists have continued to grow and not enough new beds have been delivered despite numerous promises rhetoric and now more restructuring
4378814 the health minister and his new director general should stop wasting time and tinkering at the edges of the departments organisational structure
4378815 if it was up to me would i subscribe to my own rss feed to read my own blog
4378816 it will be good to go down and see his old friends and family
4378817 at no time did i say that we would have one guy for one game and one the next i said we wouldnt discuss the specifics because i didnt know what they were going to be
4378818 were talking about what gives us the best opportunity to win im still encouraged by all three quarterbacks whats fair is fair to the team
4378819 id prefer different circumstances but ive just got to make the most of it
4378820 that you can be consistent and make the improvements on what happened in the last game and show how youre growing each day in practice
4378821 its a little unique any time i play an nfc north team because i know a lot of the guys personally
4378822 which is easiest for someone your age to buy cigarettes beer
4378823 the prisoners languishing in the prisons of tyrants be it infidels apostates or hypocrites christians or jews or infidels idolater and apostate
4378824 a couple could pretend to be joking before attacking the target
4378825 this would lead to his eyes nose and mouth being plugged and loses the ability to breathe
4378826 this type of weapon is excellent in close combat where fire arms are not desirable

4378829 for fifty bucks id put my face in their soup and blow
4378830 it was a gorgeous meal and they really enjoyed it they were treated to lobster seared island scallops and fillet of aged irish angus
4378831 there were shots of citrus ice and orange jelly a blueberry fool a hot chocolate fondant and petit fours all washed down by fine wines port and champagne it was quite a meal and id say they almost wept as they ate
4378832 i was so disappointed when i saw my final cut i thought if this is as good as i can do at this point i shouldnt be making films
4378833 i went to distributor united artists and said look dont put this out ill make another film no charge
4378834 they thought i was nuts and it was a very very big hit audiences dont have the same criteria i do they say okay you had some grandiose idea and maybe you failed but we like this film

4378859 this settlement isnt an admission its a recognition that life is short
4378860 rather than spend her energy fighting a lawsuit without end she decided shed rather devote her talents and time to making positive change in our society

4378862 i cherish the great people i worked with at apple and i am proud of my contributions to its historic turnaround and current success

4378867 ah well done you gave a perfect little life to this world what a wonderful gift
4378868 die sendung wird vor allem mit viel spa zu tun haben wir haben ganz gezielt die klassischen probleme zwischen hund und herrchen rausgesucht und wollen sie mit einem augenzwinkern darstellen
4378869 mich reizt dass ich mich bei vox wirklich austoben kann es redet mir niemand bei der arbeit rein und ich kann einfach so sein wie ich bin
4378870 ich denke dass grunds tzlich ein hoher bedarf an coaching formaten da ist das thema hund und mensch ist ja eines das gesellschaftlich gesehen immer intensiver wird daher haben diese formate wenn sie nicht dogmatisch sondern mit spa dargestellt werden auch gro e erfolge
4378871 letztlich geht es immer um kommunikationsmissverst ndnisse es ist sehr h ufig so dass die menschen das verhalten eines hundes fehlinterpretieren was zu gro en problemen f hrt
4378872 das mit abstand am schwierigsten zu l sende problem ist das ph nomen angst wenn ich einen hund von seiner angst befreien will braucht er zu 100 prozent vertrauen zu seinen menschen und das braucht eine gewisse zeit wir haben auch so einen fall in der serie dass ein hund nicht auto fahren mag und spannenderweise geht er mit mir ohne probleme ins auto aber mit seinen haltern eben nicht
4378873 es gibt ganz gravierende unterschiede zwischen den hunderassen nehmen wir mal zwei extreme die menschen kaufen sich einen jack russel terrier und haben die hoffnung der hund solle mal etwas ruhe ausstrahlen das funktioniert nat rlich nicht das sind sehr temperamentvolle jagdpassionierte tendenziell aggressive hunde dann kommen die leute und haben einen berner sennenhund und sagen ich m chte aber einen hund mit ganz viel temperament und das sind gro e eher schlafm tzige gem tliche hunde
4378874 ich hatte immer eine gro e affinit t zu hunden und wusste schon fr h dass ich etwas mit hunden zu tun haben will dann habe ich ein jahr in australien verbracht und habe dort mit dingos gearbeitet australischen wildhunden danach war klar dass ich dazu beitragen m chte die missverst ndnisse zwischen hund und halter aufzukl ren es ist f r mich sehr frustrierend wie grob die leute mit ihren hunden umgehen
4378875 ja klar ich glaube dass lehrer in der schule auch sch ler haben die sie mehr und weniger m gen und das ist bei uns hundetrainern sicherlich auch so ich selber habe immer ein faible f r hunde die clever sind bei denen ich merke dass sie immer noch einen plan b in der tasche haben daf r habe ich eine absolute schw che
4378876 ich denke dass es da keinen geheimtrick oder kniff gibt dazu sind hunde viel zu individuell aber im vorfeld ein ganz wichtiger rat informieren sie sich bevor sie einen hund haben viele menschen kaufen sehr naiv und blau ugig einen hund und wissen eigentlich gar nicht was auf sie zu kommt untersch tzen den aufwand untersch tzen das temperament der hunde
4378877 ich w rde sogar noch einen schritt weitergehen ich w rde mir w nschen dass der staat endlich mal so etwas wie einen hundef hrerschein einf hrt denn viele z chter wissen absolut nicht was sie tun ein wochenendseminar w rde schon reichen um die ganz groben anf ngerfehler zu vermeiden
4378878 hunde die bellen bei en nicht kann man ausweiten im sinne von w hrend sie bellen k nnen sie nicht bei en doch direkt danach tun sie das manchmal
4378879 man k nnte sagen ich bin der dieter bohlen von prosieben nur ehrlicher authentischer
4378880 klar werden viele in meinem business berrascht sein dass ich das mache aber ich mache nur sachen die mir spa machen auch wenn ich das letzte f nkchen street credibility dabei verliere so ein schei interessiert mich berhaupt nicht
4378881 ich bin ja nicht einfach zu entertainen aber das hier macht richtig spa
4378882 ich bin derjenige der den m dchen eiskalt sagt was mich an ihnen st rt ich muss doch die wahrheit sagen das ist ja etwas f r die zukunft und bringt sie weiter
4378883 ich finde es sch n junge leute zu inspirieren und gleichzeitig auf dem weg zum popstar zu begleiten
4378884 von der vorarbeit eines songs ber die vorbereitung bevor man auf die b hne geht und die choreographie bis hin zu klamotten und styling all diese sachen habe ich immer selbst in der hand gehabt und das kann ich den m dchen auch mitgeben
4378885 das ist alles ein riesiges abenteuer und ich fiebere extrem mit ich finde es spannend mit den m dchen mehr oder weniger bei null anzufangen und sie aufzubauen

4378887 i cant believe that anyone would take a rabbit like this
4378888 i know people steal things we had a flower pot stolen from the front of the house before now
4378889 nikki is my son tims girlfriend she lives with us she has been unwell recently and she is also worried about her dad who is ill
4378890 so to find this had happened was too much she was very upset
4378891 the hutch has two bolts on the door and they are both quite stiff this could not possibly have been done by an animal it had to be a person
4378892 he would be very easily recognisable because of the sore nose
4378893 he is such a sweet rabbit he is so friendly
4378894 i really cant believe anyone would have done such a thing as to take him
4378895 le comportement de la russie ces derni res semaines a remis en question le dialogue que nous avions construit jusquici et a remis en cause nos relations bilat rales en mati re de s curit mais aussi sa relation avec lotan

4378898 what we reckon now is the operation caused displacement rather than seeing prostitution off altogether
4378899 the displacement is more of a starburst effect its gone to different places but not far out it is still in west reading
4378900 its important to be aware of prostitution but i dont want to stigmatise certain areas
4378901 one of the things that didnt help with operation forthright is western elms was stigmatised i wouldnt like that to happen in other areas
4378902 it was a manageable area now there are pockets of the problem and it is harder to manage
4378903 it was unpleasant the sort of people they were finding there
4378904 prostitution has a devastating effect on the girls and it is important they get help
4378905 they put themselves at risk and we have to see them as potential victims
4378906 we would like to see reports by people affected by it and maybe do a similar operation
4378907 look jane theres that little baby i was telling you about his name is oscar i e some ugly o name
4378908 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4378909 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4378910 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4378911 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4378912 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4378913 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4378914 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4378915 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage
4378916 the new ka is the perfect match for the character of camille adventurous individual and thoroughly modern
4378917 we are delighted that the launch of the film coincides with the launch of such a significant new model for ford of europe

4378919 you are about to read the most important information that is available to you today you will achieve
4378920 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4378921 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4378922 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4378923 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4378924 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4378925 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4378926 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4378927 this is truth listen up everybody and hear what god is saying
4378928 i counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire that you may be rich
4378929 their meetings were not like those of any other political group or party rather they centered on worship and prayer seeking to know the mind of god on the issues that confronted them

4378934 the unitarian side of our family tree tells us that there is only one god one spirit of life one power of love the univeralist side tells us that god is a loving god condemning none of us and valuing the spark of divinity that is in every human being so unitarian universalism stands for one god no one left behind

4378936 the reality is our competitors have real standards to allow students to pass from one grade to another grade and most of our competitors around the world would be ashamed to have the kind of grade inflation that we suffer from
4378937 shes hired some pretty high powered consultants to advise her and put it all together the website will be a registry like for a bridal or shower registry where low income women list things they need for their babies more well off people will then go on and buy stuff for the children
4378938 first off before i point any fingers i personally do want to apologise for the incident that happened at the ozone awards i hope you all dont get the wrong impression of me or my city
4378939 i apologise once again for everything that happened but i cannot apologise for having to defend myself from someone bringing unexpected or un called violence to me and my family at any time
4378940 the fighting within our union is weakening us at the bargaining table we obviously need to chart a new course
4378941 whoever settled anything with war at the moment it seems to be a lot of posturing and the two sides showing each other how big their guns are
4378942 but i hope that the violence can end before any more people are killed
4378943 she is worried about her mum and brother being there
4378944 were so excited we just told the family this past monday they thought it was great news i couldnt hide it any more the second time you show faster
4378945 i point to my belly and tell her theres a baby in my belly
4378946 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4378947 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a paedophile
4378948 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4378949 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4378950 the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4378951 it happened when we were shooting at night and i walked off the set rode a boat on the chao phraya river back to the hotel woke up my wife and our little son kal el and my father in law drove them to the airport and got on a plane to korea with them dropped them off hopped on another plane and flew back to thailand to report to the set that next night

4378960 het team is heel hecht onderling was er nooit strijd zoals je bij sommige arnhemse ploegen ziet
4378961 het spelletje is te leuk om er helemaal mee te stoppen
4378962 ik heb vooraf gezegd dat we het nu ook moesten afmaken
4378963 het liep zoals het hoort we wonnen eigenlijk heel simpel
4378964 ik dacht even het zal toch niet waar zijn maar het was al heel snel weer 2 2 daarna hebben we de wedstrijd gedicteerd sittardia had niets in te brengen
4378965 ze bracht zoveel desillusie teweeg dat niemand bij sittardia meer een strafworp wilde nemen
4378966 onze ingreep heeft zn vruchten afgeworpen sommige speelsters moesten offers brengen die kregen minder speelminuten maar ieder een was zich bewust wat het doel was
4378967 het spreekt vanzelf dat ik heel blij ben dat we niet zijn gedegradeerd dat zou heel zuur zijn geweest en was altijd aan je blijven plakken we hebben bewezen dat we op dit niveau thuisho ren

4378978 the cahuenga building went that a way im an hour late as it is
4378979 one tiny stop julia i have a few things for you at the house
4378980 i seem to recall having already suffered through this lecture somewhere between cocktails three and four

4378982 i happen to like the vine marvelous view fee fi fo fum et cetera et cetera
4378983 three years in los angeles and what do you have to show for it
4378984 another greyhound bus pulls into this town every five minutes
4378985 i cannot believe youre willing to be seen driving this tacky thing
4378986 says she who takes dictation from the man in a powder blue suit
4378987 promise me youre not sleeping with him he wears socks with clocks on them for chrissakes
4378988 of course not i found it in the driveway last week complete with jaunty bow over the hood another little kiss and make up incentive from kenneth
4378989 because i finally have some leverage julia now that ive seen what that plate glass is for
4378990 that he actually thought id go down on him while those appalling creatures moiled around in their own filth
4378991 whereupon you told him he was out of his ever loving mind and stalked out of the room
4378992 look what arrived with my breakfast tray just this morning
4378993 so youll put up with it youre one of the wives now
4378994 and whose job it is to swab down the sheet of glass afterwards
4378995 but i hope to hell its that little shit carstairs
4378996 im not ever going to be goddamn famous now am i
4378997 fame is reserved for those freshfaced little man traps who cant go home on the greyhound
4378998 i prefer that collar and cuffs match thanks ever so
4378999 had we but known at barnard youd end up mooning over some cut rate detective
4379000 or that youd end up playing beard for the man you married
4379001 because carstairs manages to lose every message intended for me
4379002 ive laid out some things for you to try on
4379003 i spent the morning with that little woman at bullocks picking out a few delightful frocks for delivery here in your size allow me that one small pleasure
4379004 and if i should happen to come upon kenneth ogling something untoward above your marital bed
4379005 tiptoe past without making a fuss ill throw in a fur
4379006 and solemnly swear you wont have to kiss my ass for a week
4379007 it gets worse id like to take you up on your offer of a birthday gift after all
4379008 im with kay we need your help with a bit of a situation
4379009 have kay wait for me on the terrace fix her a drink so shell stay put
4379010 come back up here with fresh rags you missed a spot on the glass
4379011 though ill hold off on wishing you any returns of the day
4379012 ive told him to phone kays doctor then the police then her lawyer
4379013 you may have a bit more trouble convincing the detectives
4379014 tell them that the pair of you came by the office before she brought you here that was a little after two i gave you the rest of the afternoon off
4379015 you dont know you called me the moment you found him of course i told you to let me handle it from there
4379016 kenneth keeps some decent scotch in that desk if youd like
4379017 tell me how long youve known about the state of kays marriage
4379018 and how long had she known before confiding in you
4379019 less than an hour she drove straight to my apartment that night
4379020 im happy to report i have no personal experience in that arena
4379021 what do you really think was it kay or was it carstairs
4379022 for gods sake philip can you imagine kay with a hacksaw
4379023 all the more reason it had to be carstairs then
4379024 any proof other than your say so that she hadnt set up camp down the hall
4379025 under the circumstances one might presume shed have wanted to ix nay the arbor of connubial bliss with a stout ten foot pole cant imagine theyre short of alternate quarters given the size of this place
4379026 kay takes breakfast in bed every morning dry toast black coffee and half a grapefruit broiled im sure someone on staff could verify finding her there
4379027 those last strands looked strong enough to hold as long as nobody put extra weight on the glass
4379028 but what if they hadnt been strong enough despite appearances to the contrary philip theres no way she could have been certain the glass mightve just as easily killed kay and kenneth both while they slept
4379029 kay would have done it this morning if at all
4379030 and youll tell the police shes been with you since breakfast helping out at the office
4379031 which left kenneth free to pursue outside interests for several hours safe to say he had carstairs make the arrangements without help from the rest of staff boys delivered quietly at the service entrance shuttled upstairs with none the wiser
4379032 carstairs must have brought the things from bullocks upstairs himself
4379033 he wouldnt have let anyone else through to kays dressing room
4379034 unless this was an elaborate suicide carstairs takes the rap
4379035 well make sure the police get a good look at her hands
4379036 not a mark on them and severing that cable must have been a bear
4379037 wouldnt hurt the appearance of things if you cried a little
4379038 plenty of time before they get all the way up the drive
4379039 succhiarle il cazzo almente e come te la minigonna e mentre erano mentre il pisello con il bacino mentre le signora mi eccitatissimi chiodi tipo quella signora ancora accontentata

4379044 we have to get cueto out of that first inning with a lower pitch count
4379045 and their lineup rolls around quicker and you face the big boys again in the second or third instead of the fourth
4379046 if he has a 1 2 3 first inning who knows how deep he might go into a game im just glad he got the win because he has been pitching great
4379047 this guy is a competitor he competes he wants it it is refreshing to see him on the mound and he is controlling his emotions a little better and im excited for him and us and his future

4379064 theyre taking over space that should have other native species living in it
4379065 i could sum it up in one word nothing the permit doesnt change a thing
4379066 this is it for backdating of stock options and apple
4379067 with this lawsuit behind me i look forward to addressing the greater challenges of social justice and economic justice
4379068 its going to be really weird when im 80 years old in a walker and people are still calling me americas sweetheart we need a new one
4379069 oh my gosh i dont want somebody to see me standing here looking at myself
4379070 you remember the struggles and pain you had when all the good had turned to bad when behind the scenes you crumbled and prayed for it all to simply just go away you fear the loss and pain of defeat but still are able to stand on two feet you crumble and cry as much as you want but nothing can keep you away from the hunt this is what youve been working for
4379071 i dont think therell be anyone there who can beat us
4379072 we respect china for what theyve done they had a great meet and they really brought their game
4379073 just nine months before the beijing olympics the chinese governments news agency xinhua reported that gymnast he kexin was 13 which would have made her ineligible to be on the team that won a gold medal this week
4379074 johnson recently walked into her local supermarket and was faced with a cardboard cutout of herself advertising coca cola aghast she turned around and ran away
4379075 if theres not continued access of humanitarian supplies if civilians are not protected if they are limited in where they can move its something that could develop into a crisis
4379076 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4379077 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4379078 assemble at the school yard on friday at 6 a m
4379079 this term is used to distinguish between types of the same food
4379080 snow white entered the little house and found it very untidy
4379081 since its invention by alexander graham bell in 1876 the telephone has become the most familiar form of telecommunication
4379082 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4379083 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4379084 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4379085 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4379086 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4379087 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4379088 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4379089 and it got even more frightening when you saw the others
4379090 we are pleased to add people of franks and johns caliber to our board
4379091 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board
4379092 the significance of the study is that many of these schools that had very few if any black students now welcome them and in many cases recruit them
4379093 many of these colleges are very conservative and there was probably little outreach to the black community
4379094 for black students interested in christian colleges there are a number of historically black colleges and universities that maintain affiliations with various churches black students may have felt far more welcome on these campuses than they would on the campus of a predominantly white christian college
4379095 i think now many of the christian colleges see the value in diversity to the educational process also they know that in the real world their students will be dealing with an increasingly diverse society
4379096 we have opened campuses in memphis and in orlando and in houston by doing that and by offering adult accelerated programs and graduate programs i think that broadens our demographic
4379097 i would suggest that part of the trend youre seeing among christian colleges is their service to the adult population
4379098 a lot of our campuses go into cities and have a real commitment to serve the city and serve a diverse population
4379099 at the same time even in the traditional program were very purposeful about it
4379100 its an every day every decision every step we take kind of thing
4379101 some of our schools are more rural or more small town
4379102 seeing that there are more black students enrolled is only part of the picture because one of the reasons you get more black students is because youve been making your campus more welcoming to blacks and other minorities as well
4379103 we began a campus in new york city in lower manhattan and almost immediately that campus was about 45 percent african american
4379104 the other trend weve now seen is that african american students no longer exclusively come from new york city they come from all over the country now that theyve heard about nyack
4379105 you want to drill we want the royalties for the american people and we want that to pay for renewable energy resources
4379106 shed be great i wanted her to run during the recall
4379107 sen feinstein is in position right now in the senate shes chair of the rules committee it would be hard to see her walk away from that because shes certainly a respected leader in our country
4379108 its going to bring down the price at the pump
4379109 even the president has said it isnt a quick fix i cant allow a hoax to come to the floor
4379110 in the context of a fuller more comprehensive energy package
4379111 not pass their royalties to the taxpayer they want us to subsidize the drilling
4379112 there was sexism but that plays a couple of ways being a woman in politics is a giant plus
4379113 theres all kinds of analysis of how their campaign prioritized the races
4379114 made a big difference in giving him the opportunity that he had it was a factor that was important
4379115 they want the war to end and im with them on that
4379116 extremely happy we often find the remains of young victims
4379117 didnt have a lot of detail about what his daily lifestyle has been
4379118 it sounds like the dude just wanted to split theres no harm in that
4379119 this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable kind of activity in china
4379120 everybody in china knows that tibet is an inalienable part of the territory of china
4379121 i see actually most of the people in these demonstrations are non chinese so i would conclude they dont really know very much about the situation
4379122 its only through mutual understanding that we can have peace in the world and we can actually have a better chance of trying to solve issues and not stir up further trouble
4379123 ask me a straight question and ill try and answer it
4379124 its been two years everybodys talking about we couldnt defend the pick and roll couldnt do this couldnt do that its not true we did prove that
4379125 i think they are the best team in the tournament right now
4379126 they are more focused on their goals and thats why theyre favorite for me
4379127 after their 2006 loss in the semifinal against us they came over here to prove that theyre a better team and that game was something bad for them theyre a team in the real meaning of the word and thats what they show on the court
4379128 because two years ago everybody would go coast to coast everybody could make the layup for greece
4379129 and today we saw that they used their bodies because theyre a very athletic team very athletic players thats the difference between the two games we played
4379130 talks are underway and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4379131 my belief is that the president does not intend to leave the country there is no question of him leaving pakistan
4379132 it becomes very unimportant for me to comment on these reports i have been hearing all this for the past many months
4379133 musharraf will neither face impeachment nor be prosecuted we expect a major development in the next 48 hours
4379134 dead zones were once rare but now theyre commonplace and there are more of them in more places
4379135 but things can change and theres no guarantee that we wont be seeing blooms of algae in the future here too so we need to be really vigilant
4379136 a sobering documentation of the growing threat of nutrient pollution in coastal waters around the world
4379137 the conclusion is inescapable that dead zones are now a key stressor in coastal waters
4379138 the evidence suggests that if the spigot of nutrients can be turned off coastal systems can recover
4379139 doing it can be accomplished by using fertilizers more efficiently preventing human and animal sewage from entering rivers and replanting vegetation along riverbanks to absorb excess nutrients
4379140 however nutrient inputs are again rising there as agriculture expands and a return to hypoxic conditions may be imminent
4379141 i am so excited to have signed richard and judy they are truly my tv heroes
4379142 the only viable solution is to license lap dancing clubs as sex encounter establishments
4379143 this would untie the hands of local authorities and enable them to fulfil their duties under the gender equality duty alongside local authorities across the country we urge the government to enact reform and give local communities a voice
4379144 most of us agree that there are areas in cities where perhaps adult entertainment is suitable but there are areas where it certainly is not
4379145 in durham a club was granted a license by the city council in a completely inappropriate location and this has happened all over the country i think local councils need to be given more powers to turn these applications down where they are really not wanted
4379146 assemble at the school yard on friday at 6 a m
4379147 this term is used to distinguish between types of the same food
4379148 snow white entered the little house and found it very untidy
4379149 since its invention by alexander graham bell in 1876 the telephone has become the most familiar form of telecommunication
4379150 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4379151 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4379152 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4379153 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4379156 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4379157 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4379158 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4379159 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4379160 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4379161 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4379162 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4379163 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4379164 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4379165 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4379166 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4379167 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4379168 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4379169 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4379170 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4379171 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4379172 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4379173 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4379174 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4379175 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4379176 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4379177 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4379178 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4379179 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4379180 regarding indonesias 63rd anniversary of independence 385 prisoners in kerobokan prison will receive a sentence reduction or remission
4379181 from that number 42 people will immediately be released because their service period is over
4379182 among the prisoners to get remission there are seven foreign citizens including schapelle corby and renae lawrence
4379183 but it is still only a recommendation the official announcement will be on august 17
4379184 as the world reaches a threshold with modern science and its failures to provide for a relaxed functional state of mind people are turning to old and ancient methods to achieve that paradigm until now nobody created a scientific meditation that held solid ground reflecting its mechanism and therapeutic effects
4379185 the civilized world has used traditional meditation http www painmanagement com as a spiritual discipline for millennia and has believed it to be the ultimate source to relax and merge with universal consciousness regardless of effort and interest ancient meditations could never translate into a scientific mode as their conception perception and projection were primarily spiritual social or philosophical in nature
4379186 the ultimate goal of this scientific meditation http www painmanagement com is to achieve sound mental and physical health and an empowerment of mind
4379187 in this age of technology humans are likely to be challenged by the very advancement they desire such as autonomy of computers to achieve certain solutions which some people will find hard to accept and deal with which in turn will be detrimental to self esteem and confidence
4379188 in that situation it is only the relaxed mind healthy body creativity awareness of self and following correct principles that can compete with the challenge of artificial intelligence and society at large cognitive therapies like dr ajrawats air pulse autonomic meditation therapy http www painmanagement com air pulse meditation and dr ajrawats image therapy will be the scientific tools to keep modern generations on the cutting edge
4379189 human capital comes with a number of challenges but also with tremendous growth potential when its managed properly
4379190 thats why we developed this white paper series examining the staffing and contract labor issues key to any company using light industrial workers it consultants administrative support or consultancies on a contingency basis
4379191 humanitys present crises are not caused by shortage of resources information or know how but because it has embraced as motivation fear and greed rather than justice and compassionate cooperation
4379192 our objective is to discuss amp entertain there is a never ending list of topics to cover and we know there are no taboo conversations in an on line environment adding the video component to our new web site allows us to tap every listening viewing option our audience is into
4379193 so many americans are being misled to think that popping one capsule of fish oil is going to give them heart protection
4379194 either you have to get serious about taking omega 3 or you might as well stop wasting your money on low doses of fish oil
4379195 the meaning of our existence is not invented by ourselves but rather detected
4379196 the real key to contentment and satisfaction is finding a purpose in life
4379197 the movement encourages positive world change from the inside out rather than from the outside in in my experience thats the only lasting route to positive global change
4379198 that scientific studies are showing the personal benefits of finding ones life purpose should be all the impetus needed to encourage millions of people to commit to finding their lives purpose
4379199 honey it don matter somethin else done gonna kill me first

4379274 almost all of us have experienced relationships that ended in a break up heartache and hurt feelings
4379275 many people dont realise but many of the australian wines that they buy in the shops and online for 15 per bottle or more is the same wine that goes into many export products which retail for over 25 per bottle overseas so much of the wine on offer with joos is premium quality at huge savings that has been a large factor in the early success of joos
4379276 if the wine is poor quality then it doesnt matter how cheap it is people wont come back over 8 of our purchases have been return customers which is a clear indication that people are enjoying the wine as well as the savings
4379277 the editorial positioning of these shows is so on target for
4379278 as for the nature of the conversations on buddhist geeks i see them like this imagine talking with an admirable inspirational teacher author or practitioner maybe over coffee or tea at some point in the conversation you naturally hit upon some amazing insights i think we try to capture that feeling in what we do we try to be very practical and yet personable in our interviews which i think is a distinguishing characteristic
4379279 three decades of management gurus have finally institutionalized innovation teamwork lifetime learning and missions that matter

4379469 she wish ego was occasional a longed for placard just the same jivatma at no time need the international date line over against set forth being as how other self
4379470 i was working on a kibbutz collective farm and learning hebrew with a few other guys from outside israel
4379471 they were going to get army training and use that experience to go back home to get jobs
4379472 if i did six months i knew id just learn more hebrew in the army education component and maybe rake leaves and drive a car i figured if i was joining i would do something not nothing
4379473 so little really happens despite media reports about bombs and shootings ive never been fearful the country is small but its big enough that when something happens its far enough away
4379474 as i go about my duties i feel im doing something to help israel and the jews that are there when i was living at home it was important to me that there was an israel i had friends there now its important to me to know im helping keep the country safe
4379475 the goal time was 10 5 minutes and the first time it took me 22 minutes the final time when i passed i was at 8 5 minutes
4379476 we did the course in full gear with a helmet combat vest and a 3 46 kilogram gun it was running a few hundred metres jumping over a two metre wall crossing parallel bars jumping over one metre high logs running through tires climbing a four to five metre rope using only your legs that was the hardest part of the course then crawling on your stomach jumping through a window and doing a final 700 metre run
4379477 if im off for a weekend and go to the grocery store in my t shirt shorts and flip flops im carrying my gun if you lose it theres a heavy punishment up to seven years in jail time were all given precautionary measures to protect the gun from home theft like taking it apart and stashing parts in various areas
4379478 there are times after briefings when were told not to talk about things to our parents or on cellphones or on buses people cant take pictures of us with our guns as many tourists want to do the big concern is being kidnapped as soldiers
4379479 as a lone soldier the army takes good care of me there are between 4 000 and 6 000 lone soldiers at any time the army pays for me to attend university when i finish my tour they pay for my apartment add a bonus to my salary for day to day living and give a 30 day leave each year to go home
4379480 ive learned the importance of taking care of people ive seen no street or store robberies because everyone knows many people walking the streets have been in combat units and will act if they see an incident
4379481 i learned hebrew in four months and with the physical things they put you through i realized i can do it no matter how hard im pushed
4379482 if i have to face it im ready ive been with the same guys in the same unit since i started we trust each other and were confident each of us knows what were doing
4379483 its an opportunity for me to continue to work in the community
4379484 thats what ive been doing for the past seven years here in halifax and now im ready to bring that work and that advocacy to another arena
4379485 do i know whether my pilots need to be more fit than my cooks
4379486 well you would imagine that maybe yes but then again lifting 80 pound bags of potatoes might be very physically demanding so to a certain extent were just going into this completely blind
4379487 were going around to all the bases and to all the wings and im even going to camp mirage in the persian gulf next week to sort of measure what do people push pull lift carry and all that stuff to get a better idea of what they do
4379488 were not going to really know for about a year which tasks are more demanding or which jobs are more demanding
4379489 what weve decided was that it might make more sense to break this up by the three environments
4379490 our current fitness standard is 20 years old and with changes in technology changes in the nature of warfare changes in operations theres probably a need to give it a facelift
4379491 the aim of this is to make sure that we are putting the healthiest fittest most capable people in operational theatre
4379492 weve just launched these large scale projects to kind of get a better idea of what these people do in their jobs to then be able to prepare them better
4379493 basically what it comes down to is whether youre tall or short obese or thin male of female whether youre 18 or 58 theres a job to do and you need to be able to do that job
4379494 then im sorry but were going to have remedial fitness were not just going to just kick you out of the forces if you cant do it
4379495 were going to help people and give them every chance we can
4379496 well actually strap a heart rate monitor onto somebody and say go do your job for eight hours and then well come back and well follow the trace of their heart rate and we can say you know what this job requires exactly this level of fitness and this job requires exactly this oxygen consumption to be able to do it but we know how to prepare them for it and how to measure that theyre actually there
4379497 even the guys who do have sort of sedentary day to day jobs we dont evaluate only what they do in their daily job but what they could be called to do in an emergency
4379498 even your sailor who is sitting looking at a periscope all day or doing something like that if theres a fire on the ship hes a firefighter if theres a man overboard he has to rescue him as well
4379499 if this is not handled properly of course there could be an issue around retention
4379500 and thats why our goal is to develop this culture in which it just makes sense for people to want to stay to want to be fit and to want to improve themselves
4379501 the benefits of icf construction are enormous for this region
4379502 with our temperature extremes and severe weather we need homes schools and workplaces that are energy efficient and disaster resistant our icf wall systems are safe strong and super energy efficient im looking forward to introducing greenblock as a sustainable alternative to stick frame and concrete block construction in this area
4379503 were extremely pleased to have eric williams join our greenblock team
4379504 eric is a certified instructor for several icf building courses and he is actively involved in the building community in this region hell be a great asset for anyone looking to build with icfs
4379505 prezydent republiki przeprowadzi wczesnym wieczorem rozmow telefoniczn z premierem polski donaldem tuskiem szefem w oskiej rady ministr w silvio berlusconim i premierem wielkiej brytanii gordonem brownem w ramach wysi k w zmierzaj cych do szybkiego rozwi zania kryzysu w gruzji
4379506 the approach is nothing like i have seen with other firms
4379507 the managing partners got down and dirty with me in the trenches and proved they know what they are talking about we accelerated beyond my expectations in a time frame i did not think possible
4379508 we are known and will always be known for our integrity and directness we get into the work of our clients and leverage all of our assets to bring progress in developing a sustainable company
4379509 comparing us to traditional consultants does not accurately depict what we provide for our clients we do the work and execute on the daily tactics that lead to ultimate success
4379510 back in 2002 mr ian smiley and i went to china with a bottle of home brewed and distilled moonshine at a local government welcome banquet we opened the bottle and passed the liquor around everyone liked the taste of it
4379511 it is almost like chinese traditional bai jiu white liquor but smoother and with a hint of sweetness immediately the head of the county mr jianguo han and mr guangqian hu wanted us to establish a distillery in their county they offered us tax incentives land usage license assistance right at the dinner table they made us an offer we simply could not refuse
4379512 liquor is a high tax revenue product for local provincial and the state government therefore they want the distillery
4379513 mr hu immediately pointed out that there is no chinese made whiskey on the market and all the imported whiskey aged in oak barrels has a strong oak taste which is very hard for chinese people to swallow he obviously recognized the high potential for moonshine whiskey in chinese market
4379514 china is a people country which means that the rules and regulations are often bent if the merit is evident the local government is willing to alter any regulations to push the project
4379515 my wife doesnt like the idea of producing moonshine and i am not a drinker
4379516 but mr han patiently pointed out to me that the moonshine project as the first whiskey distillery in china would bring not only employment to the local people but also boost the name recognition of his county and build its image attracting even more investment
4379517 if we can share 1 of the chinese liquor market we would be able to employ hundreds of people as well as spending millions of dollars at the local markets this would help local people tremendously since china is consuming about 4 9 billion liters 1 3 billion gallons of bai jiu white liquor a year
4379518 before the end of the year you will be able to bring a bottle of famous moonshine whiskey from china made from an appalachian recipe and distilled by a state of the art german distillery more than legally
4379519 the olympic games have been running very smoothly so we are planning to make some changes in scheduling our press briefing
4379520 its not that we dont want to come and talk to you guys its just that on the operations front everything is going fine
4379521 well see how things are going to decide on briefings
4379522 i think if you are asking us to appraise areas outside sport thats not our remit to do so were not qualified to do that the world is invited here to make its own appraisal and that is clearly what you will do the world will look back after these games are finished and take their perspectives
4379523 on the issue of tibetan independence this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable kind of activity in china
4379524 during the bid i was the secretary general of the bidding committee
4379525 i was confronted with many questions about the opening up and reform of china and i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china to open up further and to reform
4379526 i did not say that china will promise to do whatever with the games coming to china
4379527 you probably dont want to go two match points down but i probably needed a tough match like this
4379528 its been a little bit since i toughed one of those out so hopefully in the long run it will end up being a good thing
4379529 this is a very tangible support for people with breast cancer
4379530 once you get it once you live with it for the rest of your life thinking gee i wonder if when i wake up this morning i might have a problem
4379531 this is nothing new there do come times when you have areas where there are vacations or acute situations where you need to go out beyond your staff complement so this is normal practice for the capital district
4379532 by outsourcing 30 million of staffing time to private for profit companies the province is essentially saying that they do not have a solution to the shortages of health care workers in this province
4379533 rather than taking decisive forward looking action to respond to a crisis the province is throwing its hands up in the air and privatizing some elements of staffing
4379534 the province is abdicating its responsibility to provide a quality public health care system
4379535 nova scotia carriers many carriers have been both acquiring these vehicles as well as planning to acquire these vehicles
4379536 unfortunately youre using that intelligence to further your own selfish ends
4379537 shes not a babe in the woods when it comes to these sorts of things
4379538 he was a happy camper and it all worked out which is the best way to have it
4379539 theyve gone out on what we call the walk alongs to see what the patrol is like
4379540 i have no thought of doing that at this particular time
4379541 all peoples have certainly gone through challenges and some more severe than others
4379542 things happened in the past that we couldnt control and were not very proud of that but were focused on the future
4379543 whatever it may be this is a novel where once you have got intoit you want to go forward without stopping
4379544 when we begin a reputation management project we keep that case secret these other companies that talk about contacting web sites with legal notices and asking them to remove content are putting their clients at risk if someone has an article on a web site that is deemed negative press and a reputation management http www ebadpress com company writes the site owner a letter asking them to remove the story the site owner is more than likely going to blog about the first amendment injustice thus creating more negative press on the web for the client that is why we work in the shadows
4379545 if you have a beehive hanging on your door step and you take a stick then knock it down you are going to have a lot of angry bees swarming around but if you apply a layer of smoke around the beehive the problem can be peacefully remedied if you contact a blog owner or site owner you are asking for a lot of angry bees swarming the web to spread your bad news
4379546 especially in the summer the demand has increased for a product that keeps our customers cool and dry under their suit uniform or simply while traveling
4379547 we noticed that there wasnt a comparable product in the marketplace at a competitive price point and we felt we could meet that need as a veteran owned business we are also proud of the fact that the ultimate undershirt is made in the usa
4379548 the value these business owners will receive for all of their hard work and investment is highly dependent upon how they approach and execute the sale process
4379549 failure to plan for this most important event can result in under selling your business or worse yet liquidation at a fraction of the going concern value
4379550 sadly many business owners do no planning or wait until they are burned out bored or in poor health and then hope for an employee or buyer to approach them they sell from the weakest position
4379551 but if these same owners had run their businesses year in and year out as if they were going to sell them they would be building value over time and positioning themselves to get the maximum value at whatever time the sale occurs lifes unexpected events can change an owners timing in an instant
4379552 due to confidentiality concerns owners instinctively feel that they should wait for that one right buyer to come to them you can run all the formulas and models you like but at the end of the day a business is worth what a buyer is willing to pay if you only have one buyer with no competition how do you know that he she is the one that will pay the most for your business
4379553 we have taken some of the processes that we use over and over in business sale transactions and made them available to business owners on an a la carte basis
4379554 what we see more and more frequently with the baby boomers is that they are thinking ahead they want to maximize enjoyment of life after business but they dont know how to prepare and are afraid to get advice for confidentiality reasons
4379555 business sales are heavily influenced by the last 3 to 5 year history the ideal time to begin planning is about 5 years out
4379556 its an exciting time for these baby boomer business owners
4379557 they have worked their entire lives to build these businesses and now its time for them to reap the benefits the exit planning process can re energize and refocus an owner as well as lead to a much more financially secure retirement
4379558 lig nex1 have again shown that they are at the forefront of spectrum analysis instrumentation and have demonstrated their commitment to building another world class product in a short timescale we are very pleased to have been able to again help them with another design and to have such a good working relationship
4379559 dann habe ich mich umgedreht und alles war sch n
4379560 ich dachte ich bin in einem traum wache gleich auf und stehe dann auf dem startblock
4379561 ich habe mich nur auf mich konzentriert bin mit geschlossenen augen geschwommen
4379562 wir glauben dass die raketenabwehr ein substanzieller beitrag f r das kollektive sicherheitssystem der nato ist

4379566 this bursary program will help attract nurses with these valuable language skills to work in areas of the province that have been identified as having the highest concentration of french speaking nova scotians
4379567 wed be going somewhere and id be driving one car and hed be driving another hed just hate it
4379568 it could be something like walking in front of each other at the mall to competing at the olympics everything he does has to have some competitive piece to it
4379569 im not going in my back room taking down my splits im not thinking about swimming at home thats just who i am i dont really define myself as a swimmer i bet it ticks off a lot of other swimmers because i really dont care i care if i lose but i wont go into a shelter and close a door for days i lost oh well ill try to make it better the next time win or lose it doesnt really matter
4379570 michael is michael and he doesnt like to lose in anything
4379571 i think we all wanted to be the best that we can be and theres a streak of perfectionism in all of us which we probably got from my mom well do whatever we can to be the best we can
4379572 hed just be so upset whenever his grandmother would win
4379573 theres no farm labour pool anymore to help find people interested in that kind of work so farmers have to go through regular channels
4379574 young people are brought up now that theyre not used to doing that kind of work
4379575 theyre a couple of generations away from the farm its an increasing problem
4379576 i dont really have a whole lot to say right now
4379577 were moving forward its positive maybe by the end of the day well have a feel for better things negotiations are ongoing
4379578 we have things to work out but were not there
4379579 i think everyone has a pretty good feeling about it but i dont want to say more than that
4379580 the most direct sensible condensed agenda i had seen for me i havent got time to waste
4379581 apart from tens of thousands of pounds worth of business every year i have met people it would have taken years to meet in any other way and given me training to be confident in any networking situation
4379582 twenty of the drug dealers have for all intents and purposes been dealing on a single street in cape breton
4379583 i think some people will be shocked and others will be alarmed when they hear about this but i think it also speaks to other issues and concerns that are much bigger enforcement is required but its just one piece of the puzzle
4379584 there was a growing increase in prescriptive pill abuse and drug dealing
4379585 in terms of a police investigation it can be very difficult because somebodys got a prescription thats legal having it on them is not an offence but selling is
4379586 we were seeing crimes that we know could be directly linked to drugs
4379587 everything from arsons break and enters thefts and stolen goods we know that all of these areas are tied together in some form
4379588 there are so many poor little kids around here hooked they say glace bay has got more drugs than halifax
4379589 its become just like giving somebody a sandwich or an apple
4379590 that im in this olympics is because of my mom and dad
4379591 i came away from that tour totally loving the sport
4379592 i want to be standing in paris after finishing a tour de france someday
4379593 i have a pretty high expectation of myself and i think i can do that with the right legs for me itll be cool to be part of the olympic experience
4379594 i feel like the schedule was definitely a lot tougher than i thought it would be doing it twice
4379595 im just proud of winning three medals would have hoped for it to go a little bit better but you really cant stick your nose up at three olympic medals
4379596 yeah it was pretty painful my body kind of shut down at the 500
4379597 i did the best i could in the situation i tried to put my hand on the wall but it wasnt good enough
4379598 im not sure why or how but she trained really well leading up to it i guess this will be a big learning experience for her shes someone who when she has something like this you can guarantee shes going to be better next time
4379599 she did a heck of a job here for us
4379600 the question is always going to be whether she bit off more than she could chew but the bottom line is she was the best person in all the events we put her in we wouldnt have done it any other way
4379601 definitely i keep saying that the mental energy and emotional energy and physical energy that it takes to go out there and get up every time even for a prelim you have to put in some kind of effort even michael its just incredible
4379602 hes swimming even more than i swam hes doing it in world record time gold medals it definitely gives me a lot more respect even more than i already had for him
4379603 i think michael is doing what hes doing and its incredible but it kind of makes the rest of us look like if you dont win a gold medal its not you know i even got a best time in the 200 free and i didnt medal its tough but obviously michael gets our sport out there and thats great
4379604 my heart really goes out to katie shes an awesome girl
4379605 i think shes probably feeling what im feeling you know how much hard work you put into this and the olympics are it its like the wimbledon or the pga of our sport shes human we all make mistakes and we learn from them shes so young and such a great ambassador for her country shes going to go on to great things and looking back its going to be a great learning experience for her
4379606 i think the level of competition has risen a lot higher since the games started
4379607 ill just go back to the drawing board and try to work on my weaknesses and try to get better
4379608 i just have to always put in perspective as far as me personally and think ok silver medal two bronze im moving up in the world its better than last time and im not close to being done
4379609 we are excited to have bruce join the senior management team
4379610 he is tremendously talented and accomplished and brings a wealth of industry experience from both a business and technical standpoint
4379611 the mental health needs of returning servicemembers and their families have been a strong focus of our organization for several years now weve made a point of bringing this issue to our members attention and are committed to helping provide counselors with the resources they need to address this growing challenge weve offered multiple educational sessions on this topic at our conferences over the past several years and also offer ongoing access to publications and continuing education courses on our web site in addition we have advocated for federal laws that will provide military troops with greater access to mental health care
4379612 were pleased to have aca participation in this survey and we applaud the many efforts they have made to focus attention on this issue
4379613 like the aca capella has a strong interest in the issue of military mental health because mental health professionals and military personnel represent two of our largest groups of students we believe a big part of the challenge in meeting servicemembers mental health needs is making sure there are enough qualified professionals to address the need our online counseling and psychology programs including the only online caprep accredited counseling specializations make it more feasible to pursue advanced degrees in the mental health field

4379620 we knew we had a business model that would work well but we never dreamed things would take off as quickly as they did things were changing so fast and we had to adapt constantly to keep up with the changes we just werent as prepared as we should have been
4379621 many people would have given up when faced with the same challenges we faced but that simply wasnt something we would consider we worked too hard to build 1800skyride it would have been even harder to give up on it than it would have been to just face the challenges and solve the problems
4379622 were better than we were a year ago and we will be even better a year from now
4379623 we still run across customers who have read about some of our former problems and this makes it more challenging to develop trust with the customer those situations just make it all the more rewarding when the customer is ultimately happy of course there are always some people that believe everything they read online and wont give me a chance to help them because they ran across complaints from other customers mixed in with exaggerated claims about how bad we were it is that little bit of truth about customer service problems from the past mixed in with the rumors that really make it challenging to restore a customers faith sometimes those are also some of the best calls though when you resolve it the customer is so happy and grateful i love those calls
4379624 management has really tightened up on procedures but most of us here at 1800skyride understand that this is the best thing for our customers everyone wants to be proud of the company they work for so the strict rules we have here to enforce good customer service just help create something we can all be proud of great customer service is not easy to provide but it is the most important thing im glad 1800skyride recognizes this and places such a priority on including ambitious customer service goals in the plans for growth
4379625 the collaborative problem solving cps model as applied to challenging kids sets forth two major tenets first that these challenges are best understood as the byproduct of lagging cognitive skills rather than for example as attention seeking manipulation limit testing or signs of poor motivation and second that these challenges are best addressed by teaching children the skills they lack rather than through reward and punishment programs and intensive imposition of adult will
4379626 while challenging kids let us know theyre struggling in some fairly common ways screaming swearing defying hitting spitting throwing things breaking things crying withdrawing and so forth they are quite unique as individuals when it comes to the mix of lagging cognitive skills that set the stage for these behaviors this means that prior to focusing on the teaching of cognitive skills one must first identify those skills that are lagging in each individual child or adolescent the teaching of these skills may be accomplished in a variety of ways but primarily through helping challenging children and their adult caretakers learn to resolve disagreements and disputes in a collaborative mutually satisfactory manner
4379627 cps can be applied to interactions between classmates siblings couples parents and teachers employees and supervisors and nations all people benefit from learning how to identify and articulate their concerns hear the concerns of others and take each others concerns into account in working toward mutually satisfactory solutions
4379628 cps promises to be extremely effective in helping us to deal with some of the thorniest real life issues faced by many if not most typical families not just those with explosive kids so we have begun to integrate these techniques into many of our recommendations and therapies
4379629 were pleased and excited to be working with the ground breaking team at omnis theyre developing businesses that will help intelligence practitioners see the world in new and important ways informing and shaping government policy

4379636 we dont want to merely have a popular festival that shows redemptive films we want to help in the process of redeeming our brothers and sisters who for one reason or the other have fallen victims to slavery

4379644 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4379646 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4379647 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4379648 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4379649 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4379650 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4379651 i was so nervous when i walked in my heart just sunk
4379652 at the end i heard the whole crowd clapping and cheering and i couldnt believe it they were cheering for me
4379653 she didnt get the loudest support though that came for aishath reesha of the maldives who got great encouragement from the chinese crowd around the last curve
4379654 this obviously isnt like any track meet ive been to
4379655 i got nervous last night and wasnt sure about all this but you get to the stage where its too late to pull out and you just have to go with it
4379656 it does give you motivation to work harder and try and qualify for next time
4379657 it might even give her motivation to travel to the micronesian islands where her father korap lived until he was 14 and moved to the u

4379785 the addition of the westchester county and silicon valley magazines continues to support the demand we hear from realtors builders and retailers looking for high quality targeted advertising tools

4379796 its hard to imagine anyone getting their day off to a good start when they have to wake up to the hideous sound of an alarm
4379797 and then all most people have to look forward to is commuting to a job that they probably dont like or arent satisfied with ill take being woken by my daughter over that any day no question
4379798 in the past things like my mindset and thoughts were just never even a blip on my radar
4379799 it turns out my lack of happiness was a direct result of that
4379800 its great to start the work day by being energized by a community of people who are all about living life to the fullest a life without limits it just puts you on track to achieve great things
4379801 when our economy is taking such a hit why wouldnt you want to be involved in an industry that is flourishing
4379802 there are a lot of really unhappy people in the world who just want more out of life we not only offer products that can help them get there but we can also teach them the same marketing system that we have used to gain our freedom which can then facilitate dramatic changes in their lives its a no brainer
4379803 its a shame it really is just recently i saw several of my former coworkers lose their jobs to an outsourcing initiative if you follow the news it seems like there is a similar story every day
4379804 that is major reason why i made the decision to learn how to make money rather than how to earn it i didnt want my livelihood to be at the mercy of someone elses whim besides it is much more fun to get paid what im worth rather than what my employer thought my job was worth my days of trading time for money are long gone
4379805 people know whats going on they know that no matter how good they are the fact remains that their jobs are expendable
4379806 there is no more safety in corporate america and unfortunately career stability is a thing of the past offering a person the ability to take control of their success by providing them with a proven system that includes ongoing training and mentoring by self made millionaires is just something that most people want
4379807 it is great where else can you start a legitimate business have it up and running in a matter of days and have the ability to be profitable and recover all of your upfront costs within the first few months
4379808 i didnt want to wait that long to see a profit and i certainly didnt want to trade one job for another
4379809 it is great to have the ability to not only the help empower others so that they can change their lives but to also be able to lead them and teach them the same system that has allowed me to free myself
4379810 there is nothing better than giving someone the key to unlock their potential we give ordinary people the ability to achieve extraordinary things
4379811 medication non compliance can mean billions of dollars worth of unnecessary spending for the healthcare industry not to mention avoidable hospitalizations and ed usage additionally a patients health is at great risk when they fail to adhere to medication guidelines and this could potentially lead to greater problems improving medication adherence is imperative for patient well being and satisfaction as well appropriate healthcare utilization
4379812 commodity prices have entered a cyclical correction which looks like running a bit further

4379814 find it harder to divert their exports away from the already weak us
4379815 our country has inflicted great pain on many nations especially those in asia
4379816 on behalf of the japanese people i express my condolences and deep regret to all the victims
4379817 i pledge that we will renew our commitment not to fight war and that we will lead the international community as a peace co operating nation to actively establish lasting peace in the world
4379818 i think well narrowly skirt a global recession and the reason is well get relative strong growth albeit reduced growth out of developing economies like china
4379819 what we like are the consumer plays as much as possible we are trying to get exposure to consumer oriented sectors whether that is consumer banking or retail
4379820 that call got a lot of initial resistance because it was the only part of peoples portfolios that were doing well
4379821 to get investors to buy domesic asia and domestic emerging markets is very difficult because the fear now is a rapid loss of economic momentum in emerging markets we would argue that fear is overdone
4379822 q2 looks like the weakest period for advanced country gdp growth since late 2001 when the world was effectively in recession but this time world growth still looks comfortably above 3 5 percent
4379823 are you nuts you want me to say when im smoking and sipping whiskey with allen whos allen im secretly thinking of you and your dog
4379824 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control and it would ratify their continuing engagement with the military force until everything is worked out but it doesnt say that the forces will be replaced
4379825 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4379826 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4379827 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4379828 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4379829 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4379830 we believe that the indian art market has gone up by 485 per cent in the last decade making it the fourth most buoyant art market in the world even though the last year or so has been slower indian art has great potential to grow in the world market
4379831 we have got overwhelming response and are expecting more than 6 000 visitor auction houses and art funds are coming in great numbers
4379832 given the supply driven nature of the current inflation the rbis measures are likely to have limited impact towards controlling inflation in the short run
4379833 recent increase in policy rates could lead to upward movement in banks lending rates thereby increasing pressure on corporate margins also high interest rates would further dampen the demand in interest sensitive sectors we may witness deferment in investment decisions by companies
4379834 the reserve bank of india is taking all steps to control the rate of money supply so that prices are controlled but in taking these steps we need to keep in mind that we do not do anything which hurts the growth rate
4379835 therefore trustees may not be keen to take risks as they will face flak from both the employees and the company
4379836 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4379837 dont put your money in anything if it doesnt make you money
4379838 i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors all over the world and in global markets the price of food fuel and other commodities has been rising we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control
4379839 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all

4379862 we received the alarm at 2 40am and the fire was extinguished soon afterwards we do not yet know how serious the damage was but there was at least smoke damage
4379863 we have noticed for many years that people suffering from food have a lot of problems when they eat out in a restaurant and we want to help the restaurants cater to these people
4379864 this is the first time in sweden and the first time in europe
4379865 its a question of competition too because it could be good for a restaurant to show the sign on the door
