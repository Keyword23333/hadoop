1900012 a brutal dictator with ties to terrorism will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the united states
1900013 apparently its okay for george bush to take this nation to war on a lie to be responsible criminally responsible for well over 100 000 deaths but its not okay to prosecute him not only isnt it okay to prosecute him it isnt even okay to talk about prosecuting him this is unbelievable whats going on in this country how can we have a country where they permit a president to do what he did and they do absolutely nothing to him except to try to protect him
1900014 i heard your book on tape and im now convinced that george bush deceived congress

1900018 no you didnt hear what i said i said what person in authority is going after the killer of these million people
1900019 i dont have the authority of an emaciated moth i dont have any authority

1900031 we demand the best for our children even if you dont
1900032 it seems as though they do it because they are trying to be politically correct but they do not even do that right our kids know it and they feel it they know that many teachers both black and white look down on them because of their culture language and economic status the administration does the same thing to its teachers so it would make since that teachers feel like it acceptable to do it to the students and parents i fought it for a while but could no longer be a part of it they are tearing down the self esteem of kids and they dont care because to them our kids do not matter when they go home

1900112 talks on irans nuclear program in geneva indicated a shift of the us policy toward iran in line with the james baker lee hamilton recommendations of 2006
1900113 has found out that iran is a country which cannot be ignored and the presence of us under secretary william burns in the geneva talks on july 19 approves such a finding
1900114 the probable outcome is that washington will refrain from military action to forestall iranian nuclear arms developments while tehran will refrain from disrupting washingtons potemkin village in iraq in this exchange iran gives up nothing of importance for the rage of the iraqi shiites will only wax over time tehran retains the option to stir things up in iraq whenever it chooses to do so its capacity to do so will increase with time as iraq grows less stable

1900130 so much holiness in the church it made me and others start looking at the church today
1900131 every church was full there was modesty confessions masses we saw an extraordinary pilgrimage of holiness
1900132 we did this because of the promises of christ to his church that it was founded on peter and that christ would be with them for all days
1900133 the promises of christ i could not get that out of my mind christ is eternal truth upon that rock peter he built his church and the gates of hell will not prevail the church has gone through so many stormy periods but it cannot be destroyed because christ is with his church
1900134 thats very troubling when youre told that truth is unchanging christ is the unchanging truth
1900135 explained to me that through studying the teachings of the church and listening to catholic radio
1900136 sounded incredibly catholic they began to have questions about their theological position
1900137 one of the stewardship intentions was reconciliation with mount st michael some months later i received word that some of the sisters at the mount were really questioning the validity of the sedevacantist position

1900145 i feel great joy in knowing im a part of the church
1900146 part of the universal catholic church this worldwide unity of my spiritual brothers and sisters the mystical body
1900147 i believe and profess all that the holy catholic church believes teaches and proclaims to be revealed by god
1900148 i am convinced that god has been behind all of this
1900149 when there are problems in the church do we reform from within or from without we reform from within
1900150 i think the church needs a variety of witnesses to religious life ways to live religious life
1900151 these women and women religious in general other sisters too make me want to be a better person
1900152 as a diocese we welcome the sisters of mary mother of the church to our catholic family here in eastern washington
1900153 their discernment which has led them back to the church their courage and their deep faith have truly been inspiring to me personally i ask all of us in the diocese to pray for them as they pray for us most of all we can thank god for the gift of faith which constantly calls us to conversion and a deeper sense of unity and community with one another we have truly been blessed

1900241 setiap hari kiralah dosa dosa kamu setidak tidaknya mengingatinya janganlah kenang kebaikan kamu anggap sahajalah tidak ada kebaikan
1900242 merintihlah dengan dosa janganlah merintih dengan buta menangislah dengan dosa jangan menangis dengan orang menghina sedihlah dengan dosa janganlah sedih dengan orang kata
1900243 kita hamba allah ini kenalah menyesal selalu lebih lebih lagi di waktu bersalah mengeluhlah selalu nasib kita belum tahu merintihlah selalu terutama dengan dosa dosa kita mengakulah lemah di hadapan tuhan sekalipun kita serba ada menangislah selalu kerana kita tidak dapat elak dari dosa moga moga dengan cara ini allah rahmati kita
1900244 jika kita mengingati dosa kita tidak nampak lagi kebaikan kita apatah lagi untuk dibanggakan
1900245 jika kita membuat dosa tidak terasa dengan dosa kita telah membuat dua kali dosa satu kerana dosa yang dibuat keduanya kerana tid erasa berdosa
1900246 rasakanlah diri kita sentiasa berdosa sekalipun kita tidak nampak dosa kita apatah lagi jika nampak agar kita dapat mengekalkan sifat kehambaan yang kita ini memang hamba
1900247 sebenarnya hukuman allah kepada manusia di atas kesalahannya setiap hari berlaku cuma berat atau ringan dan bentuknya tidak sama di antara satu sama lain namun manusia tidak mahu juga dijadikan pengajaran justeru itu layaklah manusia ini dihukum sekali lagi di akhirat kelak
1900248 banyak orang mengambil berat tentang dosa dosa lahir tetapi mengabaikan dosa dosa batin
1900249 banyakkan mengingat dosa dosa kita daripada mengingat amal kebajikan kita cara ini lebih menyelamatkan kita di akhirat kelak
1900250 orang yang halus perasaannya orang lain yang bersalah dia yang rasa bersalah orang lain yang buat dosa dia yang merasa berdosa ada orang mati kelaparan dia yang merasa bersalah betapalah kalau dia sendiri yang bersalah atau buat dosa terseksa jiwanya sepanjang masa
1900251 dosa walaupun kecil jangan diremeh remehkan dosa tetap dosa dosa tetap dianggap derhaka dosa sekalipun kecil kalau allah tidak ampunkan tetap neraka
1900252 adakalanya orang yang menyalahkan orang yang membuat salah dosanya lebih besar daripada orang yang membuat kesalahan atau membuat dosa kalau dosa itu tersembunyi dibongkarnya atau menuduh atau menghukum terlebih atau keterlaluan daripada kesalahan yang dibuatnya
1900253 dua orang atau lebih yang membuat satu dosa yang sama nilainya setiap orang itu rasa berdosa tidak sama mesti ada lebih ada kurangnya mengikut ketaqwaan masing masing atau mengikutlah tingkatan iman masing masing
1900254 kalau orang telah mengabaikan dosa dosa lahir dosa dosa batin lebih lebih lagi terabai
1900255 kalau seseorang itu tidak bimbang dengan dosa lebih lebih lagi setelah terlibat dengan dosa tidak pun hati merintih dengan dosa itu ditakuti mati di dalam suul khatimah
1900256 hidup di dunia ini macam mimpi aja kerana terlalu singkatnya dibandingkan hidup di akhirat yang kekal abadi masanya tiada bertepi gambarkan kalau di syurga alangkah indahnya jika di neraka alangkah parahnya
1900257 orang yang bergantung kepada amal ibadah ibadahnya menghijab di antaranya dengan allah
1900258 anggaplah kita ini orang dagang di dunia ini bahkan merasakan demikian setiap waktu agar kita tidak terpaut dengan dunia dan mendorong kita buat persiapan untuk balik ke akhirat dengan cara ini insya allah kita akan selamat
1900259 kalau seseorang itu dianggap bodoh kerana tidak membuat persiapan di hari tua yang masanya terlalu terbatas logiknya lebih bodoh lagilah orang yang tidak membuat persiapan di waktu selepas mati yang masanya tidak berkesudahan

1900262 i will prepare a draught for you with which you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise and sit down on the shore and drink it your tail will then disappear and shrink up into what mankind calls legs and you will feel great pain as if a sword were passing through you you will still have the same floating gracefulness of movement and no dancer will ever tread so lightly but at every step you take it will feel as if you were treading upon sharp knives and that the blood must flow

1900282 ive had a wonderful time with you youre beautiful talented and even with your thin paychecks youre enormously generous but i cant keep seeing you it has nothing to do with anything you have or havent said or done but when you asked me on the way back from the party if your connections to my ex wife bother me i meant it when i said it was something i hadnt fully healed from yet i just didnt realize it until then given thats the case its unfair to you for me to continue building a relationship with you while still trying to heal from one a long time ago were i able to look past your connection to her im sure we could be together its just something im incapable of right now i wish i werent but for me to ignore that is to lie to you and even if we never see or speak to each other again i dont want you to remember this as a time you spent with a liar

1900289 eriksson est sempre ao lado dos jogadores falando a eles e escutando eles um jogador pode falar lhe qualquer coisa e n o tem nenhum problema gosta daquele
1900290 no manchester united ferguson tem um assistente que faz o trabalho cotidiano e muito mais complicado para fazer o contato cara a cara
1900291 como um general visto que eriksson como um amigo os jogadores tem medo de ferguson
1900292 ferguson muito s rio e direto no vesti rio n o um ogro mas quando voc v a cara dele irritada no vesti rio voc sabe que infeliz
1900293 seu h bito era sempre ter sess es longas da an lise ap s os jogos era muito cr tico mesmo quando ganhamos um t tulo no caso a liga eriksson e ferguson s o similares em um aspecto ambos odeiam perder s o perfeccionistas e querem que seus jogadores se doem ao m ximo
1900294 eriksson deu me certamente mais possibilidades e mais liberdade para me expressar e aquela era a maneira perfeita de ajudar a lazio ganhar o t tulo italiano
1900295 em manchester ferguson quis mudar meu estilo e perdeu rapidamente a confian a em mim eu poderia dizer
1900296 quis jogar um jogo direto sem o controle da bola e para mim aquele era meu maior problema
1900297 eriksson ama meio campos habilidosos atacando sempre como elano e martin petrov eu penso tamb m que o italiano rolando bianchi ser um sucesso lutador como um guerreiro e tem estilo de jogo parecido com os bons jogadores da premiership
1900298 ferguson preferiu sempre apenas come ar o resultado para ele os defensores eram sempre as estrelas mas talvez est mudando eu fiquei surpreso quando ele comprou nani e anderson talvez est a ponto de jogar um futebol mais ofensivo nesta temporada

1900314 rhodess criticism of cacis role and conduct was unbridled caustic and indignant

1900329 the evidence is now in and that optimism was unwarranted recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity
1900330 these conclusions are significant for evaluating the likely impact of barack obamas recent proposal to distribute 1 000 rebate checks to low and middle income workers at an estimated cost of approximately 65 billion his plan to finance those rebates with an extra tax on oil companies would reduce investment in refining and exploration keeping oil prices higher than they would otherwise be

1900369 i hope the rackspace deal gets the ball rolling again
1900370 the best deals can still go through in a bad market but ive seen some pretty solid deals that dont necessarily turn the market around i dont think one deal fixes everything
1900371 goldman could decide to lower the price because it compares better to competitors
1900372 its also very possible they may consider lowering the price to get a better pop especially considering the fact that the ipo market has been so poor that someone needs to stimulate it

1900434 you have been this way before but i fear i do not recognize you nor remember telling you of my state
1900435 your state is well know n to me but not because you have told me of it so
1900436 the village i live in tells stories about you and how you fed me kept me warm and watched over me when i lost my way in the woods so long ago
1900437 yes yes i am and thank you for watching over me so long ago i have come here to find you now to repay you for your deeds

1900448 fantasy laser when the real world isnt good enough become something out of a book
1900449 i think it is a uniform of sorts for the guy who has good taste but doesnt want the label of wearing a label it is extremely comfortable so you can feel as though you are put together but maintain the feeling of wearing khakis and a t shirt this for me is key because so often designer stuff is a burden to actually wear every day unwieldy buttons awkwardly placed pockets for example
1900450 i like that it is in a sense discreet but those who know beat bolliger whose wardrobe is 65 margiela with marc jacobs ysl and ralph lauren making up the rest gushes of his love affair
1900451 it fits my body well its basic but has that fashion edge you feel dressed up but still casual
1900452 wearing margiela shows you are not like the other men like the others who simply like fashion margiela lovers are a kind of a little aristocracy i like this idea even if its quite superficial
1900453 fashion people are in most cases afraid of fashion they like fashion and like to wear it but are afraid to look like a fashion plate
1900454 margiela an investment in intelligent versatile studied pieces i also like that theres a vague historical context to each collection usually 70s disco rock an excellent era for menswear i have to admit too that i fall victim to the superficial branding of his clothes the white lab coats the anti marketing of the brand the perception that the clientele is artistic and renegade and cool it brings a sense of affiliation that is further enhanced by the four white stitches of his label which is after all just as much a badge of identity as the ubiquitous lv monogram canvas

1900471 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

1900480 this whole city stinks of superficiality i miss the quiet nature the long walks in the woods the horses the tortillas the wise words of senora labotta and teleo
1900481 to alter a clouds aerosols in such a dramatic way that it wont rain the cost will be extreme and i dont know how to do it confidently nature is so large and powerful it can always overwhelm you
1900482 people had all kinds of immediate aspirations that they could control the weather
1900483 but there was a lot of overselling if your town had a drought people would show up and try to sell this then get out of town fast if it didnt work that did a lot of damage to cloud seedings reputation worldwide that still happens
1900484 in other countries you dont have people sitting around saying were not sure this works
1900485 you can see on a radar how it grows to larger particles
1900486 but the chain of events between that and precipitation hitting the ground is much more complicated
1900487 you do a project or experiment and you can end up with insurance claims or crop damage
1900488 the most defining concept in the wilderness act is untrammeled by man the idea behind cloud seeding is anathema to that
1900489 its hard to envision something more offensive to the idea of wilderness
1900490 do not permit long term weather modification programs that produce during any part of successive years a repeated or prolonged change in the weather directly affecting wilderness areas
1900491 under that same logic if i wanted to dispose of toxic waste i could do so to my hearts content on forest service lands as long as i dumped the stuff out of an airplane instead of packing it in on horseback
1900492 right now theres no guarantee but we might be spending time and money and reducing precipitation
1900493 it introduces very small particles and they all compete for the same amount of water pollution means huge numbers of particles so its hard to go in and seed clouds that are polluted
1900494 twenty years down the road if the warming trend has increased enormously and half of florida is underwater politicians will say do climate engineering doing something is better than sitting on your hands if at that point we dont have the scientific knowledge and we introduce the technology we could find ourselves in the middle of an ice age we wont be able to figure this out that fast
1900495 if politics take control and we dont have a science basis who knows what could happen
1900496 its something weve all paid into so it should be there if you are in need of it
1900497 the system you have to work with is a nightmare
1900498 they want to make it as complicated as possible so that we give up or die trying
1900499 youre caught in a time warp still in the middle of an appeal tearing your hair out your conditions worsening and youre staring death in the face this is the epitome of helplessness
1900500 ill never be able to work again no matter what they decide
1900501 i want to work and ive been made to feel like a cheat and a beggar
1900502 they just kind of stand there and watch you suffer
1900503 when i finally get my money we can live like normal people
1900504 i dont think he understands why its such a struggle
1900505 people expect that after they have worked all their lives and paid into the system their disability benefits will be there when they apply
1900506 instead they find that they may be expected to go back to a job they held 15 years ago or take a job that they have never done before
1900507 his disability killed him they couldnt refute it that last time
1900508 are you waiting for me to die too so you dont have to pay the rest of it
1900509 as you retain the ability to perform the type of work you have previously done
1900510 he would say they took the money for social security out of his paycheck without a word but when he needed it there is no help
1900511 she never knew day to day if she would be well enough to work they didnt take that into account
1900512 she would sometimes say she wished she were dead so she wouldnt have to deal with all the bull any longer

1900530 tourists believe taliban are present in kalam and are slaughtering people but you have seen there is not a single militant here
1900531 earlier we were unable to accommodate the huge number of tourists thronging the kalam valley but this year only a few tourists came
1900532 there were 15 people working at my hotel but now the number has dropped to just one
1900533 around 15 000 people associated with tourism have lost their jobs
1900534 there were around 15 people working at my hotel but now there are three while more than 700 shops in the bazaar have been closed nowadays we are charging rs500 for a room that was rented out for rs3000 to 4000 in the past
1900535 it has been a long cherished desire of the hoteliers in murree and nathia gali to divert the attention of tourists from tourist hotspots in frontier province and the emergence of taliban seems to be part of that strategy
1900536 we took up the issue with authorities several times but to no avail
1900537 revival of tourism in swat depends on talks between the government and militants and the media can also play an important role

1900602 in three tours over here ive only had two guys die on me but both of em were real heartbreakers one guy was from columbine hed survived the big shoot out by hiding under a desk in the library he joined the corps straight after that didnt even go to his own graduation hed made it through the invasion of 03 and then the push through fallujah hed done it been through the worst of the worst and then the word came down that we had to back clear some buildings in a sector vacated by a marine unit from hawaii that was rotating home he walked into an old schoolhouse where there were some muj holdouts he took a sniper round just under his helmet
1900603 i worked on another guy whod been bugging the first sergeant all that day to let him call home on one of the battalions satellite phones because his son was supposed to be born soon later when we got home i spoke with his wife and we compared notes i figured out that hed been killed the same hour that his son was born that was some dirty math

1900614 take note that the seat cushion is not a floatation device so do not take it with you
1900615 pass the parcel thats sometimes all you can do take it feel it and pass it on not for me not for you but for someone somewhere one day pass it on boys thats the game i want you to learn pass it on
1900616 the best moments in reading are when you come across something a thought a feeling a way of looking at things which you had thought special and particular to you and now here it is set down by someone else a person you have never met someone even who is long dead and it is as if a hand has come out and taken yours
1900617 why do we even read this stuff we dont understand it it hasnt happened to us
1900618 because one day you will and when it does happen youll have the right words for it
1900619 dont let this get to your head but i had this huge crush on you when i first saw you
1900620 when i saw you i told myself if he looks like this he must be a player but then i was surprised that you turned out to be smart and witty instead so youre actually okay
1900621 dont be an ass even if youre sexy because i already gave you the benefit of the doubt
1900622 then why dont you sound like a filipino i know a lot of filipinos but they dont talk like you
1900623 when there are unfortunate calamities like this the republicans will say see see what we told you we have to have someone whos strong to defend america at a time of concern well senator clinton is strong
1900624 and shes experienced and shes tough enough to defend this country and do it in a way thats true to our values the civil liberties we cherish and thats one of the reasons why im supporting her
1900625 defend this country and do it in a way thats true to our values the civil liberties we cherish
1900626 its a ridiculous stretch i think in times of international crisis which this clearly is what america needs to be doing and serious presidential candidates need to be doing is providing an atmosphere of strength and calm we need to be a calming influence and not stoking the fire and certainly not be talking about the politics of this
1900627 the united states should not get involved in pakistani politics
1900628 perhaps along the lines of what the united nations have been doing with respect to the assassination of prime minister hariri in lebanon
1900629 it is important to us to not give the idea that pakistan is unable to handle its own affairs
1900630 i believe that anyone running for president has an obligation to listen to the voices of regular people and answer their questions directly

1900632 those who made the judgment that we ought to divert our attention from afghanistan to invade iraq and allow al qaeda to reconstitute and strengthen are now having to assess the wisdom of that judgment as we may be seeing yet another manifestation of potency
1900633 the united states should not get involved in pakistani politics
1900634 call into issue the judgment whos made the right judgments
1900635 obviously one of the reasons that pakistan is in the distress that its in is because al qaeda is resurgent has become more powerful within that country and thats a consequence of us taking the eye off the ball and making the wrong judgment in going into iraq thats a serious difference between these candidates and im sure that people will take that into consideration

1900691 welcome to my country i am so honoured you are here
1900692 dan sesungguhnya telah kami utus seorang rasul pada setiap ummat agar mereka menyeru beribadahlah kalian semua kepada allah dan jauhilah thaghut
1900693 dan tidaklah kami utus seorang rasul sebelum kamu muhammad kecuali telah kami wahyukan kepadanya bahwa sesungguhnya tiada ilah sesembahan yang benar kecuali aku maka sembahlah aku
1900694 dan tidaklah kuciptakan jin dan manusia kecuali untuk beribadah kepada ku
1900695 sesungguhnya dia telah mengutus seorang rasul kepada setiap kelompok manusia dengan kalimat yang tinggi
1900696 thaghut adalah suatu keadaan yang melebihi batasan batasan seorang hamba seperti diibadahi diikuti atau ditaaati dalam hal yang melanggar syariat
1900697 dan perkara yang paling agung yang allah perintahkan adalah tauhid yang artinya mengesakan allah dalam beribadah sedangkan larangan yang paling besar adalah syirik yang artinya beribadah kepada allah tetapi disertai juga beribadah kepada selain nya
1900698 beribadahlah hanya kepada allah dan jangan kalian menyekutukan allah dengan sesuatu apapun
1900699 barangsiapa yang ingin meninggikan bangunannya maka wajib bagi dia untuk memperkuat pondasinya karena tingginya bangunan itu ditentukan oleh kekuatan pondasinya amal shalih merupakan cermin dari bangunan dan keimananlah tauhid sebagai pondasinya tentu seorang yang bijaksana akan memperhatikan secara khusus pada pondasinya dan berusaha untuk memantapkannya akan tetapi orang yang bodoh akan berusaha untuk meninggikan bangunannya maka tidak berapa lama bangunannya pasti akan runtuh
1900700 untuk memajukan umat ini kita harus memperhatikan permasalahan ekonomi teknologi dan sosial serta politik agar tidak tertinggal dari peradaban barat yang sangat maju dan hanya permasalahan inilah yang menjadi titik tumpu bagi kemajuan bangsa bangsa barat
1900701 allah telah menjanjikan bagi orang orang yang beriman lagi beramal shalih diantara kalian untuk menjadikan mereka pemimpin pemimpin di bumi ini sebagaimana allah telah jadikan pendahulu kalian sebagai pemimpin dan sungguh allah akan menetapkan agama yang diridloi nya untuk mereka dan sungguh allah akan menggantikan rasa takut menjadi rasa aman bagi mereka yang demikian itu akan didapatkan manakala kalian menyembah ku dan tidak berbuat syirik dengan sesuatu apapun dan barangsiapa yang kufur setelah itu maka mereka itulah orang orang yang fasiq
1900702 allah mengajak hamba nya untuk mengenal diri nya di dalam al quran dengan dua cara yaitu pertama melihat segala perbuatan allah dan yang kedua melihat dan merenungi serta menggali tanda tanda kebesaran allah seperti dalam firman nya
1900703 sesungguhnya dalam penciptaan langit dan bumi dan pergantian malam dan siang serta bahtera yang berjalan di lautan yang bermanfaat bagi manusia
1900704 dan ingatlah ketika tuhanmu menurunkan keturunan anak anak adam dari sulbi mereka dan allah mengambil kesaksian terhadap jiwa mereka seraya berfirman bukankah aku ini tuhanmu mereka menjawab betul engkau tuhan kami kami mempersaksikannya kami lakukan yang demikian itu agar kalian pada hari kiamat tidak mengatakan sesungguhnya kami bani adam adalah orang orang yang lengah terhadap ini keesaan mu atau agar kamu tidak mengatakan sesungguhnya orang orang tua kami telah mempersekutukan tuhan sejak dahulu sedangkan kami ini adalah anak anak keturunan yang datang setelah mereka
1900705 katakanlah dialah allah yang maha esa allah adalah tuhan yang bergantung kepada nya sgala sesuatu dia tidak beranak dan tidak diperanakkan dan tidak ada seorangpun yang setara dengan nya
1900706 dan orang orang yang menjadikan selain allah sebagai penolong mereka mengatakan kami tidak menyembah mereka melainkan agar mereka mendekatkan kami di sisi allah dengan sedekat dekatnya
1900707 dan mereka menyembah selain allah dari apa apa yang tidak bisa memberikan mudharat dan manfaat bagi mereka dan mereka berkata mereka sesembahan itu adalah yang memberi syafaat kami di sisi allah
1900708 kalau kamu bertanya kepada mereka siapakah yang menciptakan mereka mereka akan menjawab allah
1900709 dan kalau kamu bertanya kepada mereka siapakah yang menciptakan langit dan bumi dan yang menundukkan matahari dan bulan mereka akan mengatakan allah
1900710 dan kalau kamu bertanya kepada mereka siapakah yang menurunkan air dari langit lalu menghidupkan bumi setelah matinya mereka akan menjawab allah
1900711 hanya kepada mu ya allah kami menyembah dan hanya kepada mu ya allah kami meminta
1900712 dan apabila kamu minta maka mintalah kepada allah dan apabila kamu minta tolong maka minta tolonglah kepada allah
1900713 dan sembahlah allah dan jangan kalian menyekutukan nya dengan sesuatu apapun
1900714 hai sekalian manusia sembahlah rabb kalian yang telah menciptakan kalian dan orang orang sebelum kalian agar kalian menjadi orang orang yang bertaqwa
1900715 allah berfirman kepada ahli neraka yang paling ringan adzabnya kalau seandainya kamu memiliki dunia dan apa yang ada di dalamnya dan sepertinya lagi apakah kamu akan menebus dirimu dia menjawab ya allah berfirman sungguh aku telah menginginkan darimu lebih rendah dari ini dan ketika kamu berada di tulang rusuknya adam tetapi kamu enggan kecuali terus menyekutukan ku
1900716 kesyirikan adalah penghancur tauhid rububiyah dan pelecehan terhadap tauhid uluhiyyah dan berburuk sangka terhadap allah
1900717 aku beriman kepada allah dan apa apa yang datang dari allah dan sesuai dengan apa yang dimaukan oleh allah aku beriman kepada rasulullah dan apa apa yang datang dari rasulullah sesuai dengan apa yang dimaukan oleh rasulullah
1900718 katakanlah tuhanku hanya mengharamkan perbuatan yang keji baik yang nampak ataupun yang tersembunyi dan perbuatan dosa melanggar hak manusia tampa alasan yang benar mengharamkan mempersekutukan allah dengan sesuatu yang allah tidak menurunkan hujjah keterangan untuk itu dan mengharamkan kalian berbicara tentang allah tampa dasar ilmu
1900719 dan janganlah kamu mengatakan apa yang kamu tidak memiliki ilmu padanya sesungguhnya pendengaran penglihatan dan hati semuanya akan diminta pertanggungan jawaban
1900720 ini adalah jalan jalan dan tidak ada satupun dari jalan tersebut melainkan syaitan menyeru di atasnya
1900721 dan ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka tempuhlah ia dan jangan kalian menempuh jalan yang banyak tersebut yang pada akhirnya akan memecah diri diri kalian dari jalan nya
1900722 adalah jalan yang sangat jelas yang akan menyampaikan kita kepada allah dan kepada surga nya jalan yang lurus itu adalah mengenal yang hak dan mengamalkannya
1900723 orang orang bertanya kepada rasulullah tentang kebaikan dan aku bertanya kepada beliau tentang kejelekan yang khawatir akan menimpaku
1900724 ya rasulullah tatkala kami berada dalam kehidupan jahiliyah allah mendatangkan kebaikan ini islam
1900725 kaum yang mengambil petunjuk selain petunjukku kamu kenal dan kamu ingkari
1900726 ya yaitu para dai yang berada di pintu neraka dan barangsiapa yang memenuhi seruannya maka akan mencampakkannya ke jurang neraka tersebut
1900727 hai muadz tahukah kamu hak allah atas hamba nya dan hak hamba atas allah
1900728 hak allah atas hamba nya adalah mereka menyembah nya dan tidak menyekutukan nya dengan sesuatupun
1900729 islam dibangun di atas lima dasar bersaksi bahwa tidak ada sesembahan yang benar kecuali allah dan bahwa muhammad adalah rasulullah mendirikan shalat menunaikan zakat berhaji dan puasa pada bulan ramadhan
1900730 hai sekalian manusia sembahlah rabb kalian yang telah menciptakan kalian dan orang orang sebelum kalian agar kalian menjadi orang orang yang bertakwa yang telah menjadikan bumi terhampar dan langit sebagai bangunan dan menurunkan air dari langit lalu allah mengeluarkan dengannya buah buahan sebagai rizki bagi kalian maka janganlah kalian menjadikan tandingan tandingan bagi allah
1900731 dan sungguh kami telah mengutus pada setiap umat seorang rasul yang menyeru agar kalian menyembah allah dan menjauhi thagut
1900732 dan rabbmu telah memerintahkan agar kalian jangan menyembah kecuali kepada nya dan berbuat baiklah kepada kedua orang tua
1900733 dan sembahlah oleh kalian allah dan janganlah kalian menyekutukan nya dengan sesuatu apapun
1900734 sesungguhnya barangsiapa yang menyekutukan allah maka allah akan mengharamkan baginya surga dan tempat kembalinya adalah neraka dan tidak ada bagi orang orang dzalim seorang penolongpun
1900735 barang siapa yang mati dan dia mengetahui bahwasanya tidak ada ilah yang benar kecuali allah dia akan masuk ke dalam surga
1900736 barangsiapa yang kamu jumpai di belakang tembok ini bersaksi terhadap lailaha illallah dan dalam keadaan yakin hatinya maka berilah dia kabar gembira dengan surga
1900737 dan tidaklah mereka diperintahkan melainkan agar mereka menyembah allah dan mengikhlaskan bagi nya agama
1900738 dan sungguh kami telah mengutus pada setiap umat itu seorang rasul yang menyeru agar kalian menyembah allah dan menjauhi thagut
1900739 melihat jeleknya situasi yang menimpa saudara kita se islam maka kita mengatakan situasi yang jelek ini tidak lebih jelek dibanding dengan kejahatan situasi jahiliah dulu ketika allah mengutus rasulullah
1900740 sungguh telah nampak bagi kalian pada diri rasulullah suri teladan yang baik bagi siapa yang mengharapkan allah dan hari akhir dan bagi orang yang mengingat allah
1900741 maka rasul kita muhammad shallallahu alaihi wassallam adalah suri teladan yang baik dalam mengobati segala problem yang menimpa kaum muslimin di masa kita sekarang ini bahkan dalam setiap waktu dan keadaan yang demikian itu menuntut kita agar seharusnya memulai sebagaimana rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wassallam memulai yaitu pertama kali memperbaiki akidah kaum muslimin yang sudah rusak yang kedua ibadah mereka dan yang ketiga akhlak saya bukan berarti ingin memisahkan antara yang pertama dari yang paling penting menuju yang penting kemudian yang di bawahnya lagi akan tetapi yang saya maksudkan adalah agar setiap orang islam terlebih khusus dainya untuk memberikan perhatian yang besar terhadap akidah red

1900820 to achieve the visible unity one of the essential prerequisites is that they should be in basic agreement on baptism eucharist and ministry

1901214 una svolta che spazza via le manipolazioni ha commentato domenico delle foglie portavoce dell associazione scienza e vita che corrisponde ad un risultato ottenuto dopo un lungo e sofferto cammino che ha immolato sullaltare della ricerca tanti esseri umani in fase embrionale
1901215 ringiovanire cellule umane adulte per ottenere staminali embrionali indotte certamente possibile perche tutto possibile in medicina ma che sarebbe comunque un doppio lavoro perch la via pi diretta per ricavare cellule sarebbe quella di prenderle dagli embrioni abbandonati
1901216 ha dichiarato il dottor yamanaka all del 21 novembre scorso chi come il professor angelo luigi vescovi docente di bio logia all
1901217 esistono alternative per produrre cellule embrionali staminali sen za produrre embrioni
1901218 viene messo a disposizione dei ricercatori un processo attraverso il qua le una cellula adulta specializzata viene riportata a uno stadio indif ferenziato si pu quasi dire che eravamo da vanti a un muro dietro il quale supponevamo ci fosse un mondo meraviglioso e adesso ab biamo fatto un piccolo foro attraverso il qua le abbiamo capito che quel mondo esiste o ra si tratta di allargare quel foro
1901219 la chiesa non esita ad approvare e incoraggiare la ricerca sulle cellule staminali adulte
1901220 i comportamenti dei ricercatori la mancanza di sistemi di verifica e leccessiva competizione hanno causato studi falsificati
1901221 prego affinch lintrinseca sensibilit morale del popolo coreano come evidenziato dal suo rifiuto della clonazione umana e delle relative procedure si accorder con la comunit internazionale in merito alle profonde implicazioni etiche e sociali della ricerca scientifica e dei suoi usi
1901222 ha raggiunto notevoli successi nella ricerca e nello sviluppo scientifico preminenti tra questi i progressi nella biotecnologia con il potenziale di trattare e curare malattie come pure di migliorare la qualit della vita nella sua terra e allestero
1901223 cellule staminali quale futuro terapeutico aspetti scientifici e problematiche bioetiche
1901224 il metodo pi accreditato per riconoscere la validit di una pubblicazione scientifica quando cio il testo del lavoro da pubblicare giudicato da ricercatori indipendenti della stessa area di ricerca avevano diffuso un elenco molto consistente di malattie tra le quali vari tipi di tumore malattie autoimmuni e cardiovascolari disordini metabolici che potevano essere trattate con i risultati delle ricerche sulle cellule staminali adulte
1901225 lintera lista infatti sostenevano prentice e tarne non basata su alcuna prova di benefici dovuti a cellule staminali embrionali in nessun paziente umano e ha scarse evidenze nei modelli animali nessuno dovrebbe promuovere la menzogna secondo la quale le cure con le cellule staminali embrionali sono imminenti illudendo crudelmente i pazienti e lopinione pubblica
1901226 in nessuna circostanza un essere umano pu essere manipolato o trattato come un semplice strumento di sperimentazione
1901227 questo fatto mostruoso finora in tutti i codici internazionali era lunica tra le fecondazioni artificiali esclusa per loffesa alla dignit umana per il rischio di produrre dei mostri e quindi per un fattore morale altamente significativo riteniamo che anche questo nuovo governo inglese abbia ceduto ad una richiesta di un gruppo di scienziati pare contro la maggioranza del parere dei cittadini e in ogni caso certamente contro la morale non soltanto la morale cattolica o dei gruppi religiosi dei gruppi pro life ma contro la morale razionale che finora risultava ben chiara in tutte le carte internazionali lesperimento quando inumano quando illecito per una ripugnanza razionale non possa essere fatto neanche per la speranza fantastica di ricavarne successi i successi se ci sono devono venire con mezzi umani il bene deve essere fatto con mezzi buoni altrimenti applichiamo il machiavellismo pi spietato alla scienza e alla sperimentazione scientifica
1901228 il settore delle biotecnologie statunitensi produce tre volte il valore del reddito delle industrie europee gli assunti nel settore sono molti di pi 162 000 contro circa 60 000 il comparto meglio finanziato e soprattutto ha molti pi prodotti in attesa di completamento e divulgazione
1901229 non contenti di vietare i finanziamenti molti governi europei hanno criminalizzato la ricerca sulle cellule staminali e la clonazione umana anche se condotta con denaro privato e a scopo terapeutico
1901230 lattivit di ricerca volta alla clonazione umana a fini riproduttivi lattivit di ricerca volta a modificare il patrimonio genetico degli esseri umani che potrebbe rendere ereditabili tali modifiche lattivit di ricerca volta a creare embrioni umani esclusivamente a fini di ricerca o per lapprovvigionamento di cellule staminali anche mediante il trasferimento di nuclei di cellule somatiche
1901231 la ricerca sullutilizzazione delle cellule staminali umane sia allo stato adulto che embrionale pu essere finanziata in funzione sia dei contenuti della proposta scientifica che del contesto giuridico esistente negli stati membri interessati
1901232 non impedisce alla comunit di finanziare stadi successivi che coinvolgano cellule staminali embrionali umane
1901233 ogni ricerca che coinvolge gli embrioni umani si colloca in una inammissibile visione antropologica che considera lesistenza umana non come fine bens come mezzo per raggiungere altri scopi pur nobili come la cura delle malattie e la stessa conoscenza scientifica la scienza deve servire luomo e non servirsi di lui soprattutto quando egli nella condizione della sua massima fragilit un embrione nei primi giorni della sua vita
1901234 e stato realizzato uno sterminio di embrioni sostiene eugenia roccella che oggi rischia di essere una forma di accanimento ideologico privo di serie giustificazioni scientifiche e tantomeno umanitarie visto che le terapie promesse si sono rilevate illusorie
1901235 nel frattempo i laboratori potrebbero usare le linee cellulari esistenti senza interrompere gli studi gi intrapresi e finanziati
1901236 forse il mondo cattolico proprio dalla recente settimana sociale di pisa e pistoia ha ricevuto una spinta decisiva a farsi carico con grande dignit e rinnovato protagonismo anche della questione antropologica come declinazione della nuova questione sociale
1901237 per valutare alla luce delle recenti scoperte scientifiche operate da scienziati giapponesi se sia ancora necessario dare seguito a ricerche che distruggono embrioni erogando fondi a progetti per la ricerca sulle cellule staminali embrionali
1901238 ora che si sa che la ricerca pi avanzata lavora sui tessuti adulti cerchiamo di convogliare i fondi delleuropa su questi studi insistere sulle staminali embrionali quando perfino wilmut le abbandona sarebbe puramente ideologico
1901239 mesi fa ho rivolto uninterrogazione alla commissione europea per chiedere lumi sugli investimenti privati nel settore delle staminali embrionali

1901273 while one is consciously afraid of not being loved the real though usually unconscious fear is that of loving to love means to commit oneself without guarantee to give oneself completely in the hope that our love will produce love in the loved person love is an act of faith and whoever is of little faith is also of little love
1901274 human values have become determined by economic values what is good for machines must be good for man so goes the logic modern man thinks he loses something time when he does not do things quickly yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains except kill it
1901275 the human problem of modern capitalism can be formulated in this way modern capitalism needs men who cooperated smoothly and in large numbers who want to consume more and more and whose tastes are standardized and can be easily influenced and anticipated it needs men who feel free and independent not subject to any authority or principle or conscience yet willing to be commanded to do what is expected of them to fit into the social machine without friction who can be guided without force led without leaders prompted without aim except the one to make good to be on the move to function to go ahead
1901276 man of truly religious cultures may be compared with children at the age of eight who need father as a helper but who begin to adopt his teachings and principles in their lives contemporary man is rather like a child of three who cries for father when he needs him and otherwise is quite self sufficient when he can play

1901394 after ive discovered the image i want and ive sketched it out to capture or eliminate the unnecessary elements and ive factored in temperature wind the amount of sunlight i have to work with especially in the winter i may have 15 20 minutes to render a scene
1901395 then i have to carry everything in and out on my back so i cant bring anything that isnt absolutely necessary i do these small studies about 9 12 inches on mahogany door slip inch veneer which i carry in this
1901396 and i cant carry a lot of extra weight so i use only the necessary colours and avoid bringing in things like extra solvents my work is exclusively with brushes
1901397 afterward i take these small studies back to my studio and transpose them into these large paintings the small paintings are like my data and the large paintings are the full report
1901398 when im hiking or skiing i ask myself what is beyond that mountain ridge is there a lake behind that break in the rock when you climb onto the peak of a mountain and look around theres still more to be seen that extends beyond moves outward reaches further i want people to get a sense of progression and travel when they look at my paintings
1901399 impressionism is a hard sell because the novice buyer wants all the work to show up in painstaking detail so theyre drawn to art in which every hair every dewdrop every fiber is carefully rendered but i find those paintings exhaust me theyre heavy and laborious when i look at a painting i want to feel refreshed and calm a novice collector only hears that a painting took 15 minutes to capture they cant see all the preparation effort and training that went into it beforehand they cant see the years of experience and background needed when making a decision about where and how to apply paint
1901400 when i see an object i wonder what we can learn from it about the people who used it what life was like for them how it can be used to teach others and how to convey those facts its linear and a result of institutional approach and training artists bring a completely different and sometimes marginalized perspective its new its original
1901401 i chose the theme of string theory not only with regards to the evolution in human capabilities which occurred some 40 000 years ago when someone first had the brilliant idea to twine or twist two strands of fibre together but also as it concerns physics and quantum mechanics
1901402 i was fascinated by the idea of eight possible dimensions beyond our current spatial temporal measurements all rolled up in the atom the scientific investigation addresses questions such as how is it we have matter how is our universe constructed
1901403 i love the idea because it is not only linear from one point to another but wholistic all wound into a sphere there are all the usual binary associations male female inner outer and so on
1901404 i love the idea of blowing the doors off the traditional exhibition
1901405 ive often strolled past the stacks at our storage facilities and wondered over the strangely shaped parcels in their archival wrappings wondered at what they were how they were used the people who used them imparting or extending a sense of life through their function the materials for these historical pieces were so different than those used today as well with our plastics fibreglass amalgams emulsions and lcds simpler and with less removal from the substances they were crafted out of wood porcelain zinc cotton wool silk so there is a very tactile sense to them
1901406 but its more than that i enjoy how artists reinterpret media even media that seems archaic and obsolete and make it wholly new for audiences
1901407 they seemed so innocuous and innocent but once you really started to look at them they were really very violent they require more than a superficial look they needed the artists eye to move into those deeper layers
1901408 this is what we are trying to do with these unseen objects in our permanent collection look past the obvious access that which is subtle and veiled
1901409 we have 12 days lets get in the car and see where we end up
1901410 two to three year olds are completely engaged in the make believe but they need their physical space
1901411 before i was aware of this i once made the mistake of walking eli the elf up to a toddler who was sitting in a stroller and hopping him onto the footrail well the kid went ballistic trying to scramble out of the way now im very tentative about approaching young children no closer than three to four feet i stop at that point and chat with the parents and check to see if the kid has opened up if not i wont go there hey if the kid isnt enjoying it its no fun
1901412 its tricky these days because our entertainment is unbelievably sophisticated television is an incredibly sophisticated entertainment along with all these walt disney movies and their amazing computer generated animations plus kids dont read anymore or a lot of them dont yet they all seem to be able to suspend their disbelief its amazing seven to ten year old boys tend to be the most literal minded however and are only willing to go so far its the only group where ive had problems with physical aggression where theyve kicked my puppets they really are the illusion breakers
1901413 these are very unusual occurrences you cant predict them because where are you ever going to run into a performer who wants you to interact with a puppet its a very special rare thing
1901414 i have a collection of old and antique tools stuff that ive picked up at garage sales here and there including kitchen implements
1901415 they vary from handmade to machined some of them my friends gave to me they know im always looking for old stuff like that
1901416 while i was traveling on the coast i came across the strangest looking thing it made me wonder what anyone wouldve used it for
1901417 turns out this odd looking tool was used to open oyster shells the globe was supposed to protect the hands from getting cut by the sharp shells
1901418 it is their sculptural elements that inspire me their shapes yeah their practicality appeals to me as well but i get drawn in by the way the toolmaker embellishes a tool stamps it with that little extra thing that
1901419 ive looked at tools from different ages from victorian to the stone age many of the tools i collect are obsolete now
1901420 this one is inspired by a victorian bread rasp no one uses this sort of thing anymore i assume it was used back then for grating really old dry bread
1901421 when i was little i went to a van gogh exhibition at the winnipeg art gallery what really struck me about it was the breadth of work he produced i couldnt believe that one guy could paint so many pictures you know how when youre a kid you finish one or two pieces and thats it youre satisfied it was an eye opener for me the first time i realized that someone could so excited by making art that they could just keep producing it
1901422 this is a very stimulating subject for me i have enough ideas to keep me going for another two or three years at least
1901423 the weather was perfect and the outdoor performances and the artisans in the platzl had excellent audiences all day long
1901424 the electric atmosphere was one of the most outstanding aspects of the festival
1901425 the skywalker stilt walking troupe a local kimberley troupe appeared in a multitude of different costumes thoughout the weekend welcoming folks to the concert threading among the audiences in the platzl even stooping through the chateau doorway to join in the reception
1901426 just an afternoon event really followed by a terrific arts and appetizer evening event and silent auction at the pynelogs cultural centre the beautifully renovated heritage building on lake windermere the silent auction was the keystone event of the festival many of the artists created one of a kind pieces reflective of the valley it was the creation and display of these works that made the event truly memorable
1901427 if your community has a history of volunteer activity then anything can happen about 85 volunteers worked at arts on the edge in 2005 what made it succeed was the core group of about 12 people who planned organized and ran the events and the excellent unremitting hard work of our volunteer coordinator rob macintyre
1901428 the large number of retirees enrich our cultural circles because they have the time and experience to manage these events well
1901429 you know how we think bill was a good president and did right by our country even though he cheated on his wife and lied about it to congress remember how we felt like his personal life wasnt really the business of congress in the first place and it seemed unfair to mire his presidency in that when he had been doing so much good well maybe its time to remember that you can dislike someone personally and still believe they can do a good job
1901430 a demonstration of deeply pernicious priorities namely its an explicit statement that the campaign puts its own political success above the health of the party and the pursuit of progressive goals
1901431 i am not interested in dances that focus only on movement
1901432 its fine to see these as a dancer they challenge you on certain levels normal people
1901433 i draw my ideas from life from small moments of reality which have become burned into my memory simple things which hit the heart
1901434 it is quite something to come into a traditional japanese theatre off the busy streets of tokyo there is so much noise and traffic and everything is rush rush rush you move into this space which is not only tranquil and quiet but the movements are so slow theyre almost agonizing
1901435 it takes about a half hour to acclimatize to the pace
1901436 i want to make dances that are not too detached or ideal not like butoh the definitive japanese modern style i want to reach into the core into that deep place where we all connect even though these moments are unique to all of us there is an intrinsic shared quality weve all been through something like them
1901437 the difficulties of working and raising a family in vancouver wore on my wife and me so when the opportunity came up to move here we took it i remembered the area from a tour in the 1990s especially new denver
1901438 i went from being constantly busy constantly working to no personal work whatsoever it was depressing
1901439 i focused on rearing our children on working around the home with renovations and other projects
1901440 i explore my relationship with my grandmother she was a strong woman with a very large very powerful personality and when i was a child i shared my room with her as we both grew older she shrank and grew more frail while i expanded and moved outward i was there as she died
1901441 the way she shrank and withdrew from life how she changed colour the way her body was laid out for a vigil how neighbours draped her in a white shroud how her face was uncovered for a few minutes so we could see it for the last time when my father took me outside to see the smoke picking the bones out of the ashes with two sets of chopsticks laying them under the stone even the cold january sunset
1901442 a writer rose nielson will introduce spoken verse into the soundtrack a monologue of sorts which represents the lead dancers inner voice ive commissioned john tucker to arrange the music
1901443 will be performed by this wonderful slender tiny old japanese woman named tsuneko coco kokubo and i will dance the part of my own character

1901473 its like any aviation you need to respect it its not bowling hopefully you are not up in the air terrified that oh my god my glider comes apart because that probably does not conduce to flying well but the craft themselves are very strong

1901513 before people have had this idea that visual memory has a very simple limit three or four items and thats it
1901514 what my research shows is that there isnt that upper limit but instead theres a single resource thats shared out between items what happens is that the items that stand out get more of this resource and so are remembered with greater precision
1901515 to see whether attention was having an effect we had one item flash very briefly before they all disappeared
1901516 we found that if the flashed item was then the one that was moved subjects were better at remembering it
1901517 it just seemed like something was lacking in the research that had been done so far
1901518 people had only looked at the question in terms of do you remember it or dont you remember it you need to ask how accurately do you remember it

1901526 their sexual interactions are not sites where people with penises make themselves men and people with vaginas are made women
1901527 the word virgin did not originally mean a woman whose vagina was untouched by any penis but a free woman one not betrothed not bound to not possessed by any man it meant a female who is sexually and hence socially her own person in any version of patriarchy there are no virgins in this sense

1901571 i am worthy of your trust and this uniform says so
1901572 were only 10 minutes away from the actual site so its a bit like playing in your back garden and ive been to the festival for the last eight years last year we played the t break stage this one we were on the futures one so there was a little bit of deja vu though its a bigger stage but the tent was just as full for us as it was last year
1901573 weve been there for the last three or four years just going as mates
1901574 i think our best year was two years ago last year we played and so we didnt get to let our hair down as much two years ago there was a big group of us about 40 people
1901575 we think its the best festival going its a little bit secret and its small its not like t or glastonbury where you have to keep your wits about you theres a lot from the fence collective and people into underground scottish stuff and a lot of that sort of music comes to belladrum it takes two minutes to pitch the tent and five minutes to walk to the site
1901576 were doing a half hour set at bella and its a shame cos the difference between half an hour and 35 minutes is amazing with that extra five minutes you could squeeze in two more songs and that can make it a completely different half hour
1901577 thatll be in there we have to play it now because its one people know but when weve just got half an hour we tend to come out with the fast paced songs rather than slow it all down
1901578 were learning all the time though two years id have thought i knew everything
1901579 weve been together for four years anyway with this album we had to put a set of songs together that fitted together and we have to do b sides and write all the time but what were writing now is quite different and i dont know how bands get stuck playing the same thing you need to make a slow progression so people dont know exactly what to expect how can any band stay sounding the same after five albums or whatever its all about the music and bands forget that sometimes its not about how skinny your jeans are and all those bands get in the way of people whore trying to achieve something with their music weve had the same haircuts and worn the same kind of clothes since we were 15 and 16
1901580 i prefer it if people dont know all about me you can have the biggest crisis in your personal life ever and you should still get up there and perform on stage and do a show being in a band means lots of travelling and its about waiting on your expectations ive been doing that since i was 16 myself and my band the only way to get over the boredom of the waiting around is by writing music otherwise you just stand still for months and months waiting for the next thing to happen the not knowing is the most exciting part but its also the terrifying part and it keeps you on edge its not a five year job it isnt safe forever how you cope with the stress the anxiety confusion i think thats the only reason a lot of bands turn to drugs people want to be in bands so they can get out of their face but thats not the reason bands take drugs its because they buckle under the pressure
1901581 ive got my friends and family and the myspace stuff means you dont have to move away to london or something because your audience is at your fingertips id much rather not hang around with other bands i see myself as a down to earth person practising and just being yourself rather than what someone tells you to be
1901582 what alan said about this band is what we think in our minds we think were the best band that ever lived
1901583 and that attitude pushes you forward but what he said i was humbled by it

1901856 theyve passed or caught pretty near everybody ive been hooked with and thats kind of nice

1901878 parents should be outraged that california legislators want to allow communists unfettered access to our children

1901958 i their teacher have not yet figured out how to keep the ones at the front and the back all on the same train
1901959 well actually that is an illusion that education is trying to sell us and the public we serve that doesnt happen never has never will not in the classroom not in the church service not even at the most frenetic concert of fans someone will always be off in their own little world
1901960 the great thing about teaching is that we have the chance once in a while to reach out and bring unconscious kids back in if not into the lesson then at least back into the moment with us
1901961 thats why slow enough is important so the moments dont rush by
1901962 that is why personalization is so vital so the moment connects with the recipient
1901963 learning true learning is about the world communicating itself with the mind the heart the soul
1901964 this is what tprs allows us to do and grading has little to nothing to do with it
1901965 that is why you dont want them to leave the language classroom that would be soooooo many moments lost
1901966 this too is the knowledge the truth to keep in your heart and to communicate with your students every chance you get
1901967 there are some good actually excellent reasons for playing the game and playing it well certainly there are many many social personal and financial benefits but it is not soul defining its not value inducing
1901968 its the moments that take place during the game that make playing it truly valuable and those very rarely at least in my 26 years of playing the result of a great lesson plan
1901969 they are almost always the result of connection and communication
1901970 now that is all well and good in theory how about reality we are all left to our own individual and professional devices you know your students and your system follow your heart lead with your convictions but be careful not to sacrifice anyone in the process especially yourself
1901971 so i do my grades as honestly as possible and then i get back to the moments
1901972 wake up now and teach us right we really have to actually learn the language now we have a planet earth that we have to clean up and we can do it so much easier if you just wake up and learn how to teach us the right way

1902009 show me a church where theres division where theres quarreling and ill show you a church where theres pride

1902011 where theres an absence of edifying words theres also normally the presence of pride and of self righteousness because those who are proud are too preoccupied with themselves and think too highly of themselves to care about building others up or to be sensitive to their true needs

1902040 cern has today announced that the first attempt to circulate a beam in the large hadron collider lhc will be made on 10 september
1902041 the lhc is the worlds most powerful particle accelerator producing beams seven times more energetic than any previous machine and around 30 times more intense when it reaches design performance probably by 2010
1902042 starting up such a machine is not as simple as flipping a switch
1902043 commissioning is a long process that starts with the cooling down of each of the machines eight sectors

1902079 ma quale italia dei valori qui i valori ed in primis la memoria li mettiamo sotto i piedi
1902080 questa decisione non solo va contro ogni logica che vorrebbe vedere assassini e delinquenti pagare la giusta pena per il crimine commesso prosegue abaganle ma si scontra anche con il termine istituzione lente verso il quale noi poliziotti abbiamo giurato fedelt quellente massimo che rappresenta litalia intera e per la difesa del quale il collega fausto dionisi nel 1978 fu barbaramente ucciso
1902081 le cariche istituzionali specialmente quelle di primo piano continua il presidente dovrebbero essere rivestite da persone che siano desempio per litalia per i loro valori e per i loro principi non possiamo accettare di essere rappresentati da chi anche se per un periodo della sua vita ha fatto della criminalit una fonte dispirazione non ci sentiamo rappresentati da queste persone che rappresentano lo stato dopo essere stati per tanto tempo lanti stato
1902082 desideriamo che questa iniziativa diventi una opportunit di grande partecipazione a sostegno della

1902085 too quiet too online for our own good and the countrys own good
1902086 people have been saying that in addition to feeling good for supporting the organization they also had fun
1902087 its exciting for me we all had a lot of fun
1902088 when i feel as if the work i am doing is valuable and contributing to the community in the broadest sense
1902089 then im happy because im bringing something new to the table
1902090 this dramatic deficiency is making our job harder to do
1902091 voters want to get as intimate a feel for the next president of the united states as possible
1902092 its a jump ball between the telegraph and internet both resulted in profound change the telegraph sped up the news and of course now with the internet its instantaneous were seeing a change in how people want their news its a broad sweep of history so its hard to choose just one
1902093 im very frustrated with the fact that many talented journalists of color appear to be leaving the industry
1902094 the newsrooms of the future are not going to survive if we do not accurately reflect whats going on in the country
1902095 you dont have to be hispanic to cover hispanic issues
1902096 the instant access to not just a plethora of sources but raw databases dramatically reshaped not only the business but the world as well
1902097 they will tune in at the beginning of the year
1902098 clinton seems quite unflappable though obama will continue to challenge her
1902099 be skeptical on the talk of campaigns because we were so badly led
1902100 things are not getting into newspapers but they are getting into websites
1902101 people will go for that and it will sell ads too
1902102 because you cant enforce the rule to use a real name and you cant make it legitimate its a moot question
1902103 the opportunity is there for someone to say some dangerous things and get away with it
1902104 there is no implication that your paper is endorsing anything thats on those boards
1902105 most of the time thats possible but thats the reason we have teachers in classrooms
1902106 many of the editors said they felt mostly on their own in making the tough decisions
1902107 theres no getting around the budget cuts but its time to stop the bleeding in our nations newsrooms
1902108 new revenue is starting to replace the revenue lost from traditional sources
1902109 if we lose diversity were going to lose those audiences

1902115 la condition quun accord soit trouv entre les deux clubs
1902116 nous nen sommes aujourdhui pas trop loign s dans 24h celui ci pourrait tre ent rin d finitivement
1902117 habib a souhait partir les n gociations avec lui nont pas forc ment abouti dans le sens quil souhaitait nous lui proposions un nouveau contrat de trois ans et sur le plan financier il estimait peut tre obtenir plus alors que sur l chelle des salaires de lom le sien est d j important
1902118 i guess now is the best time to tell you im engaged
1902119 los psiquiatras fueron presionados para que nos dieran el alta a todos juntos porque se venc a el contrato de la art consolidar con el gobierno
1902120 la condici n que fij el doctor es que no volviera a estar en contacto con los internos
1902121 es imposible para m trabajar ah porque continuamente por m s que no est s en la guardia te cruz s con internos
1902122 nos amenazaron con que si no volvemos a trabajar a los dos a os nos dan la baja
1902123 yo quiero trabajar pero todav a no estoy curado y s que en el spc puedo perder toda la recuperaci n que fui logrando
1902124 todo anduvo bien hasta que una vez me mandaron a buscar unas mercader as a san mart n
1902125 estuve seis meses haciendo de administrativo en el servicio pero despu s me llamaron para ir a la guardia de bouwer
1902126 estuve cuatro o cinco d as y no aguant m s
1902127 yo pens que por mi carrera me conven a pero me mandaron de vuelta con los presos est claro que me arruinaron la carrera
1902128 todas las ilusiones que ten a de crecer laboralmente se me fueron
1902129 no quiero estar m s en contacto ni con los presos ni con los jefes que nos cagaron cuando nos mandaron al choque sin estar preparados
1902130 no vamos a hacer nada que no est expresamente recomendado por las autoridades m dicas
1902131 tocalli entendi nuestra situaci n y nos prometi buscar alguna soluci n para no tener que volver al servicio
1902132 nosotros nunca molestamos para nada los que salieron en la televisi n recibieron indemnizaci n casa y trabajo en otro lado
1902133 por una cuesti n de tica me parec a improcedente lo que se iba a resolver
1902134 por eso creo que es correcto que se los asigne a un puesto fuera del servicio pero dentro del ministerio
1902135 it all stems from the administrations decision to endorse torture
1902136 once the decision was made to use torture the administration needed a system of rules that would allow them to rely on evidence obtained from torture thus these military commissions
1902137 the most absurd thing is that if by some miracle hamdan had been found guilty on all counts acquittal wouldnt have meant liberty hed have just been moved to a different cell the trial was essentially meaningless because the administration takes the position that it has the right to hold enemy combatants until the end of the war on terror whether or not they have been convicted of crimes
1902138 i just dont like answering questions i had to talk all day
1902139 if you come into the strip club and people dont already know you how do you think they are going to get to know you

1902141 this will help us have a strategic start to our five year plan
1902142 for smaller newspapers its a difficult amount of money for them to come up with
1902143 at the same time this organization needs to be supported and funded
1902144 no one asked why would we put this on the web they asked how fast can we put this on the web
1902145 after 10 oclock we switched to updating information on a blog
1902146 before 11 30 a m the reporter joe macenka had updated the blog more than 30 times
1902147 later we took the blog entry and turned that into a story for our print extra
1902148 make it good enough and get back in the field
1902149 there cannot be any delay because if there is readers will go somewhere else
1902150 as visual and multimedia reporters there was no way we could get a good shot or compete with all the satellite trucks
1902151 the viewer is just experiencing it gives them a chance to step back from the mass of information and updates
1902152 lean on your friends it is going to be harder than you think

1902156 israel will be releasing palestinian prisoners towards the end of august as a gesture of goodwill towards the palestinians in response to a request by palestinian president mahmud abbas
1902157 its interesting why cultural executives arent being used as non executive directors on commercial boards
1902158 lets go down to the river and fish for snapper
1902159 and the ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour these have one purpose and they give their power and authority to the beast these will wage war against the lamb and the lamb will overcome them because he is lord of lords and king of kings and those who are with him are the called and chosen and faithful
1902160 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
1902161 who is and who was and who is to come the almighty
1902162 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god he was in the beginning with god all things came into being by him and apart from him nothing came into being that has come into being in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it
1902163 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth all things were created by him and for him
1902164 all authority is given unto me in heaven and in earth
1902165 for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich
1902166 that god would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith
1902167 that christ may settle down and be at home in your hearts by faith
1902168 if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him
1902169 i go to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also
1902170 once there was fine warren on the edge of a wood overlooking the meadows of a farm
1902171 one day the farmer though i could increase these rabbits make them part of my farm their meat their skins
1902172 they grew big and strong and healthy for he saw to it that they had all of the best particularly in winter and nothing to fear except the running knot in the hedge gap and the wood path so they lived as he wanted them to live and all the time there were a few who disappeared the rabbits became strange in many ways different from other rabbits they knew well enough what was happening but even to themselves they pretended all was well for the food was good they were protected they had nothing to fear but the one fear
1902173 not of being active but acted upon affected by outside force s or agenc ies and receiving or enduring without resistance or emotional reaction
1902174 it is the spirit that quickeneth giveth life the flesh profiteth nothing
1902175 he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting
1902176 for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace
1902177 the mind of the flesh the mind of the spirit
1902178 faith is a living busy active mighty thing so it is impossible for it not to do good works incessantly
1902179 it hurts my brain to think about it but i have to think about it because it hurts my soul not to think about it
1902180 there is no doubt that the accident was like tearing the insides right out of me
1902181 my first wife and i both loved the lord she was a wonderful woman we spent seven years together i felt gods presence right there on that highway in pennsylvania i felt gods peace now im thankful that i knew him years before that i didnt have to come to that point in my life and see my wife and child lying on a highway and have no hope at all hope is the essence of life
1902182 sportsmanship character community involvement and contributions to team and baseball
1902183 leave me alone ive been hurt i dont have to trust you or anyone else anymore
1902184 well thats not what i thought and im a christian
1902185 have you ever experienced the dissonance that comes from the contradiction of your personal experience and your beliefs
1902186 the deep fear behind every loss is that we have been abandoned by the god who should have saved us
1902187 disconfirmation bias the tendency for people to extend critical scrutiny to information which contradicts their prior beliefs and uncritically accept information that is congruent with their prior beliefs
1902188 my son if youre in sin go find a confessor if not then come and join your brothers
1902189 pilate having scourged jesus delivered him to them to be crucified and they crucified him
1902190 lord you said that once i decided to follow you youd walk with me all the way but i have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life there is only one set of footprints i dont understand why when i needed you most you would leave me
1902191 my precious precious child i love you and i would never leave you during your times of trial and suffering when you see only one set of footprints it was then that i carried you
1902192 our god is able to deliver us but even if he doesnt we will not serve or worship your gods
1902193 i have not always been a christian but god showed me my need of jesus christ i committed my life to jesus and now my life is different
1902194 thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
1902195 i dont trust you to get what i mean by this and you may not want to read the book if i dont give you something else so here is all this extra information
1902196 youre good enough youre better than most of these other people they are the ones that need to be saved
1902197 john if you dont get saved you are going to go straight to hell no matter what anyone else thinks you are not saved
1902198 one of gods main jobs is making people he makes these to put in place of the ones that die so there will be enough people to take care of things here on earth he doesnt make grownups just babies i think because they are smaller and easier to make that way he doesnt have to take up his valuable time teaching them to talk and walk he can just leave that up to the mothers and fathers i think it works out pretty good gods second most important job is listening to prayers an awful lot of this goes on as some people like preachers and things pray other times besides bedtime god doesnt have time to listen to the radio or t v on account of this as he hears everything not only prayers there must be a terrible lot of noise going into his ears unless he has thought of a way to turn it off god sees everything and hears everything and is everywhere which keeps him pretty busy so you shouldnt go wasting his time by going over your parents head and ask for something they said you couldnt have atheists are people who dont believe in god i dont think there are any in chula vista at least there arent any who come to our church jesus is gods son he used to do all the hard work like walking on water and doing miracles and trying to teach people about god who didnt want to learn they finally got tired of him preaching to them and they crucified him but he was good and kind like his father and he told his father that they didnt know what they were doing and to forgive them and god said ok his dad god appreciated everything he had done and all his hard work on earth so he told him he didnt have to go out on the road anymore he could stay in heaven so he did and now he helps his dad out by listening to prayers and seeing which things are important for god to take care of and which ones he can take care of himself without having to bother god with like a secretary only more important of course you can pray anytime you want and they are sure to hear you because theyve got it worked out so one of them is on duty all the time you should always go to sunday school because it makes god happy and if anybody you want to make happy its god dont skip sunday school to do something you think will be more fun like going to the beach that is wrong and beside the sun doesnt come out at the beach until noon anyway if you dont believe in god besides being an atheist you will be very lonely because your parents cant go everywhere with you like to camp but god can its good to know hes around when youre scared of the dark or when you cant swim very good and you get thrown in real deep water by big kids but you shouldnt think always of what god can do for you i figure god put me here and he can take me back anytime he pleases and thats why i believe in god
1902199 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
1902200 and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works
1902201 all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
1902202 it was agreed the time is right to make this change
1902203 we are moving towards transformation at super rugby level and allowing foreign players to be involved with our teams not for the first time is part of that evolutionary process
1902204 the re introduction of foreign players will have advantages for our teams for our fans and for overseas marquee or emerging players wanting to experience the best provincial competition in the world
1902205 it will of course be tightly controlled and managed that is why we are still waiting on final details from management before endorsing the change
1902206 we want the most commercially attractive competition our goal is to retain the best talent
1902207 we cant hide from the economic engines of french and english rugby
1902208 the most compelling search for excellence that exists in sports and maybe in life itself
1902209 an olympic medal is the greatest achievement and honor that can be received by an athlete i would swap any world title to have won gold at the olympics
1902210 the most important thing in the olympic games is not winning but taking part
1902211 can you just get off the phone i dont wanna hear you talk anymore talking on your phone while in here is just tacky where are you from thats its ok to do this
1902212 im sad to admit that this was the session i got the least out of
1902213 i love the fact that bob would most certainly take issue with that pointing the glory back to god and saying
1902214 there are very few biotech derived fruits and vegetables on the market and there is not too many being actively developed that are close to being on the market
1902215 i dont see anybody in the washington state apple industry trying to market a genetically modified apple at this point in time for fear of getting clobbered by the activists
1902216 bananas like papayas are susceptible to a large number of devastating diseases for which there is no known treatment and no known resistance within the species
1902217 after the democratic victory in november 2006 the industry had to scramble
1902218 we dont look at it through the prism of democrats and republicans we look at it in terms of those who support free market policies and those who dont
1902219 they are healthier and break down in the body more easily
1902220 im aware that edibles would be healthier and probably taste more natural without the addition of corn syrup or that high fructose junk
1902221 but i dont look for that ingredient when i purchase foods mostly because the labels are too long the ingredients too numerous the print too small and the chemicals too frightening
1902222 we really think that consumer attitudes have come to accept food from biotechnology
1902223 consumer preference is the critical factor kellogg uses in determining the products being provided in every market
1902224 escalate the issue to the highest level possible in the government and within his own company

1902227 war is coming but everyone including russia is turning a blind eye russian statements are not helping us
1902228 a sniper war is ongoing against residents of the villages in the south ossetian conflict zone and as i speak now intensive fire is ongoing from artillery from tanks from self propelled artillery systems which have been brought in the conflict zone illegally and from other types of weaponry including from mortars and grenade launchers
1902229 the russian peacekeeping forces told us several hours ago that they have totally lost control over the separatist forces
1902230 we are in permanent contact with the russian foreign ministry but it fails to convince the separatist to cease fire
1902231 how we were eased into the longest costliest and most shameful foreign war in the history of this country
1902232 probably feels like too many things have happened to it
1902233 its all twisted in something so far from what it used to be
1902234 if he wants things to be cool then he needs to talk to me im tired of being the bigger person when im not wrong

1902243 i never gave up in my life i am surely not going to give up now
1902244 but finally some climbers did not take their responsibility and then accidents like this happen very easy
1902245 i would love it if everyone could contemplate this ocean of mountains and glaciers they put me through the wringer but its so beautiful the night will be long but beautiful
1902246 whether it can be altered or not whether its right or wrong landlordism is one of the causes of poverty
1902247 poverty is not caused by men and women getting married its not caused by machinery its not caused by over production its not caused by drink or laziness and its not caused by over population
1902248 these are their gasometers and what right have the likes of us to expect them to allow us to breathe for nothing
1902249 you think just because youre bigger than me that i wont hit you

1902272 there is a broad view by the public that our health care system needs a full overhaul either to be totally rebuilt or reformed
1902273 often paperwork doesnt arrive or your records arent available when you show up there are also concerns about getting timely access to care
1902274 also having a regular doctor who is available to see you getting timely referrals and having more affordable care are important to people
1902275 we now spend twice per capita what other developed nations spend on care yet we die younger have worse access to care and are even behind on medical computerization
1902276 these survey results are a clarion call for the health financing mechanism used elsewhere nonprofit national health insurance
1902277 we have seen the number of uninsured rise we have seen people facing higher out of pocket costs we see layers of complications in terms of billing problems
1902278 all that adds up to an american public that is quite ready for health care reform
1902279 when one thinks of beer and bratwurst one tends to think of either faraway germany or milwaukee in the heartland that quirk of culinary geography says a lot about why barack obama can give a public speech in berlin without catching the kind of flak that a similar outing under the eiffel tower would garner
1902280 an appearance in germany brings few of the dangers that a campaign speech before cheering throngs in the land of pinot and foie gras might while plenty could go wrong and a backlash is still possible one thing is clear there is little danger of being labeled effete in the home of oktoberfest and oom pah bands

1902285 but when cal took momentum at the start of the second half at least a third and likely close to a half of the oregon fans were in the parking lot drinking they leave at the half and dont return to their seats in time for the start of the third quarter this was downright shocking to me cal took control of the game and they cared more about getting a beer in my mind there is no way they can be considered the best fans in the pac 10 or honestly even be in the discussion until they stop doing this
1902286 i live in colorado texas and kansas state equals boring rest assured your ratings will be weak where cal org isnt on besides home team markets it should be on nationally

1902290 sitting in the foothills of the cascade mountains oregons autzen stadium is one of college footballs hidden jewels
1902291 im back to list the overall top 10 most intimidating stadiums in the nation for the overall top 10 its back to the basics the 10 most intimidating stadiums for one game and one game only 1 autzen stadium oregon 2 ben hill griffin stadium florida 3 kyle field texas a amp m 4 tiger stadium lsu 5 doak campbell stadium florida state 6 ohio stadium ohio state 7 lane stadium virginia tech 8 jordan hare stadium auburn 9 notre dame stadium notre dame 10 memorial stadium nebraska trust me on autzen just go to the place and soak it all in before they throw dirt on you take a trip to eugene one fall saturday autzen stadium is a zoo theres no other way to say it get inside your own 20 in a tight game and you can forget about a hearing b avoiding false starts and c success
1902292 top 10 college football stadiums 10 autzen stadium you can have your cookie cutter midwest stadiums and the beauty and pageantry of southern traditions well take the most hostile atmosphere this side of gainesville any day anyway
1902293 top five most underrated college football atmospheres 5 autzen stadium its not so much the atmosphere as the noise wow just 54 000 plus fans but the noise rattles all over the place night games are similar to lsus tiger stadium
1902294 per square yard the loudest stadium in the history of the planet
1902295 q what would you say the loudest stadiums are corso i think autzen stadium per person the oregon stadium is the loudest stadium ive ever been in the fact that its so low to the ground doesnt allow the sound to escape
1902296 if youve never been to a game at autzen stadium do yourself a favor and get there soon one word for the experience loud hurt your ears loud make them bleed loud the big ten has nothing as loud as autzen
1902297 per capita autzen is the loudest venue in all of college football
1902298 its very tough the crowd there is unbelievably educated on when to be loud and when to calm down when they have the ball its just a very tough environment with the noise and just trying to communicate
1902299 they are very difficult to beat at home the crowd is from every report i get from every coach ive spoken with a real factor you have to learn to communicate without talking because talking doesnt do you any good
1902300 crowd noise is almost an unfair advantage you cant check plays you seemingly have less time on the play clock and everything starts to feel really rushed
1902301 theyre going to be loud from the first snap until the last snap they are right on top of you and theyre just relentless

1902490 i was encouraged by the offensive lin in our inside running drills today it was the best ive seen them play since spring
1902491 one of our rules is to treat the ground like a hot stove
1902492 we have miles to go but we are making a lot of progress in throwing and catching the ball route running and understanding spacing versus zone and separation versus man
1902493 we dont want the cart to get ahead of the horse trying to do too much

1902496 wahai rasulullah saya tidak ada seorang penuntun yang menuntunku ke masjid bolehkah aku tidak sholat dengan berjamaah dan cukup sholat di rumah
1902497 demi allah yang jiwaku dalam genggamannya sungguh aku pernah akan menyuruh mengumpulkan kayu bakar kemudian aku perintahkan untuk shalat lalu adzan pun dikumandangkan
1902498 shalat berjamaah lebih utama daripada shalat sendirian dengan dua puluh tujuh derajat
1902499 apabila dia wudhu sempurna kemudian keluar menuju ke masjid dengan niat hanya untuk shalat maka setiap kali ia melangkah derajatnya dinaikkan dan kesalahan dosanya dihapuskan
1902500 malaikat akan senantiasa memohonkan ampun dan rahmat untuknya selama ia masih tetap berada di tempat shalatnya dan tidak berhadast
1902501 tidaklah tiga orang berada di suatu desa atau kampung lalu mereka tidak melakukan shalat berjamaah kecuali mereka telah dikuasai oleh syetan
1902502 sesungguhnya aku diutus ke bumi ini untuk menyempurnakan kemuliaan akhlak oktober 25 2007

1902507 dan para malaikat masuk kepada tempat tempat mereka dari semua pintu sambil mengucapkan keselamatan atas kalian berkat kesabaran kalian maka alangkah baiknya tempat kesudahan itu
1902508 allah swt menyebutkan sabar di dalam lebih dari 70 tempat
1902509 adakah yang lebih utama daripada sabar allah telah menyebutkannya di dalam kitab nya lebih dari 90 tempat kami tidak mengetahui sesuatu yang disebutkan allah sebanyak ini kecuali sabar
1902510 dan tahanlah dirimu bersama dengan orang orang yang menyeru rabbnya di pagi dan di senja hari dengan mengharap keridhaannya dan janganlah kedua matamu berpaling dari mereka
1902511 sama saja bagi kita mengeluh ataukah bersabar sekali kali kita tidak mempunyai tempat untuk melarikan diri
1902512 bahwa sabar itu ada dua pertama bersifat badani fisik seperti menanggung beban dengan badan berupa pukulan yang berat atau sakit yang kronis
1902513 dan orang orang yang sabar dalam musibah penderitaan dan dalam peperangan mereka itulah orang orang yang benar imannya dan mereka itulah orang orang yang bertakwa
1902514 dan dia memberi balasan kepada mereka atas kesabaran mereka dengan surga dan pakaian sutera

1902516 sesungguhnya kami telah menciptakan manusia dari setetes mani yang tercampur yang kami hendak mengujinya dengan perintah dan larangan
1902517 ali laam miim apakah manusia mengira bahwa mereka dibiarkan saja mengatakan kami telah beriman padahal mereka belum diuji lagi dan sesungguhnya kami telah menguji orang orang yang sebelum mereka maka sesungguhnya allah mengetahui orang orang yang benar dan sesungguhnya dia mengetahui orang orang yang dusta
1902518 sesungguhnya bapakku memanggil kamu agar ia memberi balasan terhadap kebaikan mu memberi minum ternak kami
1902519 jika kamu tidak malu maka lakukanlah apa yang ingin kamu lakukan
1902520 sesungguhnya apabila seorang suami menatap istrinya dan istrinya membalas pandangan dengan penuh cinta kasih maka allah menatap mereka dengan pandangan kasih sayang dan jika sang suami membelai tangan istrinya maka dosa mereka jatuh berguguran di sela sela jari tangan mereka
1902521 bila seorang suami mengajak istrinya ke tempat tidurnya lalu ia menolak sehingga suaminya semalaman marah kepadanya maka malaikat mengutuknya hingga pagi
1902522 ya rabbku sesungguhnya aku menazarkan kepada engkau anak yang dalam kandunganku menjadi hamba yang saleh dan berkhidmat di baitul maqdis karena itu terimalah nazar itu daripadaku sesungguhnya engkaulah yang maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
1902523 ya rabbku sesungguhnya aku melahirkannya seorang anak perempuan dan allah lebih mengetahui apa yang dilahirkannya itu dan anak laki laki tidaklah seperti anak perempuan sesungguhnya aku telah menamai dia maryam dan aku mohon perlindungan untuknya serta anak anak keturunannya kepada pemeliharaan engkau daripada syaitan yang terkutuk
1902524 ya rabbku tunjukilah aku untuk mensyukuri nimat engkau yang telah engkau berikan kepadaku dan kepada ibu bapakku dan supaya aku dapat berbuat amal yang saleh yang engkau ridhai berilah kebaikan kepadaku dengan memberi kebaikan kepada anak cucuku sesungguhnya aku bertaubat kepada engkau dan sesungguhnya aku termasuk orang orang yang berserah diri

1902528 ya rabbku sesungguhnya aku telah berbuat zalim terhadap diriku dan aku berserah diri bersama sulaiman kepada allah rabb semesta alam
1902529 sesungguhnya aku tidak menyia nyiakan amal orang orang yang beramal di antara kamu baik laki laki atau perempuan karena sebagian kamu adalah turunan dari sebagian yang lain 259 qs 3 195

1902592 we believe she took advantage of harvey at a time he was very vulnerable weak and struggling
1902593 with anne melican it was always one way what do i get what does my son get it was everything to her benefit
1902594 harvey was a brilliant businessman who controlled his business and every other part of his life he was such an awesome man
1902595 i dont think a little gal like me would have that kind of influence over him
1902596 i dont know why theyre trying to annihilate me i was very good to harvey and he to me i feel rather victimized
1902597 for any member of the strother family to claim after harveys death that anne controlled harvey during life is simply not worthy of belief as no one including his immediate family could control harvey
1902598 but all his life he battled demons in the end the demons won
1902599 i was completely captivated by harvey and i think he by me
1902600 he never he never stopped having a glass of wine

1902730 yeah if it came down to that id be willing to go to prison because i know i did the right thing and i can sleep at night and my conscience is still good
1902731 i support robin long because he is a soldier of conscience there is a huge propaganda campaign in this country to get young men to join the military he bought the hype he signed up for a promised non combat job but it turned out not to be so he decided to go to canada and follow his conscience instead

1902891 many of these restaurants have the nutrition information online that you can print out and go over with your kids even before you go so that everybody is on the same page before they pull up to the drive through or head to the counter
1902892 instead of getting the fries go with the apple slices many restaurants offer carrot sticks or apple slices or no sugar added applesauce or oranges which make a big difference over deep fried fries
1902893 instead of the deep fried nuggets go for something like the grilled chicken and you will save fat grams and calories
1902894 you cant go wrong with unsweetened iced tea water or a skim milk
1902895 its so sad to see that restaurants are still dishing out fried chicken hamburgers french fries grilled cheese sandwiches and soda to our kids these are generally high calories fatty salty foods and generally things kids should not be eating

1902916 this deplorable and ridiculous verdict takes me back to the incident in which i was in the most humiliating situation bound as they fired on me
1902917 this decision is far more painful and infuriating than what they did to me it cant be that instead of putting him burberg in jail for 3 4 years theyre giving him a reward saying that it doesnt matter what you do to palestinians everything is acceptable and okay
1902918 it was a crime that the entire world saw and most crimes against the palestinian people are not seen and not filmed and they are a lot worse than what i went through this verdict reminded me that israel is only being called sic a state of justice and democracy it is far from being so
1902919 there is not even a bit of truth in the israeli claim that israel is a state of justice and democracy
1902920 there is no justice in israel and no democracy and no human rights where were all these in my case the decision about lt col omri proves that these do not exist when it comes to the palestinians
1902921 i dont plan to give up i have rights and i have honor even if once again in israel theyve proven that theyre the judges and theyre the prosecutors and theyre the investigators and theyre the rulers when its all just a big show

1902994 his mission is that he has to be put to death by the romans to suffer so his blood will be the sign for redemption to come
1902995 this is the sign of the son of joseph this is the conscious view of jesus himself this gives the last supper an absolutely different meaning to shed blood is not for the sins of people but to bring redemption to israel

1903016 i ran into this shoot fighting thing and said whoa
1903017 i always thought i could whip some ass but i never really did i tried it it turned out i was good at it and i just got addicted to grappling and it took me all the way
1903018 i had just met an american girl from nebraska and her being an ex athlete a college volleyball player i just said why dont we sell everything we have and move
1903019 i saw him in chucks corner one time looked him up found the gym found an apartment close by and i started training
1903020 they laughed at me the first day but after a while i tapped a brown belt the first week so i guess they saw some potential
1903021 but the day before i read a huge article about this stud laughs i was like wow and then they tell me im fighting him well i got taken to a conditioning class the next day i kinda quit on the stool between the second and third round and john lewis did not accept that
1903022 i wasnt going anywhere the company i was with went under i couldnt get any fights for some reason and i was running out of money because that company made me quit my job and i thought i was gonna get on a roll stay busy and be a full time professional
1903023 instead i almost went bankrupt and being an engineer i figured id just go back to work and maybe come back and fight
1903024 now ive just got to go in there and win
1903025 he took him down and didnt do anything to him down there ive watched that fight 20 times and i still dont know what he was thinking but the guy whipped up on cro cop standing up so what do you take from that the guy beat up cro cop but didnt want to stand with heath to me hes got a suspect chin and im definitely gonna test it the fight starts standing up so ill test his chin hell probably test mine and if hes too good standing up ill take him down and im confident i have the edge there its probably the smartest thing to take him down but im not a wrestler so hopefully he stumbles and ill jump on him

1903030 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1903031 it is very disappointing here you have this designation as a monument and there has been less visible activity going on in the monument
1903032 it is wonderful that our nation has made a commitment and this administration deserves a lot of credit for designating the worlds largest marine reserve but there is a responsibility that goes along with that
1903033 unfortunately in recent years the u s has not made picking up trash in our most special places in the ocean a priority
1903034 decided to reduce its level of commitment to removing marine debris and only address new accumulations
1903035 the administration is not keeping pace and this is disappointing
1903036 additional cleanup and prevention resources are needed to protect this marine national monument
1903037 its asking a lot for a monument proclamation to do that but you have to start some place
1903038 we can pick up plastic off the beach from now until the end of time but unless people stop putting it in the ocean our problem will never go away

1903042 hawaiis spirit of tolerance might not have been perfect or complete but it was and is real
1903043 the opportunity that hawaii offered to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect became an integral part of my world view and a basis for the values that i hold most dear
1903044 he himself is a child of diversity and hawaii gave him that opportunity
1903045 he believes diversity defines you rather than divides you thats the central message of change hes bringing its nothing to be afraid of
1903046 im going to see my grandma who i havent seen in 18 19 months

1903074 and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
1903075 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1903076 we cant think of it in the big picture we just have to think of it as if were going to the gym and doing our job which weve all been doing for years now

1903121 budgeting at any level whether its state or local comes down to setting priorities
1903122 i want to thank majority leader skelos for coming o yonkers to restate his commitment to education funding across this state and to partner with us in solving what has been yonkers number one budgetary challenge for decades
1903123 fixing the education funding formula that has chronically shortchanged this citys students
1903124 but we wont do it at the expense of education and we have promised to work with mayor amicone councilman murtagh to finally fix an education funding formula that has hurt yonkers and other cities and towns across the state
1903125 as difficult as the challenges have been for this years budget they pale in comparison to challenges we will face next year
1903126 but there is a way to achieve fiscal stability and ensure that yonkers continues to become the great city we all know it can be we must continue an aggressive expansion of our local tax base through sustained economic development while partnering with new york state to finally solve the funding problem that has incessantly inhibited our city and school district from attaining financial independence

1903131 i have a great deal of company in my house especially in the morning when nobody calls let me suggest a few comparisons that some one may convey an idea of my situation i am no more lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs so loud or than walden pond itself i am no more lonely than a single mullein or dandelion in a pasture or a bean leaf or sorrel or a horse fly or a bumblebee
1903132 we had discussed him again when we studied gandhi and nonviolence even though the mention of mullein is a small literary reference its a nice tie in to thoreau and a chance to talk about which we previously hadnt focused on very much
1903133 i suppose its partly because its so entwined with our regular day that its a little hard to separate and describe and partly because its always evolving and morphing to suit our whims

1903147 mainly i watch the charts after youve been doing it quite awhile you get a feel for where some etfs are probably going to go
1903148 as soon as you sell it goes up but ive found that if you dont you dont protect the downside either
1903149 to me thats where things are going to have to go
1903150 i dont care much for bonds i dont understand them very well and its not what im interested in
1903151 its difficult to really know which way things are going
1903152 the market is very interesting to me i learn something all the time and i enjoy it
1903153 i thought this is neat and it got me interested in learning more

1903163 stamped on every page of her diaries and journals is a woman fully immersed in the practical realities of everyday living even as she is totally engaged in assimilating these realities through an eternal perspective it is from the tensions of these two realities the seen and the unseen that hard spiritual truths are hammered out

1903169 the result of sin is death the result of sins being dealt with is resurrection
1903170 we do know that it is not achieved by us since it comes down from heaven
1903171 this story in mark 2 1 12 has led me to believe that nothing is more important than being forgiven do you think that if you had the power to heal the sick instantaneously with a word you would bother about their forgiveness before you healed them im sure i wouldnt i would heal them straight away im sure i would say something like we can deal with their sins later however i have come to see that this is because i do not love people like jesus does he goes to the heart of their problem an even deeper and more important problem than sickness
1903172 because everyone in the new creation are all forgiven themselves the will know how to forgive and accept others it will be a wonderful world one to be longed for

1903195 when he came into the weavers to replace pete seeger which was a pretty tall order he not only did that but he brought so much of his own talents to bear that it was overwhelming it really was

1903197 of the next generation of weavers i mean he was so outstanding that it was hard then or even now to imagine who else we could have brought in other than erik
1903198 my big regret is that i didnt get to do it
1903199 i did have the chance but i didnt take advantage of it

1903201 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
1903202 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
1903203 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
1903204 obviously were disappointed not to have been at the top but as a brand we consistently rank high in many many quality studies
1903205 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
1903206 for the manufacturer its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs
1903207 in todays environment the only concern i have with prius right now is meeting expectations with availability
1903208 in the last year significant changes have been made in the way the new chrysler llc works on improving quality and customer satisfaction
1903209 those changes have already had a significant impact the cars we are selling today are greatly improved

1903226 she had been looking forward to the baptism no one seemed bothered that she was a little late but a few people from daniels side had a go at daniels house she got lots of stick and eventually had a go back but she didnt want trouble and when things got a bit too heated she left she was really upset

1903255 its all about relationships and not about religion according to this approach and while no one would deny its very much about living and loving relationships the truth of the matter is that it is a false dichotomy to separate jesus from religion or for that matter organism from organization let me give an illustration on the latter point consider for example a very simple organism indeed the single cell amoeba a form of protozoa now the amoeba is nothing if not flexible it can subdivide over and over again but within that larger flexible entity there is organization there is a nucleus for example without which it could not exist it also has pseudo pods by which it moves and vacuoles by which it maintains its equilibrium without structure order and organization it could not ever be even a viable living thing this is in fact true of all organisms and that includes the church if one wants to call it an organism that doesnt mean that human beings arent capable of over institutionalzing things or ossifying some of the structures but to pit organism over against organization with one seen as living and the other dead one god given and the other man made is absolutely a false dichotomy when it comes to the church there is no such thing in heaven or on earth as an organism without organization order structure form otherwise it would have no distinct shape purpose or being and that applies to god the church as well as to all created things remember the story of how god created the universe in a very specific order with very specific properties well its always been like that creativity takes a particular form and shape bring order out of chaos or a disparate group of elements spontaneity is not particularly more god like than something that was planned before the foundations of the world and executed over a long period of time and why we should think an organism like the church needs to normally be completely spontaneous in order to be alive is a mystery perhaps it is an over reaction to spending too much time in moribund or unwell churches one thing i know about real works of art they take time to create and care and skill and form and substance this is as true of a matisse masterpiece as of gods creation of the universe but i digress
1903256 can we agree to disagree on the issue of homosexual ordination
1903257 i say this because of what i feel is the basic issue around homosexuality it is a sin or is it not at its heart you either feel that homosexuality is a sin that takes us further from god or a gift from god that should be embraced agreeing to disagree mean that we really felt like either was possible and or are open to the possibilities i am not sure either side really is in that space again what can we live with for some issues i think this is entirely possible for me i can live with agreeing to disagree on things such as how do we engage in evangelism and mission what language we use for god our voice action in regards to the middle east positions on a myriad of social issues but when it comes to homosexuality regardless on which side of the aisle you live on how long can one be engaged in a community where the position is held in the contrary could we agree to disagree about the ordination of women could we agree to disagree about interracial marriage i dont think we could but yet for some reason we believe we can in this case
1903258 who is the 2nd most important who in bringing change

1903274 for me whats paramount is writing from a truthful place
1903275 now im finding this extreme sense of urgency to cut to the core to get to the truth it strikes me that theres a real lack of protest songwriters out there what a real opportunity this is to write about what all of us are feeling collectively to serve the role artists have served historically
1903276 a wholly inspired creative environment for me a very prolific time
1903277 not to sound too harsh but with this record im not concerned who im going to lose or pick up
1903278 because everything felt more urgent the environment a war based on deception and in general across the board people in america have become comatose or dulled out by the immense amount of information thats out there i had to take a leap of faith that a lot of people are feeling the way im feeling
1903279 it feels bigger and grander and goes to a more dramatic place
1903280 im really enjoying playing the new stuff its a collection of very intense songs and it actually even intensifies the old stuff

1903321 led this open source community that was the united states the community had been in a huge dispute over membership that had gone on since the community was founded the community could not come together he tried to sit down with those who wanted to fork the code the secessionist south and lincoln said no as a result the community went into a massive battle the bloodiest battle in our history
1903322 we have the same threats today just with different technology and in a different medium
1903323 why invest in protocols it may the cheapest security dollars we can invest
1903324 the defining issue of the 2008 elections has been the high cost of energy and the battle of ideas for energy policy in the decades to come
1903325 whether you are running for commander in chief or corporation commissioner one thing is the same your message has something to do with energy
1903326 media consultants have jettisoned their stock footage of soldiers in iraq decaying classrooms and assault rifles
1903327 we were listening to some gospel during the joshua tree sessions i remember the mighty clouds and the reverend cleveland and the staple singers the original was more loose almost jamaican bono hit on the melody and i had the title in a notebook at first no one took it that seriously because it sounded so unlike anything wed ever done and it didnt gel until the mix but when it was finished we all realized that we had something special the reviewers didnt like it though one american said it was a pale imitation of the original form and that foreigner song i want to know what love is was better
1903328 het wordt te gek jos zeg dat ze zo weer terugkomen als de microfoon gemaakt is
1903329 h koms eens hierheen ze breken het hele podium af man
1903330 de politie kan wel wat minder ruig hoor als je dat ziet met zn twintigen n jongetje

1903332 he did have an initial wellness exam apart from how obese he is his teeth look great until blood work comes back we cant say anything about choosing an adoptive family because if the cat has a thyroid condition or diabetes we want to make sure that the adoptive family would be comfortable administering any medication he may need
1903333 it really was necessary to protect princess chunk because the media had gotten so aggressive with photographers hiding out in the bushes
1903334 there is ample evidence in this case pointing to dr ivins as the individual who drove to princeton to mail those letters
1903335 when you look at the records when he was at work and he would have had time to drive he had time on relevant occasions to drive to princeton
1903336 there is also evidence concerning where that mailbox was in princeton n j connected to some obsessive conduct with regard to a sorority
1903337 weve heard both they were taking off to take people back to base camp or they were dropping someone off
1903338 apparently the aircraft came down and impacted the terrain and then rolled down the mountain and it was after continuing a roll down the mountain and the aircraft took fire
1903339 we have 12 aircraft under contract to the u s fire service
1903340 were probably the largest operator of fire fighting helicopters we fight fires here canada mexico and australia
1903341 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1903342 painstaking investigation led us to the conclusion that dr bruce e ivins was responsible for the death sickness and fear brought to our country by the 2001 anthrax mailings and it appears based on the evidence that he was acting alone
1903343 when you empower more leaders you increase the net store of energy and resources available in your organization you are not giving power and energy away you are multiplying it its like love the more you give away the more you have i want to suggest a new definition of 21
1903344 trace has been texting her randomly from his tour asking her out and congratulating her on her achievements i like to call it friendly but flirty test messaging the two have become really close friends even though they have hardly ever hung out nor ever have time to meet up due to their schedules demi does think hes totally hot and different from most of the guys shes been interested in
1903345 you better come get your uncle i just killed him
1903346 i dont pay for coffee i am an officer i get coffee for free
1903347 the family feel they need to spend time focusing on the forthcoming trial and grieving for their loss at this painful and sad time
1903348 the street peace live concert will still be taking place and will be moved to summer 2009 this also allows so many other huge artists to be involved as so many wanted to show their support by performing but due to commitments on the 21st unfortunately had to decline
1903349 we need to do something about it knife crime and this concert will show the government people care and want a change
1903350 es war traurig zu sehen dass unschuldige get tet wurden
1903351 jetzt ist er wieder frei bei seiner familie und seinen kindern
1903352 in ihm fand er eine vaterfigur und einen sinn im heiligen krieg
1903353 angesichts der fakten in diesem fall sollten sie die m glichkeit lebenslanger haft erw gen
1903354 theres no way i am going to be able to get up on that surfboard its not going to happen
1903355 damn man i am not going to be able to do this im going to get my ass kicked in surfing
1903356 the apostle paul and the introspective conscience of the west
1903357 cults and cosmic consciousness religious vision in the american 1960s
1903358 i want to be fair to the city and it might inform how they decide to handle their pool inventory
1903359 if were thinking about reallocating cip dollars from the ymca project we owe it to the city to engage them in that conversation
1903360 i know that star swimming is ready to put the shovel in right now and get going and that is very very important and we have no idea what is happening with the ymca
1903361 the board didnt outright say that if we fund one we wont fund the other
1903362 comparison with the y facility is a bit like comparing apples and oranges
1903363 their pool would be devoted solely to competitive swimming ours is a full facility y with a competition pool a warm water pool locker rooms and a fitness center among other features
1903364 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1903365 im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1903366 we offer our sincere apologies to bocog the city of beijing and the people of china if our actions were in any way offensive that was not our intent
1903367 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1903368 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing we look forward to putting this incident behind us while we prepare for our competition next week
1903369 when you train your whole life for something dot all your is and cross all your ts why wouldnt you be better safe than sorry
1903370 to protect freedom of expression freedom of religion and freedom of opinion in your country including tibet
1903371 ensure that human rights defenders are no longer intimidated or imprisoned
1903372 your decision on these issues will determine the success the olympic games and the image the world will have of china in the future
1903373 such retractions take place against a general backdrop of fear in terms of freedom of expression and censorship surrounding the beijing olympic games
1903374 they also further highlight the failure of the international olympic committee to show clear moral leadership ahead of the games
1903375 athletes should feel free to express their personal opinions on human rights without fear or favour
1903376 if you are a person whose voice resonates around the world then it is your responsibility to try and effect positive change
1903377 to me it is remarkable that we want to say athletes should shut up and just play
1903378 in everyday context they are good enough to tell us what cereals to eat what shoes to wear about anti obesity or whatever but when it comes to a fundamental tenet of human rights somehow they are not good enough
1903379 if we want them to be holistic role models then lets let them be holistic role models
1903380 the legacy of most elite athletes is to be completely vanilla
1903381 i played basketball for many years and the idea that my legacy to this world is putting a ball in a hole is unsatisfactory to me
1903382 if people are satisfied they can play a great forehand volley or make a birdie from a bunker if thats enough for them then i cannot comment
1903383 but it is not enough of a legacy when the opportunity to change the world is in your grasp
1903384 it is very convenient to suggest that human rights are political
1903385 the universal charter of human rights says that this is not the case and this is something every country of the olympic community has signed up to
1903386 i am not asking athletes to embarrass the chinese people they have worked hard i am not asking for a boycott
1903387 there have been improvements i applaud the chinese government for that and i am not demonising the people of china but they need support from people who can speak up and perhaps make an impact
1903388 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom
1903389 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
1903390 its not a big deal since you love to cook anyway
1903391 i know you just made a huge dinner for me and friends but you love it
1903392 i know this was a major effort but youd be cooking anyway
1903393 im a little dream self short and stout im the other half of bruce when he lets me out when i get all steamed up i dont pout i push bruce aside then im free to run about
1903394 the idea that anyone could say they could convict someone with what they have is stunning
1903395 they have nothing there was not a single piece of evidence produced from all those search warrants and all those affidavits he was a weird bookish nerdy kind of man but he didnt do it he was an open caring honest man with a great sense of humor who was beloved by his friends and family
1903396 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
1903397 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
1903398 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
1903399 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
1903400 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
1903401 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
1903402 look into our soldiers eyes asks no questions tells no lies is it allright no its not allright
1903403 more detailed they provide more candor and it makes the selection process quicker
1903404 the indictment charges senator stevens with a failure to disclose gifts that allegedly took the form of an automobile transfer household renovations and household goods
1903405 its not accurate to compare just because of the size of the markets
1903406 proportionately speaking i think greece is the size of beijing population wise
1903407 weve done research in ten cities throughout china and weve found most consumers have no idea who the actual official sponsors are
1903408 we found 40 percent of consumers thought coke was the sponsor versus sixty percent for pepsi
1903409 the governments going out and saying stop spitting on the street because of the olympics
1903410 theyre using the olympics really as a trigger to reform china chinese consumers have been hit regularly for a decade with olympic themed messages which makes it very difficult for the official sponsors to get their messages above the din
1903411 the one thing were not seeing is what were used to seeing
1903412 thats billboards and advertising all around us theyve just gone theyve been beamed up to planet olympics
1903413 li ning is still a small company and also a fast growing company
1903414 therefore its only be logical that li ning spends money where we can get the best return
1903415 china is the great game china is where everybody wants to be and so much of the reason people are sponsoring these games is to make a lasting impression on the chinese government and the chinese people
1903416 the more visitors we have the richer well get the more people the better
1903417 and the people are rustic its great to bring my daughter here to see this way of life
1903418 i wanted to come to shangli to see the ancient landscape
1903419 its said there are relics here dating back to the qing dynasty circa 1644 1911 those of us born after 1980 we dont know much about this so we can come here and learn from the experience and get a taste of ancient times
1903420 the water can be used to make tea if old people drink it theyll have a long life if young people drink it theyll earn more money if students drink it theyll get the top score on their exams
1903421 it really needs to eliminate many of the breeding grounds for extremism which is poverty which is hiv aids which is all of these terrible conditions that make people totally dissatisfied and then look to extremism particularly islamic extremism
1903422 i know development assistance is not the most popular of programs but as president i will make the case to the american people that it can be our best investment in increasing the common security of the entire world and increasing our own security
1903423 thats why i will double our foreign assistance to 50 billion by 2012 and use it to support a stable future in failing states and sustainable growth in africa to halve global poverty and to roll back disease
1903424 the way we are organized to deliver foreign assistance and to invest in low income countries is really quite behind the times
1903425 our apparatus was set up in the early 60s the legislation is the foreign assistance act of 1961 passed in the early days of the kennedy administration
1903426 they have both hinted at the need for reorganization but neither has been particularly explicit as to what that reorganization might look like appropriately so
1903427 its a little early to be into the specific details of what the reorganization might be but both have recognized the importance of making investments going forward
1903428 the fact of the matter is we spend almost four times as much on food aid as we do on agricultural development our investments in agricultural development have fallen precipitously over the last many years there is no one on first to track that and watch that
1903429 the defense was just young the defense was just young georgia just won because of the celebration the defense was just young
1903430 this new waves coming in dont know where to begin brand new trophies to win brand new ways to fit in
1903431 fred flare has a knack of finding the hippest product from artists and companies around the world this fun watch imported from japan is not only cool looking it tells the time in japanese impress you friends with your new language okay so maybe its just speaking the time but its japanese
1903432 she just seems like shes in shock things keep piling up every day new rumors new problems and shes saying she cant see the light at the end of the tunnel
1903433 he was really into the music dancing around the whole time
1903434 i saw him do a shot of whiskey at the bar with another guy it was the only round of shots i saw him do the entire night
1903435 the kids were all so excited to have mommy home
1903436 brad planned a little celebration for her and the twins the first night they were back all the kids had presents for the babies and for mom
1903437 its unusual to be able to completely conceal a mole that size with makeup
1903438 she loves these boys so much she was willing to give up the fight
1903439 she put her hands on her tummy patted it gently and gave a huge smile
1903440 jens being very careful not to freak out john with too much talk about babies and marriage
1903441 by the end of september she should be back to her pre baby weight
1903442 buy a house before you have kids or youll rent forever
1903443 it doesnt matter how much you hear about the experience you have no idea what its like until you actually go through it
1903444 if you wait to be financially ready or have the perfect job youll never have kids
1903445 dont worry if you can afford to feed and clothe a child or have time to care for him youll manage
1903446 we need to assess if our battery technology is ready for the united states
1903447 investigating the factors that contribute to diga dollar success in video games
1903448 diga is now delivering on its initial promise the industry has proven growth over the last three years with healthy forecasts for further growth through 2012 and beyond
1903449 advertisers and media agencies strive for innovation and content rich advertising solutions for their brands of which diga has increasingly become a valuable component
1903450 in game advertising is an essential component of the evolving business models for monetizing games on all platforms and that makes the topic a perfect fit for gcdc
1903451 our goal is to present a program that meets the needs of the global interactive entertainment community and mr welchs presentation will be an excellent addition to our line up
1903452 we heard loud shattering glass and the next thing we saw a bunch of smoke in the air they took the fire extinguishers and started running around the parking lot we actually ran after the little kids that did it and they took off
1903453 was the first public indication that these disclosures unique to california are considered settlement services
1903454 i share huds view that natural hazard disclosure reports have always been a settlement service subject to respa
1903455 the argument that they are not has always seemed to me to be patently frivolous
1903456 a dramatic example of how the government and the real estate industry are working together to establish new practices for california home buyers and sellers
1903457 requiring a significant change in every escrow companys standard procedures
1903458 to avoid the continuing legal expense and potential business disruption of these lawsuits
1903459 obviously the insurance companies pushed to settle or property i d would have fought this all the way to the end to a jury trial

1903462 if you look at our local water body stormwater or runoff from storms is the primary water pollution problem in this community
1903463 were having problems with human and animal waste e coli and fecal coliforms in the rivanna main stream in the north fork rivanna preddy creek meadow creek mechums and beaver creek
1903464 so for example if the 30 day or 365 day limit is about to expire just look at your watch go out and move some dirt around and you basically kick the time limit in all over again
1903465 this is an example this kind of report of what makes this such a great community because we have groups that come in and at their own time and expense put together something like this which is exceptionally helpful
1903466 i dont think its appropriate at this stage to attempt to impeach two presidents consecutively
1903467 are we in favor of immunizing people who worked in the white house in the last eight years from accountability for criminal acts i dont think anyone should be in favor of that
1903468 i f we dont protect these people who are proceeding in good faith no one will ever take chances
1903469 giving the country clotheslines laden with dirty linen and encouraging the voters to smell the stench and make up their own minds
1903470 u ntil we know the entire story of the conduct of the war on terror a new story with america reassuming a believable role as a guarantor of human rights cant really begin
1903471 we are glad to see the achievements the city has made so far it has made public transport more convenient upgraded home heating methods reduced to some degree its reliance on fossil fuel and improved water treatment

1903478 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the atlantic ocean
1903479 typically when you have strong activity during july thats also a very strong indicator the remainder of the season will be above normal
1903480 the place was absolutely soaked with gasoline obviously the intent was to set the apartment on fire
1903481 madonna walks in later that day looking very sad and disoriented i would say she is drunk but she doesnt drink she says lets start from the beginning and gets what we call her dita gear on and gets a hold of her whip she cant even balance herself on stage and nikki harris her backup singer suggests to madonna that she sit down for a little bit madonna then walks over to nikki and starts hitting her with the whip while crying her guts out nikki is shocked at first but then screams what are you doing madonna then drops to the ground face first all of us look at madonna then each other then at madonna again we noticed that she has pooped in her dita outfit and think she is dead despite being bitchwhipped by madonna nikki harris is the first person to run over to her shes got a pulse nikki indicates and turns madonna over
1903482 i would love to see a feature where you list what you personally use call it pogues list or something it would be great to see what someone as plugged in as you uses personally everything tech watch laptop tv car digital camera film camera like that
1903483 the sound quality amazing the screen is brilliant and i took some sample shots with the 2 megapixel camera and found it even better than my own lg
1903484 the darned thing is so thin and slick its hard to hold a rigid thin slab is not actually very easy to hold in your round fleshy palm
1903485 if i had to it over again i would not have bought this expensive classy impractical two seater roadster id have bought the toyota camry that my wife did the lg8300 its a nearly perfect cellphone
1903486 will only be a scripted political performance guarded by walls of heavily armed riot police as party insiders and corporate lobbyists live it up behind closed doors

1903489 today its not considered one of his best but when i heard it i thought i was listening to something like i never heard before the funny thing was i didnt know much about neil young at all when i took it out i just thought the cover was cool from there i walked back to the library took out decade and comes a time and that was that he became my favorite singer songwriter and guitarist

1903491 all the focus has been on the level one merchants the high street and multi national retailers and making sure they are compliant with pci dss
1903492 the smaller retailers handling hundreds of thousands or low millions of transactions are more exposed because they have not been pushed down that path to the same extent there has not been a lot of pressure and enforcement to ensure that they are keeping to the pci dss
1903493 we are as likely to see attacks in the uk as the us or any wealthy western country where there is ample credit cards with a good credit limit
1903494 there is a good chance that there is a lot more insecure technology down among those low level merchants
1903495 and this is the level at which there are going to be a large number of retailers as opposed to the comparatively small number of level one retailers
1903496 barclays cdos are of a slightly older vintage than merrills
1903497 we are trying to find allies for our position especially among new member states its possible to form a blocking minority and we are working on this
1903498 the french eu presidency will try to close this topic so we need to be even more active in defending our cause which is economic development
1903499 the negotiations are ongoing we cant allow a situation in which we are forced to limit co2 emissions without being able to invest in our own energy security
1903500 it is not going to be too terribly detrimental for them
1903501 it may just be a few cents but citi will have to step in and eat it and it will be a charge
1903502 to be able to take one of these problems that citi is wrestling with and begin to put it behind them is actually a positive
1903503 citi being the first provided the template for many other companies to follow suit
1903504 im just looking at it as one race at a time i would love to be in the top four the last night but its not something im pressuring myself to do im putting more pressure on myself to be as clean as i can
1903505 when we started i drove three new horses with one broke horse at every show so we got a bunch of nice new horses going when we got around to high river right before calgary i sorted through them and decided this is the crew i wanted for calgary
1903506 theyre not clicking as outfits in the barrels because theyre just a bunch of horses thrown together and you dont have the smoothness in the barrels but theyve got a ton of run and a ton of finish
1903507 theyve passed or caught pretty near everybody ive been hooked with and thats kind of nice
1903508 you get in them good heats turn slower and run behind those outfits that are really running youre out of the traffic and you should be able to stay clean easier

1903521 a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the west today
1903522 political and intellectual functionaries exhibit this depression passivity and perplexity in their actions and in their statements and even more so in their self serving rationales as to how realistic reasonable and intellectually and even morally justified it is to base state policies on weakness and cowardice
1903523 must one point out that from ancient times a decline in courage has been considered the first symptom of the end
1903524 when the modern western states were being formed it was proclaimed as a principle that governments are meant to serve man and that man lives in order to be free and pursue happiness
1903525 every citizen has been granted the desired freedom and material goods in such quantity and in such quality as to guarantee in theory the achievement of happiness in the debased sense of the word which has come into being during those same decades
1903526 the individuals independence from many types of state pressure has been guaranteed the majority of the people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about it has become possible to raise young people according to these ideals preparing them for and summoning them toward physical bloom happiness and leisure the possession of material goods money and leisure toward an almost unlimited freedom in the choice of pleasures
1903527 even biology tells us that a high degree of habitual well being is not advantageous to a living organism today well being in the life of western society has begun to take off its pernicious mask
1903528 in america i have received letters from highly intelligent persons maybe a teacher in a faraway small college who could do much for the renewal and salvation of his country but the country cannot hear him because the media will not provide him with a forum this gives birth to strong mass prejudices to a blindness which is perilous in our dynamic era an example is the self deluding interpretation of the state of affairs in the contemporary world that functions as a sort of petrified armor around peoples minds to such a degree that human voices from seventeen countries of eastern europe and eastern asia cannot pierce it it will be broken only by the inexorable crowbar of events
1903529 of course a society cannot remain in an abyss of lawlessness as is the case in our country
1903530 all this is visible to numerous observers from all the worlds of our planet the western way of life is less and less likely to become the leading model
1903531 there are telltale symptoms by which history gives warning to a threatened or perishing society
1903532 but the fight for our planet physical and spiritual a fight of cosmic proportions is not a vague matter of the future it has already started the forces of evil have begun their decisive offensive you can feel their pressure yet your screens and publications are full of prescribed smiles and raised glasses what is the joy about

1903534 it has made man the measure of all things on earth imperfect man who is never free of pride self interest envy vanity and dozens of other defects
1903535 we have placed too much hope in politics and social reforms only to find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession our spiritual life it is trampled by the party mob in the east by the commercial one in the west this is the essence of the crisis the split in the world is less terrifying than the similarity of the disease afflicting its main sections
1903536 to have so many riders representing their countries at the olympics a showcase event is truly exceptional for team columbia its actually made it a little tricky finding riders for all the usual competitions

1903543 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
1903544 3d is going to become more and more pervasive and we need to know how to carry it all the way from the theater into your home and what products will be best for the consumer in the end
1903545 after reviewing the facts it was clear this request did not meet the criteria in the law
1903546 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
1903547 the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
1903548 granting this waiver will provide much needed relief to families while enabling texas to continue feeding and fueling the nation

1903550 he wasnt the greatest admirer of americans and it didnt go down too easily that one of them should be playing the starring role
1903551 parts of it he acknowledged were quite realistic but then he felt it turned into something that was completely untrue
1903552 a lot of the reality of digging tunnels was left out too
1903553 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
1903554 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis
1903555 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
1903556 and that series is very research intensive so were doing research now to see if we cant come up with another object for him to chase hopefully well come up with something
1903557 i like when you focus on making movies you make movies and people go to see them

1903559 do not stay on the same bus on the same train on the same plane in the same buildings or any place the chinese are
1903560 they are implying that anyone who is complicit with the chinese regime is a legitimate target
1903561 the reason for the increased propaganda from tip at this time is likely due to the fact that the international medias attention on the olympics in china provides the group with the perfect platform to publicize their existence and activities on a global scale
1903562 i think what theyre doing is theyre trying to capitalize on the buildup to the games
1903563 we expected that as the checks fade so would sales
1903564 consumers are filling up their suvs their home equity values are plummeting and theyre feeling a lot of pressures
1903565 because someone uploaded it theres no moderation theres no way to guarantee it wont turn bad

1903567 the outlook for small fuel efficient vehicles is much brighter today versus a year ago and the outlook on suvs has changed dramatically in the other direction
1903568 the no 1 influence is certainly a vehicle brand and the perception of the brand
1903569 the used car buyer is looking for a vehicle thats not going to be a maintenance headache for them if you have a strong brand that has a real positive influence on the residual value
1903570 declining real estate market values caused by the sub prime lending crisis means that consumers are not being able to borrow against the equity in their homes and are searching for other sources of funding

1903572 people tend to be very rational when it comes to lending their own money
1903573 the housing market is continuing to act as a drag on the economy
1903574 this is a monumental moment in what has been a 10 year process in bringing a desalination project to carlsbad

1903579 in addition 10 4 percent an estimated 17 8 million persons reported being tested in the preceding 12 months and 23 percent of persons who acknowledged having hiv risk factors reported being tested in the preceding 12 months
1903580 the data in this report suggest that progress in hiv testing stalled in the mid to late 1990s and new strategies such as expanded screening in health care settings appear to be warranted
1903581 early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection enables infected persons to obtain medical care that can improve the quality and length of their lives and adopt behaviors to prevent further hiv transmission

1903590 the perception is its a childless white couple that adopts from overseas but thats not what i found
1903591 more women get custody of children in divorce cases so after a divorce the mom is living with her kids and she meets a man and they get married and he adopts her children
1903592 this is the very first national data weve had on mens lifetime adoption experiences

1903597 i do think 15 20 years ago it was much more just go sit on the beach
1903598 these days people are looking for more and more activities to do
1903599 ask yourself is there opportunity each day for ambulatory exercise
1903600 if you can walk and do interesting things thats great i love vacations where you go to a place that lends itself to a lot of walking florence for example you can walk the entire city
1903601 its no fun to be the odd duck in a bunch of people who are fitness enthusiasts and you cant keep up
1903602 think about what the community activities are if you cant do something dont do it but find something alternative to do
1903603 you are not going to get many psychological or social benefits from it dont have a lot of things to check off and dont over plan consider whether that third child might be better off with the grandparents

1903609 iles des saintes is very french with small hotels no big developments and lush beautiful beaches
1903610 we used to go there six or seven years ago before they got some major impact from hurricane activities that destroyed landings and led to beach erosion but now its been restored
1903611 germans like to say sylt is our version of the hamptons
1903612 its a high profile destination in germany but it manages to stay pretty laid back at the same time there are empty beaches good biking and walking paths and a few small villages with traditional north sea style houses
1903613 we are at a distinct advantage over our land based resort partners since we can move and they cant
1903614 whether its geo political weather or consumer interest and tastes that are changing we can alter our itineraries and go to places that are unique cool or different

1903662 this is not to say that obama lacks substance or has not delivered enough wonky policy speeches neither is close to the case however his poetic call to renewal on caucus night made clear that he was making an argument in this presidential race not just presenting a laundry list where most democratic presidential candidates seem to be running for head of government barack obama is running for head of state thats why their speeches sound like a state of the union his sound like an inaugural address

1903681 i hoped that the measures could have more effect than they had in the last week
1903682 unfortunately we had meteorological conditions that werent good for clearing up the sky so the stagnant air in beijing has helped pollutants accumulate i really hope in the next couple weeks well have conditions that will help us clear up the sky
1903683 we have to remember that its not short term exposure thats of concern its the long term
1903684 for us its important to see how these environmental efforts are sustained
1903685 when were talking about darfur were talking about a humanitarian issue
1903686 there are hundreds of thousands of people who are right now in dire peril
1903687 as it was said to me today if these games were in any country other than china i would probably be there right now
1903688 and the message basically was were revoking your visa and we dont have to give you any reason why
1903689 team darfur has been critical of the role china has played in that conflict
1903690 but we have always followed the absolute letter of the law when it comes to ioc international olympic committee rules
1903691 one was to be a supporter of all the athletes that have joined team darfur in whatever role that may be
1903692 and i dont know what it could have been because we dont really know what to expect
1903693 im sure thats the way they feel but i think its actually part of a much broader effort
1903694 every athlete who joins team darfur does so because they want to help out other people they want to use their electric spotlight to give help to other folks so i think there is a broad effort in china to keep people quiet if they dont think that they are going to like what you say
1903695 i think hes real proof of how this u s team looks at the world and what a great open mind they have about so many of these stories
1903696 but i still have to say when we talk about the olympics its more than just a sporting event to many of us to many olympians we think of it as a celebration of humanity and how many more lopezes are there in areas all over the world not just darfur unfortunately youre not even allowed to speak about that
1903697 we were disturbed to learn that the chinese had refused his visa we are taking the matter very seriously we hope they change their minds
1903698 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1903699 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1903700 any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
1903701 offer the opportunity for transformation to a more optimal state of being or productivity

1903740 lebanon is the captive of an iranian strategy that is being implemented by hizbullah
1903741 these weapons are part of a broader regional strategy hizbullah is part of irans strategy and nothing else the entire situation will change if iran reconciles with the west
1903742 as long as this is the case the truce that was achieved in doha will continue to be under threat
1903743 hizbullahs arms are the core problem in lebanon all other problems are marginal compared to it
1903744 in the eyes of international law the shebaa farms belong to syria which in turn did not present any documents to the un supporting lebanons claim

1903764 wardeh was a special meeting place because of its unique beiruti architecture it also served typical national dishes in a homely intimate setting when it closes we will lose one of beiruts beautiful faces lasting friendships have been formed here
1903765 we might find another place with good services but nowhere will have the same homely atmosphere and beautiful architecture as walimet wardeh
1903766 has already been in contact with nato and the spanish us and uk governments
1903767 once again this government has shown that its words and commitments are meaningless and they have no intention of keeping to their word
1903768 the continued construction in the west bank and in jerusalem is another death blow to the annapolis process
1903769 we can confirm that a delegation of visiting british diplomats were attacked in their car by a small group of israeli settlers while visiting in hebron
1903770 there were no injuries the israeli police intervened and we are assisting then with their investigation of the incident
1903771 iran has a way out if they ever wish but we will seriously pursue sanctions if they dont
1903772 have agreed that while informal contacts between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian negotiator saeed jalili will continue we now have no choice but to pursue further sanctions against iran as part of our dual track strategy
1903773 we are dealing with it through other channels measures have already been taken and we will follow them up if necessary and if appropriate
1903774 we wanted to organize a peaceful demonstration our protesters were only armed with slogans and portraits of the president the police stopped us by firing tear gas
1903775 i will work to solve all the problems this country is confronted with
1903776 supervise the holding of presidential polls enabling the relaunch of the democratic process in the country and to reshape it on a perennial basis
1903777 these elections which will be held in the shortest possible period will be free and transparent and will bring for the future a continued and harmonious functioning of all the constitutional powers
1903778 the current situation is unacceptable a military coup of this nature is unacceptable against a democratically elected president
1903779 coup detat how did we get back to the starting point
1903780 we need to build a new strategic involvement with popular voices in somalia
1903781 we have suffered three major terrorist attacks in our short history we will not allow a fourth one to happen
1903782 security agencies are on the alert to ensure that this tragedy will not occur again
1903783 reinforces the need to confront the terrorists to work with our allies to bring them to justice and to prevent such attacks from happening again
1903784 the attacks in kenya and tanzania remind us that al qaeda and its terrorist affiliates continue to want to attack the united states and our allies
1903785 have thwarted a number of planned attacks against kenyan and american targets
1903786 the coalition believes it is imperative to move for impeachment against general musharraf
1903787 the presidents options are either to issue an order dissolving the national assembly or impose emergency rule under which the government will be suspended and a new caretaker set up would be announced
1903788 the democracy is not that weak now that the threat can be used
1903789 his policies have weakened the federation and eroded trust in national institutions
1903790 the incompetence and failure of his policies has thrown the country into the worst power shortage in its history
1903791 the coalition doesnt have the numbers they are fooling the people
1903792 there remain worries in the south that the european interest is more self centered helping them keep their poor at home to reduce illegal immigration and to work against terrorism and organized crime
1903793 lebanon chose to carry out projects in reconstruction and infrastructure
1903794 but paid little attention to proposals in the fields of human rights social development or the environment
1903795 a bi regional center for research will give lebanon more influence and opportunities especially for students to study abroad
1903796 i do not foresee this project creating lots of new employment in particular but it will definitely increase opportunities for important educational and cultural exchanges
1903797 the well established network of good universities in lebanon gives an added value compared to the other member countries
1903798 would strengthen cooperation between participating countries starting with a joint science project is easier as science unites people it does not separate them
1903799 something that would improve and increase the accessibility of burj hammouds shopping district and create more middle class living space
1903800 not only for the commercial vitality of burj hammoud but also for the moral consciousness of the greater armenian community
1903801 most families in the camp reported that they were receiving about 3 000 5 000 compensation from the municipality
1903802 the municipality was paying more than the value of the current homes
1903803 improvement that will help burj hammoud evolve and continue to thrive
1903804 will continue to ignore the social and economic factors that have contributed to the persistence of this armenian refugee camp for over 60 years
1903805 south lebanon is living in peace and harmony and israeli air and sea violations of lebanons sovereignty are the only source of disturbance
1903806 we are grateful for the eu position during the summer 2006 war from day one the eu was pushing for a cease fire
1903807 for me its a great pleasure to be in beirut on the invitation of speaker berri
1903808 we have discussed a broad range of challenges what the eu can do what the european parliament can do
1903809 it is my ambition as president of parliament to promote with all modest means of course the peace process in the middle east
1903810 i am personally and deeply convinced that a peace in the middle east to solve the palestine problems which is one of the core questions is really decisive for the relations between the european union and the muslim and arab world
1903811 i am always aware of the situation but it is our political ambition to make the development possible that we are not afraid
1903812 i found that it was convenient to visit lebanon during this period and i will head from here to syria where i am scheduled to meet syrian president bashar assad and you all know that president sleiman will also be visiting syria next week
1903813 the eu will play its full role in reviving the peace process in the region on both the political and economic levels
1903814 we are committed to helping lebanon in becoming a sovereign state which embraces many cultures and religions
1903815 we hope syria takes some steps to enhance the peace process

1903865 after reviewing the facts it was clear this request did not meet the criteria in the law the rfs remains an important tool in our ongoing efforts to reduce americas greenhouse gas emissions and lessen our dependence on foreign oil in aggressive yet practical ways
1903866 we are deeply disappointed that epa has failed to recognize the very clear signs that the food to fuel policy is causing severe harm to the economy
1903867 the real obama promises higher taxes more government spending so fewer jobs
1903868 renewable energy to transform our economy create jobs and energy independence thats john mccain
1903869 john mccain couldve been the deciding vote on this issue twice something that wouldve truly helped americas workers and moved us toward energy independence but he was the only senator who didnt even bother to show up and vote and just last week john mccains allies in the senate blocked extending these energy incentives twice because they were determined to hold congress hostage in order to push the bush mccain big oil energy agenda at all costs

1903909 it would appear to be a targeted shooting but the young man involved was not the target it is a possibility that these two men were the intended targets he is merely a young lad going down the road into a shop with his brothers and cousin and was hit by a bullet

1903984 if your not in t i s personal dressing room with a carton of magnums i dont care
1903985 el cuerpo de su chofer apareci con flores rojas en la boca
1903986 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
1903987 lazyness as a tangible thing as something i could feel or touch or recognize approaching so i thought id make a note of it lol again dont mind me im weird
1903988 i have to do something wither i have theses bins and stuff or not i have to do something
1903989 the militants who were moving in three speed boats opened fire on sighting the naval men who were on a routine patrol
1903990 the naval gunboats in self defense engaged the militants in a gun battle which left some militants dead
1903991 i can do this so what if im not that good at singing and we havent rehearsed any songs
1903992 come sit here my hero and have a bowl of cornflakes
1903993 absolutely just give me the chance i would love to be daredevil
1903994 even im bored while making this movie so i cant imagine that anyone would ever want to actually watch it
1903995 im not sure what sherrods all fired up about maybe shes back on the pills i dont know i guess she does make a semi valid point because the script seemed kind of formulaic to me too you know the routine lonely girl cant find anyone because shes half past crazy crazy and lonely girl meets a seemingly normal guy guy ends up having an extensive criminal past and might even be dealing in crystal meth guy tries to straighten up his act for girl girl accepts him for what he is guy cleans out girls checking account and steals all her worldly belongings while she goes to her real job during the day the end weve all seen that one a million times havent we
1903996 sherrod cody needs to look in the mirror and realize that shes no longer the hot commodity she was during the 80s i blake brandon was one of the few people in this town that was even willing to work with her and now you can probably see why yeah i know the script isnt good and the entire thing will likely end up going straight to dvd from whence it will be available at your local discount store in the 1 bin i know that but im just trying to get in the good graces of the brothers weinstein so that theyll greenlight this pet project of my own a biographical about the life of matthew lesko
1903997 oh you dont know who lesko is well what about if i told you that hes the wacky guy always on commercials wearing the suit with all the question marks on it yeah youd know who he is then
1903998 its kind of funny that sherrod cody would complain about bad roles and not getting what she wants look at me i had to star in the off broadway production about the life of tim meadows to get here i cant tell you how many times i cried in my dressing room before i had to go back on stage and relive that leon phelps the ladies man scene even meryl streep is starring in mamma mia and no one ever heard a peep out of her about that i mean she couldnt possibly have wanted that role
1903999 i just dont understand why i have to be in this absolute dog of a film that blake brandon is trying to disguise as a romantic comedy wheres the romance wheres the comedy i cant imagine anyone actually wanting to see this movie i think its terrible and im actually in the movie
1904000 i guess sherrod and farrow are up for another afternoon of binging and purging
1904001 did you know that shaquille oneal was 68 1 in high school i am that one

1904004 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution
1904005 in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us
1904006 these things i have spoken unto you that in me yea might have peace in the world yea shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the word
1904007 never argue with an idiot first they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with their experience
1904008 people can do what they want as long as they stay from children and animals
1904009 now i live in the real world i can forget about fantasies like animals and so on they were just there to keep me company when i was lonely
1904010 no i dont want to be a part of this
1904011 what if i slowly pulled away i dont know i really dont know
1904012 maybe i need to free myself from him a bit not only because he likes animals a bit too much but also for my own sake learn how to let other people in too i dont want to lose him his friendship but do we really have that much in common anymore i mean hes got a boyfriend and hes much more openminded than most people i feel like im at a crossroad and dont know what road to take maybe weve outgrown one another but just clinging to the past
1904013 i think we should take a break and see where this leads us maybe i can learn to accept it or maybe not i hope i can because as you said weve been through a lot of crap and it would be a shame if our friendship ended
1904014 i dont think youre as anti as before maybe for the thing in itself but for you it still feels too dirty to think about

1904020 the most romantic chapter in the history of the propagation of the coffee plant
1904021 that for more than a month i was obliged to share my scanty ration with the plant upon which my happiest hopes were founded and which was the source of my delight
1904022 from this single plant martinique supplied seed directly or indirectly to all the countries of the americas except brazil french guiana and surinam e
1904023 consequently the whole genetic base of the arabica coffee industry is very narrow
1904024 raw coffee beans are the seeds of plants belonging to the rubiaceae family which comprises at least 66 species of the genus coffea
1904025 the two species that are commercially exploited are coffea arabica which accounts for two thirds of world production and c offea canephora often called robusta coffee with one third of global output

1904042 i am not sure you can measure her value to our village what would we use as a guide she touches so many people in so many ways and in so many different walks of life when i drive down the streets of our village and see a business a church a school or a recreation facility i think of verna and how she was partially responsible for their existence
1904043 the generosity of our students staff and faculty has been amazing
1904044 they all gave from their hearts and pockets at all levels for a student who makes minimum wage to donate five dollars to ten dollars is very special
1904045 they the soldiers are very grateful and wanted for me to say thank u and god bless all of u

1904078 people whose sole aim is to be happy turn out to be self centered discontented and restless but if your goal is to create something beautiful achieve something worthwhile or provide some service and if you work toward such a commitment happiness is a by product
1904079 remember this that very little is needed to make a happy life
1904080 for yesterday is but a dream and tomorrow is only a vision but today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope look well therefore to this day
1904081 learn how to be happy with what you have while you pursue all that you want
1904082 most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be

1904130 the baby boomers are moving through the belly of the beast and are coming out 65
1904131 the numbers are just overwhelming about 7 000 geriatricians for millions of older people
1904132 we are in a significant crisis it is no longer looming
1904133 the manpower deficit extends from the physician level to the frontline workers and everywhere in between
1904134 we really live in a youth culture this is also true for medical education
1904135 people naturally prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude
1904136 older people and ageing are not seen as sexy topics and oftentimes the people on foundation boards are ageing and this can be painful to think about they are in denial themselves
1904137 ageing is not a niche funding area or a special interest group the number of funders with a primary focus on ageing like our close friends at the john a hartford foundation will always be finite though it too needs to grow
1904138 but the number of foundations which ought to be concerned with ageing is almost infinite for no funder ought to get away in this day and well age with saying we dont do ageing
1904139 we are not in the business of training people to become geriatricians we are in business of training all physicians no matter what field they enter to better care for frail older people so it includes both faculty and practising physicians
1904140 medical never never land ten reasons why america is not ready for the coming age boom
1904141 the population numbers clearly point to older patients dominating the healthcare delivery in the us and most of the developed world but we have been rather phobic about geriatrics geriatric medicine and ageing
1904142 the internal medicine is really complicated and really interesting rarely is it just heart failure it could be heart failure plus diabetes plus depressive disorder plus cataracts
1904143 geriatric medicine remains an under subscribed field for people coming out of medical school
1904144 yet if you do anything other than paediatrics you will be seeing mostly older people

1904162 allowing employees to work from home and telecommute poses security and privacy risks that are not being addressed adequately by business or government according to a study released tuesday by consulting firm ernst amp young in partnership with the washington based advocacy group center for democracy and technology
1904163 but as weve all heard most accidents happen in the home the tennessee supreme court recently addressed for the first time the issue of whether workers compensation coverage extends to employees working in home offices
1904164 high gas prices are making many more people consider working from home the idea is to save some money on gas and as an added benefit to be kinder to the environment but in fact telecommuting is often worse for the planet than driving to work each and every day
1904165 there are so many possible permutations of a telecommuting home life the imponderables are impossible to call but everybody will have to adjust and some will not like the changes
1904166 i recently ran across a press release from korn ferry international with the headline 61 of executives surveyed believe telecommuters are less likely to advance compared to employees working in traditional office settings
1904167 more people are telecommuting i doubt that overall attitudes have changed much in the interim
1904168 they found that 60 percent of the 350 employers who responded favor pursuing telecommuting to help keep or recruit workers and to cut fuel costs he said in addition 37 percent of those companies would be likely to develop telecommuting programs if 4 a gallon gasoline hit 5
1904169 but as experience with telecommuting has accumulated doubts about some of its reputed benefits have begun to surface for instance korn ferry a recruiting firm based in los angeles finds the careers of telecommuters are believed to stagnate as out of sight translates into out of mind
1904170 requests for therapists increased 15 percent to 20 percent in the last three months primarily driven by concerns about the financial situation
1904171 mediation of all types of workplace disputes can happen at any stage in the life cycle of the conflict intervention via informal mediation by an impartial third party works and can easily be measured as a cost effective tool
1904172 many things on lifehacker are my way of counseling myself the whole point of thinking about this low level rubber to the road stuff is to get to the bigger questions of where you want to be and then to analyze if a task serves your larger goal
1904173 department stores have become retails dinosaurs i dont know if theyll survive
1904174 department stores just arent the thing for shoppers in their 20s and 30s
1904175 the department stores felt they had to have restaurants some of which made money but many which didnt they had to have fashion shows sponsor parades offer free delivery free alterations free baby sitting
1904176 people used to gauge their cities by their department stores
1904177 department stores provided an environment that was one stop shopping
1904178 consumers began seeing all the department stores carrying all the same brands when they wanted different products and different brands
1904179 when federated department stores acquired may department stores in 2005 that really shook up the department stores
1904180 that was the inspiration for changes in the department stores merchandise assortment they began adopting the practice of the specialty stores offering exclusive brands and their own private brands to differentiate themselves from the competition
1904181 penneys partnership with skin hair care fragrance and makeup retailer sephora by penneys own data shows its brought customers into the store
1904182 its very important that retailers become engaged with the consumer

1904185 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
1904186 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
1904187 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
1904188 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
1904189 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do

1904438 very surprisingly abbey who is not a dominant female went up to brighter and gently took bolo off her and placed her on her chest
1904439 what was surprising was that brighter didnt try to take bolo back it was obvious to everyone that abbey was much more protective than brighter ever was and that was the kind of protection we were looking for
1904440 this gives abbey and the other females a chance to experience aspects of motherhood which is a really important thing for gorillas
1904441 when they havent got that they get bored and might display unnatural behavior having bolo in the group is a very calming influence

1904491 not as clear to the court as it is to defendant
1904492 merit based defense s not properly before the court at this stage
1904493 the focus of class certification is properly on the typicality of the plaintiffs claim as it applies to the general liability issues and not on the plaintiffs ultimate ability to recover
1904494 the controversy is over a contract of insurance that is standardized over hundreds of thousands of north carolinians the interpretation of such standardized agreement on a class wide basis will provide certainty and prevent inconsistent adjudications
1904495 nothing of this type has been constructed for more than 10 years in this area
1904496 we are doing it in three or four separate phases with the first phase already under construction it will have 242 000 square feet of industrial which is still in strong demand there will also be 175 000 square feet of office so the first phase is not all that large relative to the size of the market

1904501 watkins glen has always been a so so track for me
1904502 weve had decent runs but dont really have the solid finishes to show for it we had a good test at road atlanta a few weeks ago to prepare for this weekend were taking the same car we took to sonoma and i think the car was pretty good out there we just had some bad luck that day
1904503 its good for a driver good for the team and good for the people back in the shop you could lose 50 straight races and win one and its like you forget about all that stuff
1904504 its a relief and it feels so good because of how hard it is to win these races for a driver and the whole team and company i think winning races and running up front is as much of a confidence builder that you can have in racing
1904505 the best way for us to make the chase is to remain consistent with our race car each and every race
1904506 its a tough battle right now for us to come out of pocono and gain two positions in the chase is a credit to team director kenny francis and all the guys that work on this budweiser dodge theres still a lot of racing left but pocono was a good weekend for gillett evernham and all the guys that work on our team
1904507 cars for comrades is a richly and eclectically documented volume in addition to a wealth of archival material siegelbaum considers a variety of pop culture sources ranging from propaganda posters to literature to the pages of the soviet car aficionado magazine behind the wheel za rul m this approach provides a sustained and detailed picture of how cars and trucks fit into the soviet economy and its cultural mindset and how this fit varied over time for example the regime sought early on to popularize car driving via auto rallies races and exhibitions but at the same time made very few provisions roads service stations garage space to make private ownership a consumer friendly proposition as private cars ultimately became more available the horror stories associated with such ownership seemed to multiply this book is replete with tales of bribery on the road and at the gas station and of owners whose lives came to be consumed by the search for spare parts or by the constant need to prevent the theft of existing parts such as windshield wiper blades
1904508 the washington post was given access to the written record by a participant of several private meetings attended by mugabe in the period between the first round of voting and the runoff election the notes were corroborated by witnesses to the internal debates many of the people interviewed including members of mugabes inner circle spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of government retribution much of the reporting for this article was conducted by a zimbabwean reporter for the post whose name is being withheld for security reasons

1904517 our responsibility is to seek out a solution so that we can influence those collective decision makers so that we can become those elected decision makers so that we can have power over public policy with the stroke of a pen
1904518 when she called me i thought she wanted me to consult on the campaign not be her vp not saying that i am not ready i wasnt overwhelmed with the task this is a historical moment for the hip hop generation and its not an ego thing its just the truth and that means a lot
1904519 average brothers and sisters on the street the real working class the real people that work two jobs and still fall under the poverty line
1904520 im a huge fan of political diversity whether or not they get a lot of votes american democracy should have a lot of depth
1904521 it is in the interest of the other two major parties to put the green party in a box and say they are only interested in the environment but the green party has taken a stand for reparations and for descendants of the enslaved in this country they have taken a stand against police brutality and racial profiling they have acknowledged the fact that this country was built on genocide of the indigenous people in this country so the green party is also a justice party a peace party a democracy party of course it is a party for respect for this planet that gives us life but that is not all that this party is
1904522 i keep saying the green party is not an alternative its now the imperative for our survival i really believe that
1904523 this is what i get for wandering central park at night

1904529 and second the ability to put material in a bin without actually copying them to a centralized media folder
1904530 most of these areas are already fixed up so giving away taxes in order to get construction is not a good city use so what were doing in actuality is using a development program to try and get more moderate price people into areas that are more expensive
1904531 it is important to adapt tools to changing city dynamics and that is why the goals have evolved from spurring development to affordability and growth management it is worth noting that no new multi family projects have been approved since affordability requirements were established
1904532 the louisa as you clearly point out on page 7 of your report project monitoring was not specified in the old code under which this project was approved center commons pdc is researching this project to determine the complete details of the transfer of each of these units to the initial and current homeowner
1904533 i am confident many of these units would not have been constructed without these incentive programs
1904534 we are not specifically reserving the units for those low income people
1904535 i think that were well within our rights to do that
1904536 the city of portland has decided to evict us from our flagship store location which is located at the corner of sw 10th amp morrison
1904537 axelrods strategy has been to promote a personality not issues perhaps this is why obamas campaign speeches have been more like saturday night live matt foley motivational speeches than serious attempts to lay out what an obama presidency would mean to our nation
1904538 what david is basically doing and this is somewhat new for democrats isnt trying to figure out how to sell policies its a matter of personality how do we sell leadership
1904539 although every member of pms staff was profoundly anti hitler the staff was divided into two cliques the liberals who regarded the soviet union as a slave state devoid of individual rights and the liberals who regarded the soviet union as a living demonstration of a truly humane society

1904542 i havent talked to yonder in about a week or so but i know hes got a figure in his mind and i know theyre a long way aways from that figure
1904543 if it doesnt work out i think we could fit him in our lineup
1904544 its going to come down to the deadline of august 15th
1904545 if theyve talked to yonder in the last day or two im not sure whats happened hes got different alternatives he can sign he can come back to school or go to that northern league like j d drew did a good decision would be to come back to school
1904546 a guy like that coming back would be a big boost for anybody he was arguably the best hitter in college baseball
1904547 guys have signed at 11 59 p m on that last day so i try not to get my hopes up too much because so many things happen on that last day
1904548 i dont know how many of the first rounders who have not signed yet but im sure theyre will be some that sign at the last minute

1904585 the idea of turning one billion people into consumers is terrifying
1904586 there are valid concerns that in a country like india where female foeticide is a real problem any further relaxation of abortion laws could be misused however that argument must not hold reasonable reforms to the mtp act to ransom there is a separate law the pre natal diagnostic tests act to address the issue of female foeticide its enforcement is poor government would do well to get its act together in that area
1904587 ethicists social scientists lawmakers and medical specialists should discuss such issues on a common platform until a consensus is reached a new and liberal abortion law is urgently required but we need to be careful as it may be abused to perform female foeticide the medical profession in the past has refused to accept collective responsibility for this genocide and has a poor record in ensuring ethical conduct of doctors it does not have any credibility and has failed to self regulate all future laws must be transparent and have built in checks and mechanisms to curb female foeticide while accommodating late abortions of grossly abnormal foetuses
1904588 it the current law allows termination of the pregnancy even beyond the 20th week if there is a threat to the mothers life however it does not extend that provision to cases where the childs health after birth might be under adverse risk it was this lacuna that the mehtas were challenging as their unborn child runs the risk of being born with congenital heart ailments

1904840 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
1904841 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
1904842 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
1904843 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
1904844 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
1904845 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
1904846 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
1904847 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
1904848 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
1904849 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
1904850 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
1904851 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
1904852 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
1904853 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
1904854 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
1904855 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
1904856 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
1904857 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
1904858 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
1904859 with a military that has become a laughing stock and her increasing irrelevance in the world around her i believe that the canada i know and loved is gone

1904868 weeks back you posted a recipe and picture of a 3 bean salad as i sat reading the post my hubby came into the room and was glowing at your photograph i havent seen my husband this excited over anything in nearly 2 years now my husband is a watercolorist but also a cancer patient he was diagnosed 18 months ago he was a very sick man we both feel a large part of our lives were lost due to his illness at least life as we knew it
1904869 well my husbands excitement over your 3 bean salad picture gave me an idea i printed it out and gave it to him with the hopes that he would run with it and begin painting again one day he asked me to take him up the coast to an area where he always enjoyed the landscape and plein aire painting i said id return in a few hours to pick him up
1904870 you can imagine my surprise when i returned to see an easel of 3 watercolors of not our glorious ocean nor lighthouse but instead 3 paintings of various form and shape of veggies not just any veggies maryanns 3 bean salad veggies lol
1904871 my husband was so proud of his days accomplishment you see my friend your dish moved him in some way to begin painting again its the first thing he has painted in nearly 2 years and we wanted you to have it
1904872 i should also add maryann my husband was a noted landscape artist in new england for the past 25 years with awards and ribbons as long as your arm so this little painting as primitive as it is shows us that somewhere in his mind there still remains that spark of hope he will once again paint painting maryanns veggies was a real milestone for him and we greatly thank you for inspiring him whoever said food blogs are just recipe sites

1904920 understanding and minimizing quality deterioration is critical for manufacturers as it is a key driver of owner satisfaction and word of mouth recommendations
1904921 it is imperative that manufacturers design models that not only achieve high levels of initial quality but also attain high levels of longer term dependability vehicle models that stand the test of time will help automaker profitability through superior owner satisfaction and recommendation rates
1904922 although automakers have achieved tremendous gains in initial quality and dependability in recent years by specifically addressing customer concerns these particular problems still prove challenging for manufacturers
1904923 the fact that these problems have endured throughout the industry for many years suggests that additional focus on these issues prior to vehicle launch would benefit not only consumers but also automakers through increased customer satisfaction
1904924 the gains in dependability for compact and midsize vehicles are good news for consumers who are downsizing their vehicles due to increasing fuel prices
1904925 consumers who purchase these smaller vehicles benefit not only from immediate gains in fuel economy but also from improvements in long term dependability compared with previous years

1904952 we here at fort wayne hip hop dance have been in business since may 2006 and have been growing ever since
1904953 here at our studio we teach the foundational styles of hip hop dance poppin breakin and lockin
1904954 we want our students to be able to express themselves freely with no boundaries
1904955 to be able to step outside the box and create within the style
1904956 we bend over backwards to make sure our students are enjoying what they are doing and learning the culture of hip hop the right way
1904957 its important to us that they know where their dance came from and why who invented these styles etc
1904958 all you need is rhythm and if you dont have that we do have special classes for those who are seeking some
1904959 we eat breathe sleep and live hip hop its our culture and we want it to stay alive the only ones who can preserve it are the ones involved in the actual culture
1904960 i am proud to say that our students are able to free style they know how to express themselves freely and thats real we dont have recitals like most dance studios we have performances that go on throughout the year for students that want to perform
1904961 we dont feel like its right to put a child on stage if they dont want to you see we dont just teach here we are also a performing studio as well we give our students experience throughout the year on how to perform and real showmanship

1904984 the ability to accomplish the prescribed actions in a course of study
1904985 steve jobs has missed the call on making the iphone his first step towards greening apples products
1904986 it seems that apple is far from leading the way for a green electronics industry as
1904987 there is no reason to have these potentially hazardous chemicals in iphones
1904988 we expect apple to reformulate their products to make them safer from cradle to grave so they dont pose a threat to consumers workers or the environment
1904989 can act as a significant source of toxic and persistent brominated pollutants once the iphone headset enters the waste stream
1904990 two of the phthalates plasticers found at high levels in the headphone cable are classified in europe as toxic to reproduction category 2 because of their long recognized ability to interfere with sexual development in mammals
1904991 while they are not prohibited in mobile phones these phthalates are banned from use in all toys or childcare articles sold in europe apple should eliminate the use of these chemicals from its product range
1904992 today weve successfully eliminated the largest applications of pvc and bfrs in our products and were closer to eliminating these chemicals altogether
1904993 for example more than three million ipods have already shipped with bfr free laminate on their logic boards apple plans to completely eliminate the use of pvc and bfrs in its products by the end of 2008
1904994 so what that is saying is that the burden of dibutyl phthalate were already carrying around is causing problems for our sons
1904995 we want to reduce our exposure to this chemical we dont need this in iphone cables and the point is to reduce our exposure to a chemical that has this kind of effects on the next generation
1904996 we believe they should be complying with the law and warning consumers
1904997 but what we hope is that instead of just warning consumers they will actually remove the toxic chemicals from the product
1904998 we have not done any additional analysis but we are definitely investigating it
1904999 its like a rambo movie there are bad guys and if we get rid of them well be safe
1905000 the more complicated truth is that there are a lot of toxic substances floating around out there that we get exposed to people studying actual indoor exposures are a lot more concerned about formaldehydes from cleaning products than the mercury inside of a computer
1905001 the logic that a is toxic and b contains a thus b is toxic doesnt work
1905002 i dont know why greenpeace has chosen to pick on this particular product
1905003 but are the dosages people get in practice enough to worry about i dont have a complete answer in fact no one does but both of these compounds are used in all kinds of household products from upholstery to casings on all kinds of electronics to food wrapping
1905004 its not clear at all why we should get worked up in particular about a relatively small amount in an iphone
1905005 theres hundreds to thousands times more lead in a television tube than an iphone
1905006 my colleagues works on indoor air pollution suggest that aldehydes from cleaning products are probably a far greater problem
1905007 bfrs may indeed be a problem but id start with examining the bfr content in upholstery and other electronics before singling out the iphone
1905008 an opportunity for us to understand more about what our customers need and expect in home installation and technology services within a specific market

1905010 im sure that life is really really great when its all about sex but life is also really really great when its not about sex
1905011 i really had no real interest or desire for sex it was certainly nothing that i would ever think to do
1905012 we did other things wed watch out for each other we were affectionate with each other
1905013 i dont really see any difference between our relationship and other peoples relationships except you know we dont have sex
1905014 i realized that i was asexual because when i was young all of my friends started being attracted to people and i had no idea what they were talking about
1905015 i thought i was the only one in the world i had just kind of settled into the rut that i was different and decided to do the best i could with it
1905016 the youth of today is ever the people of tomorrow for this reason we have set before ourselves the task of inoculating our youth with the spirit of this community of the people at a very early age at an age when human beings are still unperverted and therefore unspoiled this reich stands and it is building itself up for the future upon its youth and this new reich will give its youth to no one but will itself take youth and give to youth its own education and its own upbringing

1905021 styles change quickly so for fashion buyers it is particularly important to go from product discovery to retail shelves in the shortest time possible all the while ensuring quality
1905022 private sourcing events are an ideal solution because they connect buyers with pre screened suppliers in one day at a single location and since meetings take place privately between one buyer and one supplier the format facilitates in depth discussions and negotiations
1905023 we need to continuously update each of our product lines to do that we need to constantly look for new quality suppliers with new designs private sourcing events help us do that by delivering pre screened suppliers capable of meeting our high quality standards with competitive pricing
1905024 private sourcing events maximize the exposure we get to buyers through global sources website trade shows and magazines while online and print are great for lead generation and branding face to face events like these give us the chance to go straight to negotiations and closing orders

1905033 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
1905034 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief
1905035 this study adds to a growing body of evidence that indicates that cannabis is effective in the short term at least in the management of neuropathic pain

1905127 let me remind you that there are a lot of good things about being in a relationship for example having someone who is obligated to hang out with you and cheer you up when you have a bad day standing weekend plans action on demand being comfortable enough that you can wear your sweatpants have a bad hair day get sick or even pick your nose in front of them and you know theyre not going to judge you or at least not going to leave you

1905142 i used to feel the most beautiful when id wake up super early in the morning and go down to the lake by my parents house and take off all my clothes and go for a naked swim at sunrise it was a great and liberating way to start the day i dont live by the lake any more so i have substituted naked cleaning when my roommates arent around for naked swimming its great to move around and not feel self conscious about my body and the feeling carries over even when i put my clothes back on try it
1905143 knowing that i know how to live richly regardless of money makes me feel more powerful than anything in the world and when i feel powerful i feel beautiful

1905149 what a nice dark space you have created it really brings out your images
1905150 our belief is that particularly for this tween market theres a little bit of undiscovered opportunity within sears
1905151 part of what sears needs to do is build credibility with this tween market there are a lot of people out there that have that credibility so weve partnered with them to help us do that
1905152 its definitely a much bigger element of our back to school program than last year
1905153 and digital continues to grow as an element of our marketing program across our company we invest heavily in search digital and other programs
1905154 its emblematic and important because sears is a relatively traditional marketer in some ways and this is a really impressive innovative program that is using all of the coolest things that web 2 0 has to offer
1905155 obviously back to school is when we put a focus on this market
1905156 it may be related to the loss of social and instrumental support in the form of care and help with daily activities such as help in cooking cleaning and shopping formerly shared with the deceased spouse
1905157 second grief and spousal loss may cause various symptoms such as depression and anxiety loss of appetite sleep disturbances fatigue and loss of concentration that could increase the need for institutional care
1905158 the data were unique in that they covered a large number of persons bereaved during the follow up and gave the dates of bereavement and of first admission into institutional care
1905159 the excess risk of institutionalization was highest during the first month after the spouses death more than three times higher among both men and women and decreased with time from bereavement stabilizing at approximately 20 to 50 higher over 1 to 5 years
1905160 should be targeted to the bereaved immediately after a spouses death to reduce the need for institutional care
1905161 you never stop lovin somebody you just start loving somebody else
1905162 if you aint got nothing nice to say dont say anything at all
1905163 after a while you start noticing people wearing a lapel pin but not acting very patriotic not voting to provide veterans with resources that they need not voting to make sure that disability payments were coming out on time my attitude is that im less concerned about what youre wearing on your lapel than whats in your heart
1905164 anytime that you pledge allegiance you put your hand over your heart and i always have and i always will its simply not true
1905165 and yet at certain times over the last sixteen months i have found for the first time my patriotism challenged at times as a result of my own carelessness more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears about who i am and what i stand for
1905166 we can arrive at a definition of patriotism that however rough and imperfect captures the best of americas common spirit
1905167 i came to understand that our revolution was waged for the sake of that belief that we could have the right to pursue our individual dreams but the obligation to help our fellow citizens pursue theirs
1905168 i also believe that patriotism must if it is to mean anything involve the willingness to sacrifice to give up something we value on behalf of a larger cause
1905169 we must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform the sacrifice of our troops is always worthy of honor even for those not in the military the call to sacrifice for the countrys greater good remains an imperative of citizenship
1905170 i believe one of the tasks of the next administration is to ensure that this movement towards service grows and sustains itself in the years to come we should expand americorps and grow the peace corps we should encourage national service by making it part of the requirement for a new college assistance program
1905171 just as patriotism involves each of us making a commitment to this nation that extends beyond our own immediate self interest so must that commitment extends beyond our own time here on earth
1905172 patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it
1905173 the basic outline of the government we possess and our civic religion as a people is such that potentially at least we could create a society that is a model for the world it isnt right now
1905174 be joyful always pray continually and give thanks in all circumstances

1905197 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
1905198 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
1905199 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
1905200 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
1905201 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
1905202 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
1905203 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
1905204 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
1905205 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
1905206 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
1905207 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
1905208 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
1905209 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
1905210 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
1905211 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
1905212 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
1905213 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
1905214 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
1905215 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
1905216 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
1905217 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
1905218 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
1905219 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
1905220 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
1905221 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
1905222 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
1905223 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
1905224 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
1905225 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
1905226 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

1905228 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
1905229 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
1905230 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone

1905232 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
1905233 electra leah wants to know and i do too how is it physically possible for a male vampire to get someone pregnant this question directly responds to being told that vampires cant have babies when you were first asked the question did you not think that it specifically applied to bella and edwards ability to have children together
1905234 s there were several questions along this line as you might imagine i picked this one specifically because i want you to imagine for the last year me going online and reading all of these stephenie said this quote quote that i never said um there was quite a bit of mis quoting going on and i was always always very careful about how i answered this question because of course i knew renesme was on the way and i didnt want to spoil that and take away some of the excitement of something new happening so i tried to avoid that as much as possible but when i did i always focused on female vampires because physiologically speaking theres a lot of change that goes on when youre pregnant with a child that couldnt happen so when i answered that question that was all i ever really commented on it is physically possible sic for males vampires i dont want to go into it in too much detail i think whats going to happen its a whole long thing im guessing i think its going to have to show up somewhere in like the twilight saga guide thats going to come out later
1905235 everybodys worried whats wrong man why are you acting like this
1905236 i know you dont really want to do this just talk to me tell me whats wrong
1905237 if you keep this up youll force me to escape and regroup with a team thats going to have to take your wild ass down do not continue this
1905238 yeah markos intense but this is serious maybe supersid was right maybe we do have to take marko down
1905239 take my older brother down ive been waiting for this
1905240 he is my older brother stealing the spotlight and shit
1905241 dont you understand our latest threat is a man we respect a man we love and apparently a man we have taken for granted and youre thrilled about this
1905242 i dont think it matters anymore i remember a long time ago we were in high school part of team ultimate and marko warned us of his dark side telling us that it was bound to show up he said that we should be very well prepared to take him out and we were yes marko man is possibly the greatest hero ever but we have to do what has to be done the fact is this if we can take him out then its not that we dont need him but it means that whatever threat shows up well be able to take care of it because we took down marko man and that will always mean something you know what i mean
1905243 we take marko down if it comes down to it then we will take him out
1905244 what the fuck im here trying to take over nessasis and youre busy destroying it i cant rule what doesnt exist you have to stop immediately or ill stop you myself
1905245 however should you continue to do what you are doing you give us no choice but to fight you take you down and if it comes to it take you out we already know that if it goes in that direction that you will not hesitate to try and hurt us and were over that we know that chances are with you being you that you will get in your hits give us one hell of a battle and possibly hurt us and were over that we are fully prepared to fight you and do what has to be done for nessasis
1905246 do you want to accept our offer and talk to us or what

1905248 what acting offered me was the chance to be many other people in those days i wasnt satisfied with being me

1905257 kijk eens naar dat slecht opgevoede jongetje hij zit op de ezel terwijl zijn arme ouders die al oud zijn de ezel moeten trekken
1905258 wij kunnen niet toelaten dat de mensen zo slecht spreken over onze zoon
1905259 kijk naar die schaamteloze kerel hij laat het jongetje en de arme vrouw de ezel trekken terwijl hij op zijn gemakje op de rug van de ezel zit
1905260 arme man nadat hij een hele dag gewerkt heeft zit zijn vrouw op de ezel en het arme kind wie weet wat hem nog te wachten staat met zo een moeder

1905268 what do you think about our next child coming from ethiopia
1905269 clearly we like taking on big projects like world hunger and ridiculous endurance races
1905270 although im unlikely to set any records on the ironman wisconsin course were hoping to win the janus charity challenge at this years ironman nonetheless im thrilled that ironman has this second kind of competition going to compete for a 10 000 00 donation to a great cause makes the experience far more meaningful
1905271 for a bit less than most endurance athletes pay for a canister of electrolyte replacement powder
1905272 we can prevent a kids dying from lack of nutrition
1905273 babies are put on scales in feeding centers to determine which among the malnourished is closest enough to death to
1905274 plumpy nut is impressive because it has a long shelf life doesnt need to be mixed with water can be given to kids at home by their mothers and is incredibly cost effective 40 worth of treatment turns a childs health around and the best part is the children stay at home with their families while regaining their stamina and health
1905275 women are walking overnight carrying their severely ill children endless hours to get to a doctors without borders feeding station to pick up a weeks supply of plumpy nut turn around and carry it and the child home
1905276 ironman is a long trip but its one we have a privilege of choosing to take and doesnt have these kinds of stakes
1905277 the world is a smaller place than we often believe
1905278 and we are all connected the world my family and i are creating for ezkeiel is one in which those connections and our sense of responsibility for each others welfare are a part of daily life our building this fund for doctors without borders and our effort to win the 10 000 donation for them through ambers ironman charity challenge effort is part of that commitment to making his world a better one people have been donating from across the country and the sense of people working together to make a great impact on a solvable human problem is inspiring
1905279 i think of those women carrying their children in their arms across difficult terrain no spectators no water stations no medics on the course to assist them and no choice but to move forward and i keep going we are their aid station
1905280 im looking forward to seeing meghan holding ezkeiel at the ironman finish line september 7 as a reminder of how our worlds are connected in amazing ways even when were all on our own journeys
1905281 what do you think about our next child coming from ethiopia
1905282 if reforming us health care results only in expanded access to care costs will increase faster but with limited health benefits if only cost controls are instituted even more individuals will be denied access to needed care health care must be restructured to make maximizing health the organizing principle
1905283 hey dave cori here this is not an emergency so yeah i wanted to warn you that i went ahead and tried to help out nice kitty with the matted hair situation and well i think i butchered her she looks quite pathetic though she seems in good spirits and was very happy to have the matts removed anyways i am sorry for making your cat ugly and well i think i cut a little too close a couple times too so yeah i thought i should warn you before you saw her hope youre having a good camping trip bye
1905284 i saw a dark silhouette at the table i tried to talk but i was unable she drew me in right under her spell i was hypnotized by the sudden temptation of that woman in black shes a mystery shes everything a woman should be woman in black shes got a hold on me shes in control she wont set me free

1905300 ive tried to make the record something different from the show that was on the royal opera house

1905309 where should the story go now based on what we know we need to achieve
1905310 youre holding 50 other boring brochures in your hand right now
1905311 youre stressing out not sure whether to listen to your parents counselors teachers or heaven forbid your own gut instinct
1905312 it is vice presidential season where every picture looks like a campaign brochure and introductions sound like tryouts few know whats going on and everybody gets asked about it
1905313 well im not looking to be vp but im sure i wouldnt turn it down
1905314 last week it swirled around virginia gov tim kaine a devout roman catholic and a moderate democrat who might help pull his southern state into the democratic column
1905315 hundreds of miles to the west in elkhart indiana sen evan bayh and sen obama were looking chummy co campaigning and there was an obama ad team crew shooting video of bayh at the event
1905316 bayh is a midwest moderate and a platinum name in indiana a republican stronghold but obama might be able to change the pattern of history and shake up electoral college calculations if he put an indianan on the ticket
1905317 it could be either bayh or kaine or neither of them
1905318 also in play former policy power player and delaware sen joe biden and the well credentialed governor of new mexico bill richardson
1905319 they are all like that these vice presidential maybes skirting flirting trying not to seem eager while still being available

1905327 dont let your man see my eyes i wont be able to help it but ill steal him
1905328 ambasada romana din moldova este intruchiparea perfecta a securitatii ceausiste de peste granite acolo unde trebuiau cautati disidentii anticeausisti care trebuiau impuscati
1905329 eu ca fost agent de spionaj extern pentru romania am fost constient ca mi a fost verificata loialitatea si confirmata anual de minimum cinci agenti de legatura din moldova localnici de un rus care actioneaza in moldova pentru spionajul romanesc si de alti doi agenti romani care sunt naturalizati in moldova la randu mi am avut obligatia profesionala sa verific loialitatea fata de romania a subiectilor lorena bogza victor nichitus cristian pohrib dan dungaciu iurie rosca val butnaru vasile butnaru nicolae negru constantin tanase nicolae dabija grigore vieru alexandru si ana bantos aurel scobioala si inca 35 de subiecti asupra carora voi reveni
1905330 serviciile secrete romanesti care actioneaza in moldova cele de la linie dezinformeaza conducerea romaniei cu privire la adevarata stare de spirit din moldova spala uriase sume de bani prin intermediul publicatiilor sponsorizarilor de carte bonuri de consum curent la restaurant sau receptii chitante de mana pentru recompensarea unor informatii furnizate de catre subiectii moldoveni cumparari de cadouri pentru aceiasi subiecti prime etc
1905331 e un comportament absolut inadmisibil din partea romaniei si in cazuri din astea multe tari recurg chiar la ruperea relatiilor diplomatice se vede foarte clar ca acest stat nu recunoaste tara noastra
1905332 cel mai dramatic este ca ambasadorul filip teodorescu si a permis sa atace prevederile tratatului de pace din 1947 in care au fost fixate frontierele dintre fosta urss si romania
1905333 noi acum intelegem de ce pe parcursul a 16 ani romania nu a dorit semnarea cu republica moldova a tratatului politic de baza si a tratatului de frontiera pentru ca nu recunoaste rezultatele celui de al doilea razboi mondial si acum acest lucru a iesit la suprafata
1905334 s au ocupat cu activitate politica indreptata impotriva suveranitatii si independentei republicii moldova
1905335 este evident de ce a fost expulzat anume atasatul pentru cultura romania nu ar trebui sa se ocupe de sustinerea ziarelor care constituie baza partidelor politice din republica moldova toate ziarele pe care le sustine romania promoveaza concepte politice inclusiv cele pentru copii sau adolescenti
1905336 chiar si in parlament sint o buna parte din deputati care nu vorbesc despre interesele republicii moldova ci mai mult de interesele romaniei uitati va cum promoveaza unii politicieni ideea de denumire a tarii ei o numesc basarabia si nu republica moldova asta i lipsa de respect fata de stat de fapt este contestarea statului si poporului
1905337 trebuie sa expulzam si noi doi diplomati moldoveni nu e cazul sa facem concesii inutile in rest insa e bine sa avem o reactie matura nu neaparat in zona publica ci cu instrumentele normale diplomatice de care dispunem pentru a evita escaladarea si repetarea episodului din martie 2002
1905338 give me love give me love give me peace on earth
1905339 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
1905340 it was a horrible horrible decision that we still dwell on
1905341 but i dont think the doors closed obviously right now were tied up with apb and everything else but hopefully in the future well have the resource and something can be worked out with microsoft
1905342 we still do not have an in depth understanding of the war fighting doctrine laid down by muhammad how it might be applied today by an increasing number of islamic groups or how it might be countered
1905343 though there are today many middle east studies departments one will be sorely pressed to find any courses dealing with the most pivotal and relevant topics of today such as islamic jurisprudence and what it has to say about jihad or the concept of abode of islam versus the abode of war
1905344 the would be student will be inundated with courses dealing with the evils of orientalism and colonialism
1905345 a world wide positive intention experiment will be conducted at 8 pm universal time 08 08 08 to put an end to secret agreements that have prevented the revolutionary technology and knowledge of extraterrestrial life entering mainstream society a galactic freedom day declaration has been issued by cooperating citizen organizations clearly expressing humanitys intent to put an end to secret agreements concerning extraterrestrial life
1905346 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
1905347 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
1905348 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
1905349 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
1905350 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
1905351 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
1905352 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
1905353 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
1905354 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
1905355 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
1905356 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
1905357 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
1905358 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
1905359 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
1905360 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
1905361 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
1905362 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
1905363 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
1905364 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
1905365 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
1905366 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
1905367 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
1905368 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
1905369 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
1905370 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
1905371 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
1905372 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
1905373 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
1905374 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
1905375 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
1905376 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
1905377 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
1905378 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
1905379 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
1905380 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
1905381 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
1905382 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
1905383 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
1905384 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
1905385 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
1905386 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
1905387 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
1905388 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
1905389 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
1905390 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
1905391 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
1905392 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed
1905393 when our sons and daughters put their lives on the line
1905394 what do you think about our next child coming from ethiopia
1905395 my boyfriend says that its ok that i have a crush on hellboy
1905396 birds of a feather flock together if youre an eagle dont hang around chickens
1905397 we acknowledge as part of our assessment that there is an increase because of biofuel production because of feed prices on certain industries
1905398 however is that the result of the ethanol mandate our answer is no
1905399 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
1905400 volgens robert wil rtl 5 pas in 2009 door op tv
1905401 ik wilde even kort met mijn lieve kijkers praten want er is zoveel gepraat over het feit dat jensen niet door zou gaan het zou gecancelled zijn en dat soort dingen ik wil toch even een reactie geven en dan maar gewoon op internet je kan wel met 100 000 journalisten praten maar het komt er toch niet goed uit het echte verhaal doe ik hier
1905402 gripping story of suspicion cast on a priests behavior that is less about scandal than about fascinatingly nuanced questions of moral certainty
1905403 give me love give me love give me peace on earth
1905404 we were tired of seeing the candidates tip toe around the issues and merely pay lip service so we created this questionnaire posing specific policy questions for the candidates to answer
1905405 the first phone call i placed was answered cordially i was told that someone would get back to me i never heard back from anyone

1905427 then if anyone tells you look here is the messiah or there he is dont believe it for false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform great signs and wonders so as to deceive if possible even gods chosen ones see i have warned you about this ahead of time

1905432 the federal reserve always promises that its working to bring down inflation but as the case against the fed it never does since the fed came into being the dollars value has plummeted to less than a penny and even at a 3 inflation rate prices will tend to double every 25 years the fed wants to cover its crimes by appearing more successful at battling inflation what the fed doesnt want to talk about is the real cause of inflation not greedy consumers avaricious workers or price gouging corporations but the central bank itself and its power and practice of creating money out of thin air

1905436 the document of right guidance for jihad activity in egypt and the world
1905437 is not to kill civilians foreigners and tourists destroy property and commit aggression against the lives and property of those who are inviolable under the pretext of jihad all of this is forbidden

1905439 allah does not accept martyrdom as atonement for a mujahids debts
1905440 it is not permitted to go out to fight jihad without the permission of both parents because acting rightly with ones parents is an individual obligation and they have rights over their sons
1905441 we find parents who only learn that their son has gone to fight jihad after his picture is published in the newspapers as a fatality or a prisoner

1905464 the pill works by preventing your body from absorbing some of the fat you eat
1905465 and who wants to live like that with alli you have an option based on gradual and healthy progress
1905466 why set nutritional and diet goals and why make a commitment to go to the gym when you could take a pill
1905467 alli prevents your body from absorbing about a quarter of the fat you eat so if you eat a reduced calorie low fat diet and use alli capsules you can make a real difference in your weight as you limit the total number of calories that enter your system
1905468 active ingredient orlistat inactive ingredients fd amp c blue no 2 edible ink gelatin iron oxide microcrystalline cellulose povidone sodium lauryl sulfate sodium starch glycolate talc titanium dioxide
1905469 a product that is intended to supplement the diet and bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients mineral intended for ingestion in pill capsule tablet powder or liquid form
1905470 alli capsules work by preventing the absorption of some of the fat you eat the fat passes out of your body so you may have bowel changes you may get gas with oily spotting loose stools more frequent stools that may be hard to control
1905471 certain side effects due to the pill theyre again leaning on the ignorance of the overweight population it should have been stated more like
1905472 alli capsules work by preventing the absorption of some of the fat you eat when you overconsume fat or when you are taking a product that blocks the absorption of fat your body needs to eliminate the excess this elimination takes place through your bowels you will most likely experience gas with oily spotting loose stools and more frequent stools that may be hard to control however the effects of alli will be different on each individual and therefore the severity of the side effects will vary based upon each person
1905473 diet and exercise are the starting points for any weight loss program try these first before adding alli check with your doctor before starting any exercise program
1905474 whats so hard about taking a pill and following a plan if youve ever tried to lose weight before you know the hurdles weve all heard the same thing for years eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise are the starting points for any weight loss program
1905475 the excess fat is not harmful in fact you may recognize it in the toilet as something that looks like the oil on top of pizza
1905476 you may feel an urgent need to go to the bathroom until you have a sense of any treatment effects its probably a smart idea to wear dark pants and bring a change of clothes with you to work
1905477 you may not usually get gassy but its a possibility when you take alli the bathroom is really the best place to go when that happens
1905478 you can use a food journal to recognize what foods can lead to treatment effects for example writing down what you eat may help you to learn that marinara sauce is a better option than alfredo sauce
1905479 i probably should really start cooking healthier maybe not use so much oil i should probably avoid fast food for awhile and sweets and regular soda maybe eat more vegetables

1905559 maternity and rape crisis intervention services are vital to many of brooklyns residents and families we can not stand idly by while lich takes these important services away from the community while failing to present a long term plan for its financial stability
1905560 our neighborhoods of brooklyn heights boerum hill cobble hill and dumbo have become home to many young families with young children with the potential of many more children on the way it would be a tragedy for lich to close their ob gyn and pediatric departments when these families most need these services i wholeheartedly support my community and the doctors and other hospital personnel in this fight to stop the dismantling of this important medical facility by continuum health care i have already contacted the new york state department of health to let them know how concerned i am about the proposed termination of these services at lich

1905628 the good thing about the heightened awareness now is that at least some of these soldiers names are getting out there

1905630 unless this reality is understood and action is taken promptly the future of afghanistan is bleak
1905631 its like people forget about us being in afghanistan larry would tell me that all the time

1905634 he loved the farm and he loved the cows and hed come home from leave and go out in the barn and take a deep breath and say oh that smells good
1905635 we were thankful that he died at the hands of his own men that he loved and not at the hands of those who hated him and hated all americans

1905647 as a father it angers me some it angered me when he was there especially since iraq gets all the attention iraq gets all the money
1905648 it is my sense that it is a pivotal time in this thing
1905649 i think its a valid war but because it doesnt get the attention it doesnt get all it needs consequently i think the guerrilla war will be going for a long time

1905886 adam craig usa cycling ive never had any experience even remotely close to what i had in beijing last fall betty ann bowser last september he was in the chinese capital to compete in a series of pre olympic warm up races adam craig its like its a weird bronchial spasm thing that i was getting that just like whenever you tried to take enough breath to give your muscles that fuel of oxygen they need your bronchioles just start spasming and you just like physically cant do it and its like akin to drowning or something just not being able to take that full breath and you know having your body really require that oxygen and not being able to get it is a pretty unique and pretty terrifying situation i think betty ann bowser just 30 minutes after the starting gun of the race craig had to quit but he had lots of world class company adam craig the current world champion and the current olympic champion julien absalon same deal about the same point in the race 20 or 30 minutes in actually was sick to his stomach and threw up and was hacking and wheezing and had to pull out and yes i think there were 46 starters and eight finishers so thats a pretty high attrition rate for a two hour mountain bike race around a fairly easy course

1905924 creation has set for us an example that we should follow now a good deal of christendom is of the mind that jesus died so that we should not have to if that is the case then paul and all the church missed the point entirely those of that era followed christ no they shamelessly ran after him in such a way and with such intensity that we are often embarrassed today by our lack of desire in comparison our lack of intensity our lack of urgency about him they died we live they bled we do all in our power to keep from it they gave themselves we save ourselves they lived a crucified life we speak of it they overcame we undergo they laid their lives down freely as if it were their privilege we clutch ours to ourselves and if we should perchance die anyway our lives must be virtually wrenched from us they suffered joyfully the spoiling of their goods god help any who even think of defrauding us today they lived as those who were not of this world we speak as those who are not of this world but just try withholding any part of this world from us and we have a fit rather we want to impose our standards upon a blind world so that their entertainment is tame enough to suit our tastes we have an unerring tendency to speak high and live low

1905974 my first four years in the army i was in a couple of mos that were phased out
1905975 i decided that i didnt want to go through that again i picked up a copy of soldiers magazine and i read an article about mortuary affairs guys going to vietnam looking for missing soldiers from that war i decided that was what i wanted to do
1905976 you have to have a good mindset because you go to the medical examiners office in richmond va on day two of training they subject you to human remains if you come back from that trip and decide you cant handle it you get re classed into a different mos we usually lose a couple of people per cycle but those who do stay in our field stay for the long haul very few people ets its a very self satisfying job because when you ship a soldier home you know youve done your best to send them home with all honors it gets you in the heart to know youve done your best for a soldier who has given his all for his country
1905977 we inventory everything the soldier had on them and we process them and prepare them for transport

1906000 love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other
1906001 love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your french fries without making them give you any of theirs
1906002 love is when you kiss all the time then when you get tired of kissing you still want to be together and you talk more my mommy and daddy are like that they look gross when they kiss
1906003 there are two kinds of love our love gods love but god makes both kinds of them
1906004 love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well

1906028 this is going to be my most interesting breakfast ever
1906029 sales have been steady for the past four months and have not dropped off as they usually do in july
1906030 weve been saying all along this year that our sales are actually reasonably strong
1906031 i think that we still have some people thinking that their properties are still worth what they would have been worth a year ago and were getting to the point that sellers are realizing that my property might not be worth what i thought it was
1906032 still relatively stable without any evidence of dramatic up or down swings
1906033 i think in a lot of canadian markets theyre just starting to experience their correction where we went through ours last year
1906034 we needed to send 600 mayors to iraq to get that country functioning again
1906035 whatever the outcome of the united states presidential election climate change policy will be transformed republican john mccain believes it presents a test of foresight of political courage and of the unselfish concern that one generation owes to the next while democrat barack obama calls it one of the greatest moral challenges of our generation recently the copenhagen consensus project gathered eight of the worlds top economists to examine research on the best ways to tackle 10 global challenges air pollution conflict disease global warming hunger and malnutrition lack of education gender inequity lack of water and sanitation terrorism and trade barriers their goal was to create a prioritized list showing how money could best be spent combating these problems the panel concluded that the least effective use of resources would come from simply cutting carbon dioxide emissions the expert panel concluded that investing in research and development into low carbon energy would be a much sounder more effective option an effort that both mccain and obama support but this not carbon emissions should be the core of their climate change policy currently low carbon energy solutions are prohibitively expensive the typical cost of cutting a ton of carbon dioxide is now about 20 but the damage from a ton of carbon in the atmosphere is about 2 so we need to reduce by roughly 10 fold the cost of cutting emissions we can achieve this by spending dramatically more researching and developing low carbon energy the us could provide leadership by committing to spending 0 05 percent of its gdp exploring non carbon emitting energy technologies wind wave or solar power or capturing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants it would then have the moral authority to demand that other nations do the same
1906036 typically at the end of a market cycle you will see home prices remain flat or even come off a few percentage points a year until the next cycle begins
1906037 barring a complete deterioration in the provincial economy and mortgage interest rates climbing rapidly thats kind of what we see in terms of what market activity is showing us
1906038 were seeing more price reductions in properties listed on the market which is a levelling impact on the housing price increases experienced at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2008
1906039 buyers are now in the drivers seat in the fraser valley and were starting to see that reflected in home prices
1906040 theres not a lot of economic news out there right now that is going to bolster demand in a significant way that well see sales levels return to what they were
1906041 there is only so long that a market can continue on price increases
1906042 after youve gone three years with double digit price increases and even if the economy is moving along and interest rates remain low there is this sort of market exhaustion
1906043 its not like there is any remaining great well of growth
1906044 in essence canadas housing market has pulled back from the record setting pace of 2007 but in most provinces it continues at or near sales levels set in the years before that
1906045 the increase in housing prices is also pulling back from the record setting pace of last year but we have yet to see any of the price contractions that have impacted the housing market in the united states
1906046 resale housing activity is cooling evenly in rural suburban and urban markets
1906047 there is no statistical evidence to date that shows increases in energy prices are prompting canadians to relocate
1906048 in ignorance a certain knowledge and knowledge undispensed its own undoing
1906049 they couldnt seem to get excited about what they or the clients were doing and if you cant get passionate about something you shouldnt be doing it
1906050 look no further than the crude oil market for a case study in price volatility and rapidly changing investor sentiment one month ago in the face of 147 crude oil the bulls were stampeding and brazenly promoting price targets of 200 250 or more
1906051 politicians were assailing the dreaded speculator likely because its easier to blame a fictional villain than look in the mirror and accept responsibility for contributing to an inept or arguably non existent national energy policy
1906052 yet that was then and this is now now after a rapid 16 decline from the peak on july 11 the oil bulls have vanished into the fbis witness protection program
1906053 the bears are on the prowl talking about demand destruction resulting from a weakening global economy fewer miles driven by american motorists and a rumored armada of oil tankers steaming to our shores from saudi arabia to save the day the oil bubble has burst
1906054 was it a bubble when investor sentiment swings like a pendulum as quickly as it does in this environment we find it helpful to check our emotions look at the facts and dust off the old economics textbook and revisit the concept of supply and demand
1906055 the facts suggest that we are addicted to oil and that the rest of the world is becoming addicted too growth in demand for crude oil has accelerated in each of the last three decades
1906056 between 1980 and 1990 according to the energy information administration eia worldwide daily demand grew 5 7 demand growth accelerated to 15 0 between 1990 and 2000 and should accelerate again in this decade with growth of 10 already from 2000 through 2006
1906057 opec estimates that the world will demand 113 million barrels of oil per day in 2030 up more than 33 from 2006
1906058 the driver behind this accelerating demand growth is the industrialization of emerging economies like china india brazil and other far east countries
1906059 china india and other developing coutries currently use substantially less oil per dollar of gdp implying plenty of runway for demand growth as emerging economies develop an industrial base and their populations accumulate wealth and consume more goods and services
1906060 china for example uses less than half the crude oil to generate 1 of gdp than the u s does india uses nearly 60 less oil per 1 of gdp than the u s oil consumption relative to population also points to further demand growth in developing countries
1906061 the bears argue that high oil prices changing habits and a weak u s economy will result in slackening demand and lower oil prices
1906062 while current economic headwinds could batter oil prices and energy stocks around in the short term be mindful of the big picture emerging economies will thirst for even more oil in the future and the ability of supply to keep up is more questionable than ever
1906063 short term weakness in energy will yield again to a crude reality which means a smart investor focused on the big picture can take advantage of energy stocks on sale now at a stock market near you

1906149 if you dream that your teeth are loose there will be failures and gloomy tidings
1906150 if you lose your teeth you will have burdens which will crush your pride and demolish your affairs
1906151 to examine your teeth warns you to be careful of your affairs as enemies are lurking near you if they appear decayed and snaggled your business or health will suffer from intense strains
1906152 to dream of spitting out teeth portends personal sickness or sickness in your immediate family
1906153 for one tooth to fall out foretells disagreeable news if two it denotes unhappy states that the dreamer will be plunged into from no carelessness on his part if three fall out sickness and accidents of a very serious nature will follow
1906154 seeing all the teeth drop out death and famine usually will prevail if the teeth are decayed and you pull them out the same only yourself is prominent in the case
1906155 we are celebrating many things this weekend first and foremost its the 40 year anniversary of the railway being re opened as a branch line in 1968 by volunteers
1906156 also this year marks 20 years since our first diesel gala which was in 1988 and ten years since direct rail services a mainline freight operator from carlisle have been sending locomotives here
1906157 but the oldest of them all is the jolly fisherman which is 100 years old this year
1906158 the train isnt running to skegness today just to oxenhope which is nearly the same
1906159 last year we were approached by the railway for the 40th anniversary
1906160 skegness owns the original plaque with the jolly fisherman logo on and they asked if they could use it for the anniversary they also said they would be delighted if the mayor and a party could come and be involved in the action of the day and it has been absolutely fantastic
1906161 we have been treated with courtesy and everyone has been fantastic
1906162 so while british railways gave the original painting to the sudc in 1966 did the railways have the right to pass on copyright as it may have not been theirs to give in the first place
1906163 thats my stance and the stance the twon council and district coouncil should take

1906191 they are often punctured in apples or bananas when prisoners go to court to the hospital they get hold of them they are also hidden in private parts and in one case we had to take the prisoner to the hospital to take it out i agree that there is connivance at some level as well another problem is that prisons are very large and require many jammers puzhal for instance is 212 acres and the trichy prison 268 acres

1906193 as with any rapidly developing economy the rules and frameworks in which the economy operates sometimes take a while to catch up
1906194 international players at times have operated on the basis of deniability in taking part in this behavior
1906195 the premiere identified areas where there was an over concentration of power together with ineffective supervision as the most vulnerable area subject to corruption
1906196 recently pinpointed industries such as medicine and medical device sales as areas that are open to corruption because abuse of power remains constant in those industries
1906197 i think the premieres comments suggest that there will be increased supervision of company behavior
1906198 with illegal trade practices a bidder can be disqualified for up to one and two years and can have its business license to operate in china revoked
1906199 on top of that there may also be criminal charges

1906207 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
1906208 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
1906209 for the love of god lets try to prevent this from degenerating into yet another rorschach test which is what generally happens when popular culture gets fascinated by an incident they dont know jack shit about
1906210 it is so vital to emphasize that not a shred of evidence has yet been presented that the now deceased bruce ivins played any role in the anthrax attacks let alone that he was the sole or even primary culprit nonetheless just as they did with steven hatfill the media with some notable and important exceptions are reporting this case as though the matter is resolved
1906211 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary he had in his mind that he was omnipotent
1906212 no tests ever found or even suggested the presence of bentonite the claim was just concocted from the start it just never happened
1906213 bruce ivins was troubled by the dust dirt and clutter on his officemates desk and not just because it looked messy he suspected the dust was laced with anthrax
1906214 one researcher described a common room in the lab area as a
1906215 triggered by a technicians fears that she had been exposed
1906216 ivins found evidence of anthrax and decontaminated the womans desk computer keypad and monitor
1906217 the six member team that worked in the lab equipped to handle anthrax had swollen to a staff of 85

1906228 the illinois state police have already done an exceptional job reducing the number of lives lost from traffic crashes
1906229 the use of speed enforcement cameras on interstate highways throughout illinois will mean that even more lives will be saved by targeting motorist that drive at excessively high and reckless speeds at the same time we will try to assist the chicago police department in reducing gun related crimes
1906230 this is not only the right step but also a necessary step to improve public safety in illinois one third of all highway fatalities are attributable to excess speed
1906231 i was proud to sponsor the red light photo enforcement legislation that dramatically reduced fatalities in the areas where it is in use and i look forward to working with the governor and my peers in the general assembly to quickly make this common sense proposal a reality to further reduce fatalities
1906232 as we continue to aggressively seek new ways to enhance public safety the illinois state police welcomes this new approach to encourage motorists to slow down although weve clearly made progress to reduce fatalities i believe we can do better
1906233 photo speed enforcement has been an effective tool in work zones across the state in helping to reduce fatal crashes by implementing this initiative on the interstate systems we will only increase our efforts about the importance of following the posted speed limit on illinois roadways speeding is one of the top contributing factors in crashes on illinois roadways and we are pleased to help drive any effort forward that contributes to saving more lives

1906371 its much easier to charge people more money once youve given them a super bowl
1906372 opening a new stadium with favre as your quarterback is a whole lot different than opening it with chad pennington
1906373 im not always proud of what you see on the show nor is jon but were certainly not going to hide our imperfections the goal is to show the world that this job is hard a lot harder than jon and i ever imagined

1906375 a film crew is in their house three to four days per week
1906376 are paid for their participation but she and tlc officials declined to disclose the fee similarly some perks such as her tummy tuck and jons hair transplant have been provided free of charge
1906377 the show causes powerful emotional reactions with most people people either love it or hate it they comment on the way jon and kate treat each other on the things the children say on every little nuance of each episode this is not a show that people take lightly
1906378 kates behavior has been questionable at times verbally berating her husband and apparently physically slapping him but hes not laying down and just taking it either he gives it back to her and they are often seen having immature bickering exchanges
1906379 but i was surprised that everybody ended up making so much controversy that we were by ourselves because thats not true there were more camera crew and producers than there were kids
1906380 there was only one time i was upset with the producers when we were fixing to kill the chickens and they were telling me to say ugly chickens deserve to die and all that kind of stuff i didnt realize theyd actually make it out on tv to sound that bad but when i did see it i was like whoa thats not how that went i wasnt okay with how they made me look i didnt act like that the whole time sometimes i did but i was 10 when the show was on tv my parents were like taylor did you really do that and i would actually tell them how it went if the producers told me to say that sometimes my friends would help me when people would come up to me and make fun of me and say deal with it or ugly chickens deserve to die its like my friends kind of knew that some of it wasnt real even though i was the bad person it was a once in a lifetime experience so id love to go back it was fun

1906408 i started an appeal of the decision today to reestablish parental authority and to ensure that this case doesnt set a precedent
1906409 parents are going to be walking on egg shells from now on
1906410 i think most children respect their parents and would never go so far as to take them to court but its clear that some would and we have to ask ourselves how far this will go
1906411 he always demanded that female workers signalled to him with their eyes that they desperately wanted to be laid on the boardroom table as soon as he gave the word

1906414 he seemed to jump right in and be fairly comfortable with the speed of play in the ahl and i thought he made smart decisions with the puck he clearly improved his production throughout his college career and if his development continues on that upward curve i think he could be a real solid prospect

1906424 it cannot be that human rights groups care only for people on the wrong side of the law
1906425 and so i want to ask our goodly friends who are using human rights concerns to batter bruce goldings reasonable rational crime plan what about chris human rights what about the rights of those cute babies on the way to the edna manley clinic and those sweet faced children on their way to school do they have to sacrifice their rights because known feared criminals cannot be kept under lock and key while the police research the evidence to bring them to book
1906426 i realize that people who are poorly prepared to discuss this situation on merit will resort to dismissing me as someone sitting in a relatively calm america who wishes to lecture jamaicans about how to solve the crime problem when coupled with the almost reflexive rejection that some jamaicans ayard seem to have of suggestions from jamaicans abroad recently it is an easy and ready gimmick to dismiss the truth of any observers comments the sad news for jamaicans ayard is that the situation is not improved by ignoring the truth regardless of the source of the truth the gunshots will still continue to fly over and into our heads until we confront the real problems and not the symptoms

1906665 it truly was a once in a lifetime chance and it was an honour to have daniels advice and expertise the fact that he also signed photos for my daughters means the world to me and might score me some brownie points with my eldest who tends to think her daddy is embarrassing

1906702 i was too busy getting raped by a bull to do my homework
1906703 that is odd perhaps they didnt know they were in america perhaps this was some mistake
1906704 i thought how are they moving the stage because this is part of the building
1906705 then i thought no thats not right and i thought maybe were on some kind of rug and theyre pulling it out from underneath us then i thought that it could be an earthquake or third day could be rocking california so hard that it makes the ground shake
1906706 any kind of tv or video thing always makes me nervous
1906707 people ask all the time if i get nervous before going on stage and i dont before a normal concert or show its always when youre doing something outside of the norm theres going to be a few million people watching tonight and it makes me a little nervous but even more excited than nervous
1906708 but i just feel like this is really a big deal im really trying to soak this in and doing that is making me appreciate this as a big opportunity i feel like its bigger than just us i feel like were representing all of christian music were really proud to be a part of that its a great place to be and this is the kind of opportunity that shows christian music is not just a subgenre defined by its lyrical content or where people spend their sunday mornings christian music can really stand on its own
1906709 we were so excited about the opportunity and now were glad its over
1906710 it took all that work and we traveled across the country for three minutes and 30 seconds
1906711 its all a blur but i feel really good about it
1906712 being on stage at the tonight show doing our sound check during an earthquake thats the story were going to take away from today
1906713 thats the first time ive been in anything like that
1906714 for me the thing ill remember is that its album release day
1906715 for us to have this album which is one of our favorite records and to be able to kick it off by being on the tonight show thats what ill remember

1906718 baghdad for now appears to be drawing the line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or cbw against the united states fearing that exposure of iraqi involvement would provide washington a sronger case for making war iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the us homehand if baghdad feared that an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable
1906719 its not actually a counter argument because skippy is talking about impeachment and bugliosi is talking a criminal prosecution in a court of law with a jury

1906729 second peter chapter three tells us there are three earth ages and three heavenly ages paul was taken to the third heavenly age 2 corinthians 12 3 5
1906730 paul made a conscious decision to chose to glory in his weakness rather than the fact he was taken to the third heaven but why would he make such a choice because there was a thorn involved 2 corinthians 12 6 7

1906746 the fbi apparently applied a lot of pressure to all the investigators there at detrick and they found the weakest link
1906747 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him

1906756 the drying device known as a lyophilizer could help investigators explain how he might have been able to send letters containing deadly anthrax spores to u s senators and news organizations
1906757 the device was not commonly used by researchers at the armys sprawling biodefense complex at fort detrick md
1906758 if you google lyophilize and anthrax most of the pages returned are about anthrax vaccines which is what dr ivins was working on at ft detrick
1906759 let me reiterate no matter how good the microbial forensics may be they can only at best link the anthrax to a particular strain and lab they cannot link it to any individual

1906784 i can discern no single party or interest group at fault it seems to come from all portions of the political spectrum but it is truly an unfortunate situation
1906785 yes there are some folks who try to take the high road even some town government staff will occasionally post comments to explain a policy or situation
1906786 the most regrettable thing in this whole bunch of ugliness is that a tool that reasonable people could be using for the rational and constructive exchange of ideas has been hijacked by a handful of unfortunate souls who cannot resist trying to have the last word no matter how mean it is
1906787 i must have also missed the blog where you stated the

1906789 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible team on the field
1906790 we just felt like this was an opportunity to go get somebody of bretts stature and what hes accomplished
1906791 we felt it was in the best interest of the team and when the opportunity presented itself we felt it was the right move for us to make and we went ahead and did it
1906792 we had discussions with him and his agent bus cook

1906801 hezbollah is incapable of penetrating and exploiting the israeli armys tactical radio systems as it claimed it did during the recent fighting in lebanon say senior u s electronics industry officials
1906802 what theyre really doing is a very good psychological operation
1906803 one of the things you want to do is instill doubt hezbollah makes the pronouncement that they can read encrypted radios they wanted the idf troops to believe they werent as invulnerable as they thought they scored big time
1906804 everybody out there has a cell phone you see any picture of troops on the street in

1906830 one way to think of these startling correlations is to accept the possibility that the instruments have captured the reaction of a global consciousness beginning to form the network was built to do just that to see whether we could gather evidence of a communal shared mind in which we are participants even if we dont know it groups of people including the group that is the whole world have a place in consciousness space and under special circumstances they or we become a new presence based on evidence that both individuals and groups manifest something we can tentatively call a consciousness field we hypothesized that there could be a global consciousness capable of the same thing pursuing the speculation it would seem that the new integrated mind is just beginning to be active paying attention only to events that inspire strong coherence of attention and feeling perhaps the best image is an infant slowly developing awareness but already capable of strong emotions in response to the comfort of cuddling or to the discomfort of pain

1906840 when she lowers her eyes she seems to hold all the beauty in the world between her eyelids when she raises them i see only myself in her gaze
1906841 when youre in love you never really know whether your elation comes from the qualities of the one you love or if it attributes them to her whether the light which surrounds her like a halo comes from you from her or from the meeting of your sparks

1906844 we are a little perplexed at this point to tell you the truth
1906845 after that we were more cautious about standing in one place for too long
1906846 im retired but this is what i love to do
1906847 we dont know how long this particular thing has been burning
1906848 weve been researching it for a while and dont have all the answers

1906856 were happy to have reached an agreement that has significant benefits for both the lake and the fight against global warming these environmental protections help ensure lake michigan is a healthy natural resource for generations to come
1906857 in the long run this agreement will result in dramatic improvements to the overall health of lake michigan and will contribute to the development of renewable energy sources such as solar and biomass
1906858 it will help us address two of the most critical issues of our time climate change and protection of one of the worlds greatest freshwater natural resources

1906860 for those whom he foreknew he also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son so that he would be the firstborn among many brethren
1906861 are more likely to be effective there than almost anywhere else i can imagine
1906862 the tatas pulled out from west bengal no other industrialists would even consider coming to the state in future
1906863 i have never seen any country that has progressed without industrialisation agriculture alone cannot help industrialisation is a must and i support the west bengal governments industrial policy and the tata motors car project in singur
1906864 we dont want to send a message to anybody if anybody wants to talk to us we can talk a dialogue is political courtesy what we accept or not is different i feel the state government should take an initiative if they want the tata motors factory
1906865 as long as our patience lasts we will be at singur
1906866 we will launch a state wide propaganda that the tatas have left because of her
1906867 difference between the bank of sweden prize and the others nobel prizes is in my opinion evident from its name and the authorities in sweden responsible for the selection of the laureates consistently repeat it
1906868 i fail to see that any reasonable ground for confusion if some news media omit the difference in every report about the prize in economics it is not in my opinion an omission for which swedish authoritiesshould be made responsible
1906869 well deliberated action in support of social and political as well as economic changes to the conditions that govern our lives and work
1906870 a significant broadening of national and international efforts to promote equity and protect the rights of workers can transform the dreaded anticipation of the globalization economy into an agreeable and constructive reality
1906871 universal coverage of all working people including unregulated wage workers the self employed and homeworkers
1906872 given the massive levels of unemployment that exist in many countries today it is right that policy attention be focused on expanding jobs and working opportunities and yet the conditions of work are important too
1906873 often exaggerated and is typically based on very rudimentary reasoning
1906874 even when trade offs have to be faced they can be more reasonably addressed by taking a broader and inclusive approach rather than by simply giving full priority to just one group over another
1906875 acknowledging certain basic rights whether or not they are legislated as part of a decent society the practical implications that emanate from this acknowledgement go beyond new legislation to other social political and economic actions
1906876 it is a remarkable fact in the history of famines that famines do not occur in democracies because famines are in fact easy to prevent and a government in a multi party democracy with election and a free media has strong political incentives to undertake famine prevention
1906877 political freedom in the form of democratic arrangements help to safeguard economic freedom and the freedom to survive
1906878 bring out among other things the penalty of undemocratic governance
1906879 the chief minister will attend an all party meeting at 9 30 a m in tamluk on august nine in the wake of the recent developments in nandigram
1906880 we have neither received any letter nor any proposal from the tatas that they wish to pull out from singur
1906881 if we have to return the land we will have to acquire it elsewhere that would create fresh trouble
1906882 whatever i had to tell the opposition i have said in the assembly and also outside i do not have anything new to add
1906883 we have got no such information from tata motors that they want to roll back from the singur project the project work is almost nearing completion and i hope the nano car will roll out from the factory on time
1906884 there is no question of giving land back the state government has no extra land to return to the unwilling farmers in singur if we want to do that we have to acquire fresh land from other areas and in that case the same problem may arise once again
1906885 during the meeting tata motors officials said they are committed to the project we discussed the security matters of the project site also to ensure security to the workers at the factory we will try to deploy more police personnel there the tatas are trying to strengthen the number of private security men
1906886 the project is important to reduce the poverty level of west bengal
1906887 if the state government does not return land we will go on an indefinite agitation the singur movement will be carried out in a democratic manner and it will have an impact on the entire nation
1906888 the manmohan singh government is afraid of facing the parliament failure to maintain its majority in parliament before that nsg clearance would jeopardise the nuclear deal with the united states
1906889 the reason is clear after having manipulated a majority by foul means the government is not confident of facing parliament where its majority will be in question
1906890 the government will not move away from singur and nor will the tatas back out
1906891 it is not possible to return 400 acres of land if that is done the tata factory will be shut down
1906892 this is not like buying four shirts and then returning three because you did not like them if the factory does not come up what will happen to the 6 000 or so people waiting for jobs
1906893 i am not interested in whether the tatas or birlas build the project nor am i interested in whether the car will be priced at rs 1 lakh or not or who will ride the car we want the project for the jobs it will create
1906894 there is no alternative to industrialisation no nation has progressed and developed solely on agriculture

1906960 it is clear that our health care system isnt giving americans the health care they need and deserve
1906961 the disorganization and inefficiency are affecting americans in their everyday lives and its obvious that people are looking for reform with the upcoming election there is great opportunity for our leaders to hear what the american people are saying they want from a health care system and to respond with meaningful proposals
1906962 there is no one policy or practice that will make our health care system run like an efficient well oiled machine
1906963 this is going to take strong national leadership and a commitment from all of the players in our health care system but with that and the strategies outlined in this report real progress could be made
1906964 i questioned the need for it and i still have those concerns

1907018 this is accompanied by an increase in attentiveness to social rewards and information

1907021 which is important in controlling impulsive behavior or resisting peer pressure

1907026 i move non credono nella violenza ma nellautodifesa lautodifesa e un diritto dato da dio la strategia e rispondere con le stesse armi se la polizia di philadelphia viene con il pugno noi risponderemo con i pugni se vengono con i bastoni noi risponderemo con i bastoni se verranno con le armi noi useremo le armi perch la polizia non sapr come comportarsi perch loro capiscono solo quel tipo di linguaggio loro si sentono forti solo perch hanno le pistole e se noi avremo le pistole loro avranno paura questa strategia rivoluzionaria questo quello che john africa ha insegnato ai move john africa ci ha insegnato che tutto quello che il governo ha e fa intimidazione terrore trovare il modo di dimostrare il suo potere se noi togliamo loro la possibilit di intimidire non intimidendoci dimostreremo che il governo senza potere non hanno pi nessun potere su di noi questo il motivo per cui il sistema ha paura di john africa perch questa la determinazione che john africa ha insegnato ai move se tutti quanti scacciassero la paura che il potere infonde come hanno fatto i move non avremmo pi oppressori noi avremmo la libert e luguaglianza nel 1978 i move cominciarono ad essere imprigionati per lunghi anni john africa disse che ci sarebbe stato un periodo in cui i move sarebbero passati per le galere john africa ci disse che sarebbe stato necessario continuare a dare questo esempio di lotta rivoluzionaria perch la gente vuole un cambiamento ma non vede lalternativa unalternativa che sia credibile e che servir a rivoluzionarli ed per questo che importante dare lesempio a cui potersi affidare e avere delle persone in cui poter credere un esempio intramontabile forte della critica contro il sistema un esempio che sarebbe rimasto sempre fedele alla lotta rivoluzionaria di coerenza agli ideali di libert questo lesempio che i move portano avanti da oltre 25 anni quando alfonso ramona ed io fummo arrestati ci fu detto dai giudici che se volevamo uscirne vivi avremmo dovuto abbandonare i move ricordatevi che negli stati uniti ci dovrebbe essere addirittura la libert di religione di pensiero e di idee move la nostra religione il nostro modo di vivere ma loro ci hanno detto che se noi avessimo lasciato i move la nostra religione saremmo stati liberi alfonso sposato ed ha 5 figli di conseguenza ci che gli chiedevano era di abbandonare la sua famiglia la sua vita oppure stare in prigione anche ramona ha un marito e dei figli ci rifiutammo di andare contro noi stessi alfonso fu condannato a 5 anni di carcere invece che 2 ramona fu condannata a 7 anni di carcere invece che 2 io fui condannata a 12 anni invece che 6 tutto perch noi rimanemmo fedeli alla nostra vita alle nostre idee fu facile per noi decidere malgrado ai move non piaccia affatto la prigione a nessuno piace la prigione ma i move non sono confusi sul significato di libert la libert non uscire da un palazzo ed andare in un altro a comperare della pizza questo ci che il sistema fa credere alla gente questo ci che il sistema chiama libert libert avere la forza e la coerenza della propria libert e di lottare per la libert degli altri come si pu farlo se si va contro quello in cui si crede questa strategia rivoluzionaria john africa ce lo ha insegnato dando lui per primo un esempio di coerenza e di fedelt alle proprie idee partendo da se stessi solo cosi noi possiamo essere lesempio che non tradir la gente nove move in questo momento sono in prigione 4 donne e 5 uomini sono in prigione da 18 anni e hanno accuse per 100 anni ognuno questo malgrado il fatto che anche loro sapevano che se avessero ritrattato sarebbero stati liberi avrebbero dovuto lasciare i move questo prova il fatto che i move sono in carcere non perch sono dei criminali ma perch sono move e io ve lo posso provare nel 1978 durante un confronto dove furono arrestate 9 persone per lomicidio di un poliziotto ucciso da un proiettile tutte e 9 furono accusate di questo omicidio come se fosse possibile che tutte e 9 abbiano sparato insieme lo stesso proiettile i move dimostrarono che era impossibile per questi 9 uccidere quel poliziotto queste erano le prove che mumia stava ricercando e diffondendo quando fu licenziato ed imprigionato oltre le 9 persone furono arrestati anche 3 simpatizzanti dei move ed il giorno del confronto erano tutti insieme il giudice domand loro se erano dei membri dei move loro dissero no gli chiesero se avevano intenzione di diventare move un giorno loro dissero no furono tutti rilasciati questo prova il fatto che move sono in carcere non per i fatti a loro contestati ma perch sono move questo lesempio di come il governo degli stati uniti distrugge i suoi oppositori questa la vera ragione per cui la casa dei move fu bombardata arrivarono con centinaia di poliziotti arrivarono con ogni tipo di arma incluso un missile anticarro loro avevano gli m 16 ed ogni altro tipo di arma da guerra spararono oltre 10 000 proiettili su quella casa tutto per 11 persone e 5 bambini i giudici dissero che in fondo i bambini erano dei nemici tanto quanto gli adulti loro volevano uccidere lesempio rivoluzionario sia nei bambini che negli adulti ed per questo che ci bombardarono diedero lordine ai pompieri di non spegnere il fuoco eppure il compito dei pompieri proprio quello di spegnere gli incendi tutto il vicinato prese cos fuoco 62 case furono incendiate ma a loro non interessava erano determinati ad uccidere ogni membro dei move non avevano considerato che ramona sarebbe riuscita ad uscire con il suo bambino testimoniando cos ci che loro avevano fatto loro uccisero tutti quelli che tentarono di uscire dalla casa cera chi aveva i bambini in braccio i cadaveri dei bambini e degli adulti erano pieni di proiettili non c nessun poliziotto nessun ufficiale che in prigione per questo ramona ha fatto 7 anni di carcere anche mio figlio fu ucciso io ero in prigione con mia sorella ed anche suo figlio fu ucciso noi non sapevamo cosa stesse accadendo fuori eravamo in isolamento gli altri carcerati lo urlarono fuori dalle celle per farcelo sapere fino a quando un poliziotto non apr la porta della mia cella e mi disse che mio figlio era stato ucciso che la figlia di mia sorella era morta questo il paese che gira per il mondo predicando la pace predicando i diritti umani gli stati uniti sono i leader delloppressione e dello sterminio nel mondo noi abbiamo un solo nemico loppressore noi dobbiamo essere uniti al di l dellideologia noi dobbiamo combattere insieme per distruggere questo nemico gli stati uniti sono la testa di questo mostro i move sono tra quelli che gli taglieranno la testa e per questo che combattiamo con e per mumia abu jamal combattiamo per silvia per i move e per tutti i prigionieri politici lunga vita alla rivoluzione lunga vita a john africa

1907143 j c penney was deeply disappointed to learn that our name and logo were used in the creation and distribution of a commercial that was submitted to the 2008 international advertising festival at cannes no one at j c penney was aware of the ad or participated in the creation of it in any way the commercial was never broadcast but rather was created by a former employee at j c penneys advertising agency saatchi amp saatchi solely as an award submission without j c penneys knowledge or prior approval j c penney does not approve or condone its content and we have asked saatchi amp saatchi to remove the ad from online circulation and to apologize to our customers and our associates for misrepresenting our company in this manner

1907157 of the wise among us some consider the holy ghost an influence 1 others a creature others god himself and again others know not which way to decide from reverence as they say for the holy scripture which declares nothing exact in the case for this reason they waver between worshipping and not worshipping the holy ghost and strike a middle course which is in fact however a bad one
1907158 the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the highest will overshadow you therefore also that holy one who is to be born will be called the son of god

1907194 who cant wait to go where few have gone before
1907195 why women are not mentioned in islamic sources quran and hadith as much as men
1907196 for muslim men and women for believing men and women for devout men and women for true men and women for men and women who are patient and constant for men and women who humble themselves for men and women who give in charity for men and women who fast and deny themselves for men and women who guard their chastity and for men and women who engage much in allahs praise for them has allah prepared forgiveness and great reward
1907197 one of the longest chapters in quran is named the women another chapter is named mariam
1907198 we need to separate between what some of the muslims practice and what islam is ordering us to do
1907199 does islam contain within itself the keys to liberate women within contemporary islamic societies
1907200 then i saw the hell fire and i have never before seen such a horrible sight as that and i saw that the majority of its dwellers were women
1907201 do they disbelieve in allah are they ungrateful to allah
1907202 they are not thankful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors done to them
1907203 if a woman is unsatisfied she can obtain a divorce
1907204 if a husband calls his wife to his bed i e to have sexual relation and she refuses and causes him to sleep in anger the angels will curse her till morning
1907205 never will i allow to be lost the work of any of you whether male or female you are of one another
1907206 and whoever does righteous deeds whether male or female while being a believer those will enter heaven and will not be wronged even as much as the speck on a date seed
1907207 if they husband and his wife desire to wean the child by mutual consent and after consultation there is no blame on them
1907208 the best of you is the best to his family and i am the best among you to my family the most perfect believers are the best in conduct and best of you are those who are best to their wives
1907209 under the sharia women are not allowed to divorce even if their husband beats them the decision to divorce rest only on mans whims
1907210 imagine if all muslims were to stone or hang victims of rape or flog women for minor offenses such as exposing a flock of hair
1907211 as regards the individual nature woman is defective and misbegotten for the active power of the male seed tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex while the production of a woman comes from a defect in the active power
1907212 the sentence of god on this sex of yours lives in this age the guilt must of necessity live too
1907213 approach your wives with foreplay please your wife to orgasm several times before you please yourself
1907214 he created for you of yourselves spouses that you may repose in them
1907215 his saying created for you is a proof that women were created like animals and plants and other useful things just as the most high has said he created for you what is on earth and that necessitates the woman not to be created for worship and carrying the divine commands
1907216 in islam if the husband beats a wife without respecting the limits set down by the quran and hadith then she can take him to court and if ruled in her favor she can be given the right to apply the law of retaliation and beat the husband as he beat her
1907217 in islam victims of rape are not punished in anyway they are victims
1907218 i was about to order for collecting firewood and then order someone to pronounce the adhan for the prayer and then order someone to lead the people in prayer and then i would go from behind and burn the houses of men who did not present themselves for the compulsory congregational prayer
1907219 by betty mahmoodi is a true story and it has happened to countless western women who married to muslim men
1907220 if i were beaten by anybody husband or no you can bet your life i would fight back
1907221 there is nothing anywhere in any of the texts that tells women to take beatings from anyone
1907222 there is no real islamic society today on the national level there is no real and complete implementation of sharia law
1907223 the prophet said a man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife
1907224 if islam is looking down to sic women the chapter would not have been called the women or at least you would find another chapter called the men
1907225 this does not mean in anyway that a sister is worth half of her brother
1907226 this variation in inheritance shares is only consistent with the variations in financial responsibilities
1907227 that if a women becomes captive in a war her muslim master is allowed to rape her

1907229 allahs apostle said if a husband calls his wife to his bed i
1907230 the problem with many islam bashers is that they keep their eyes away from any hadith that explains certain aspects of the quran verses
1907231 actually in a fast comparison with the biblical teachings regarding that issue we can see that if a wife entices her husband to worship other than god then he should stone her to death deuteronomy 13 7 12
1907232 that women will form the majority of the people of see sahih muslim kitaab al jannah 4 2179 no 2834
1907233 muhammad reported that some persons stated with a sense of pride and some discussed whether there would be more men in or more women it was upon this that abu huraira reported that abul qasim the holy prophet may peace be upon him said the members of the first group to get into paradise would have their faces as bright as full moon during the night and the next to this group would have their faces as bright as the shining stars in the sky and every person would have two wives and the marrow of their shanks would glimmer beneath the flesh and there would be none without a wife in paradise
1907234 imagine if all muslims were to stone or hang victims of rape or flog women for minor offenses such as exposing a flock of hair
1907235 shall we blame islam for what the christian men are doing in the let alone philippine chili sic etc
1907236 there is nothing anywhere in any of the texts that tells women to take beatings from anyone
1907237 there is no real islamic society today on the national level there is no real and complete implementation of sharia law therefore how can anyone criticize sharia law
1907238 for those who criticize the quran to investigate the possibility of mistranslation when reading it
1907239 pack your bags get your kids and go to a shelter
1907240 they shall have all that they will desire with their lord that is the reward of the good doers
1907241 and as for those who believe they know that it is the truth from their lord but as for those who disbelieve they say what did allah intend by this parable by it he misleads many and many he guides thereby and he misleads thereby only those who are al fasiqun the rebellious disobedient to allah
1907242 there is no real and complete implementation of sharia law
1907243 that is an amazing statement after 1400 years 1 2 billion muslims have not managed to implement the sharia law in any of the 57 islamic countries isnt it reasonable to conclude that such a utopian islamic paradise exists nowhere except in ms roachs fantasies

1907291 one way to think of these startling correlations is to accept the possibility that the instruments have captured the reaction of a global consciousness beginning to form the network was built to do just that to see whether we could gather evidence of a communal shared mind in which we are participants even if we dont know it groups of people including the group that is the whole world have a place in consciousness space and under special circumstances they or we become a new presence based on evidence that both individuals and groups manifest something we can tentatively call a consciousness field we hypothesized that there could be a global consciousness capable of the same thing pursuing the speculation it would seem that the new integrated mind is just beginning to be active paying attention only to events that inspire strong coherence of attention and feeling perhaps the best image is an infant slowly developing awareness but already capable of strong emotions in response to the comfort of cuddling or to the discomfort of pain

1907324 ya tempat ini menjadi lokasi rendezvous kita yang sangat indah sekaligus aman
1907325 untuk menjadi sahabat untuk saling mendengarkan dengan hati dan untuk saling menyemangati
1907326 yup kamu pandai membaca jalan pikiranku tapi itu juga kalau kamu setuju
1907327 aku tahu aku juga sedih tapi bukankah kita sama sama sepakat untuk tidak melanjutkan rasa bersalah
1907328 kamu benar satu hal yang perlu kamu tahu aku mencintai bicaramu cara berpikirmu caramu menyikapi banyak hal kamu seksi
1907329 aku tahu toh kalau kamu punya suatu hari juga akan kendur
1907330 akui sajalah kalau aku tidak aneh kamu akan memilih yang lain
1907331 oke oke jujur aku pengen kamu cium untuk yang terakhir kali
1907332 aku ingin hujan turun sekarang membuat tubuh kita basah kuyup dan kedinginan
1907333 lalu kita berciuman diantara hujan diantara pinus pinus ini kamu ingat pertama kali kita berciuman
1907334 ahh kenapa sih laki laki sering melupakan momen momen romantis seperti itu
1907335 kamu ingat sore itu di tepi pantai di dalam mobilku aku menangis karena cemburu karena kita saling mencintai tapi secara de facto kamu milik perempuan lain
1907336 oh iya sejak itu aku sadar bahwa ternyata kissing itu bisa memberi efek yang menenangkan
1907337 mana mungkin aku cuma pura pura lupa sejujurnya aku sulit untuk melupakan momen itu
1907338 bagus kalau begitu waktu itu aku menangis kita berciuman sementara air mataku jatuh menetes hingga membasahi bibir kita hmmhh
1907339 itu alasan mengapa kamu ingin kita berciuman diantara hujan turun karena kamu ingin hujan yang membasahi bibir kita pada ciuman terakhir bukan air mata
1907340 hmm aku juga sangat ingin ingin sekali tapi hujan tidak akan turun hari ini
1907341 lalu kamu akan berdoa selama itu untuk meminta hujan turun dari langit
1907342 mungkin tapi lebih baik kita tunggu lihat angin mulai berhembus cepat diatas sana mungkin sebentar lagi langit jadi gelap dan turun hujan
1907343 kita sudah tiga perempat jam disini mendung tapi tidak juga turun hujan kita pulang saja
1907344 at age seven i realized there was a big difference between my life and theirs
1907345 i was beginning to wonder about suffering and why the world was neither fair nor just
1907346 going abroad and seeing other cultures really jolts people that way
1907347 they see how many things impact health such as access to clean water food education and social support i know that my work in uganda has helped me to be a better doctor in belleville because im more attuned to peoples lives in the context of their families and their communities
1907348 im more attuned to prevention health behaviors end of life care its essential to see people as part of a network
1907349 when i went to medical school i knew i wanted to do something international
1907350 i felt strongly that our family should live and work abroad together
1907351 my job was to see how a doctor could improve the quality and delivery of health services
1907352 he said you are the most educated person who has ever visited our village and thank you for coming to train the village health workers
1907353 but the problem is that we dont have access to clean water
1907354 we can serve as advocates bring visibility and champion a cause

1907356 many of the students come from small towns in wisconsin and have never been out of the country before
1907357 this year we took one who had never been on a plane
1907358 once students return they see healthcare in an entirely new light
1907359 it gives them the mindset of caring for populations instead of individuals here we train doctors to take care of patients one at a time but public health has a different approach it teaches health workers to consider the patients entire network
1907360 after the war there were horrible sites where there were mounds of skulls and body parts piled up wherever you looked
1907361 when i went back the amazing thing was that the village looked like that mural

1907365 self why do i read and why do they not read
1907366 reading is easy i used to read a lot when i was younger and it has carried through until now so i dont need to read recreationally any more
1907367 fewer than one fourth of 17 year olds for example read almost every day for fun and young people 15 to 24 read 10 minutes or less a day on average according to various federal statistics during their voluntary reading time time spent reading texts not required for school or work middle and high school students regularly watch television listen to music or use other media
1907368 increasing use of electronic media is largely to blame for a decline in pleasure reading among young people says the report released today but the failure of schools to instill a love of reading is also a contributing factor
1907369 uninterrupted sustained silent reading time lets students practice reading and read for their own purpose and pleasure
1907370 it is appointed for men once to die then the judgment

1907379 let there be no mistake the proposal put forward today by sens

1907381 there was ample opportunity for democrats like whelan and van drew to consider specific cuts to the state budget which would have allowed funds to be re allocated to support state police patrols in rural communities
1907382 both senators supported the budget despite their being well aware that it would require the affected municipalities to pay the cost of state police patrols
1907383 no matter how they try to disguise their proposal it is and always will be a tax increase and a clear sign that both of them failed in their obligation to represent the best interests of the people who have relied historically on state police protection

1907784 i wanted to say thank you for having the passion to heal i came to you with an open mind not knowing what to expect from the break through but i must say it was an experience that i will never forget and i will be able to take it through the rest of my life because it aloud me to face a mirror of fears that were deeply hidden they were brought to the forefront and i had no choice but to battle them and flush it out of my system the results did not come instantly but they happened and the most amazing thing was that as timed passed on it was almost like those negative habits and thoughts in the situation never even affected me i dont even feel the same way i cant even remember the negative feeling i felt because within those moments with you i was dropping them like weights and as time went on they were left behind this experience was very uplifting and im more balanced then ever thank you again and you truly have an amazing gift i just could not help to write it in detail

1907800 paul woke up a little after you left and lynx called me a little before we both got here around the same time
1907801 you were almost dead he started shaking you and i had to drag your spirit back
1907802 she was an anomaly children are already filled with so much potential with energy that when they go bad they go bad so she was a ghost that was already worse than plenty of others and she became a ghost that learned how to feed on other ghosts gaining a measure of life as she went and all that extra energy pushed her even further off the deep end only life isnt quite the right word though you could almost consider her a zombie i suppose she was certainly more undead than anything else
1907803 i guess that explains the whole her eating people thing
1907804 but not how she figured out how to eat other ghosts or why stuffing herself with all that energy gave her solidity

1907824 this must be what my church has been talking about all these years what is happening to me must be the baptism in the holy spirit
1907825 and they were all filled with the holy spirit and began to speak in other tongues
1907826 he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing
1907827 we believe speaking in tongues is the unmistakable initial evidence of the baptism in the holy spirit
1907828 without question some believers who do not speak in tongues have accomplished great things for god
1907829 the two statements made by the assemblies of god above contradict each other

1907890 when you can beat your own defense which knows your plays and beat them every day then we can beat anybody in the country thats where we need to get to beat these guys every day
1907891 it gives us a little leeway with our initial plan
1907892 we got better from the first to the second day
1907893 we had new plays in the third so well be better
1907894 weve got a good defense were always going to get a good look from them its good for us to go against them theyre going to be one of the better defenses we face this season

1907921 a presidential inauguration is a time for faculty staff students alumni and friends of the university to celebrate yet another milestone in our impressive history as one of ohios senior public universities
1907922 we need todays faculty to conceive the innovations of the future in the fields of the future from nanoscience to neuroscience from molecular biology to media psychology and we need them to continue exploring our rich past in architecture archeology and art
1907923 the function of the university is not simply to teach breadwinning or to furnish teachers for the public schools or to be a centre of polite society it is above all to be the organ of that fine adjustment between real life and the growing knowledge of life an adjustment which forms the secret of civilization

1907937 its a look back on the time leading up to during and after we dropped nukes on hiroshima and nagasaki via never before seen footage and interviews with surviors of those towns estimated 200 000 survivors and almost 300 000 killed innocent civilians along with the men who flew on the enola gay and dropped the little boy and later the fat man id advise not watching it while drinking wine which is what i did actually the wine had little to do with the tears i shed for about the whole time i was watching it i cried because of the people they interviewed a woman and her sister were looking for their mother after the explosion eventually they found a charred body with the eyes missing and it was their mom these girls were 8 and 10 can you even imagine the stories like that went on and on and on children charred from the bomb screaming for a mother and father they would never see again people burned but not dead in so much pain asking nurses and doctors to kill them the footage of both cities after the bombs hit was really difficult to see i cried when they showed footage of 2 million americans swarming into times square to gleefully celebrate the end of the war after trumans annoucement oblivious to what was going on in japan at the time japans surrender a blessing to be sure but at what cost it should have been a sobering moment a somber moment i cried because atomic bombs were made then dropped on heavily populated areas dropped with what seemed to be only an inkling of the kind of immediate and long term damage that would be caused or maybe they knew is that worse war is nasty evil dirty i stuggled last night to find words to express the distress because while weve not been dropping nukes on people recently it would seem weve yet to learn from our mistakes i saw this in the new york times a few weeks ago in an op ed piece every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and not clothed this world in arms is not spending money alone it is spending the sweat of its laborers the genius of its scientists the hopes of its children

1907950 being happy doesnt mean that everything is perfect it means that youve decided to look beyond the imperfections
1907951 happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life the whole aim and end of human existence
1907952 love is the condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own
1907953 we tend to forget that happiness doesnt come as a result of getting something we dont have but rather of recognizing and appreciating what we do have
1907954 people love others not for who they are but for how they make them feel
1907955 love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own

1907962 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
1907963 es lo mismo que ocurr a en los golpes de estado de los a os 80
1907964 estamos hablando de una estrategia ya no tanto dirigida a impedir el referendo sino que busca la desestabilizaci n del orden constitucional de desplomar el orden democr tico
1907965 por todo lo que est ocurriendo en tarija santa cruz pando y beni tenemos que denunciar ante los bolivianos ante la comunidad internacional y ante los observadores que se encuentran en el pa s que estamos en el umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional este es un montaje de golpe de estado al t pico estilo de las dictaduras para cualquier ciudadano de cualquier otro pa s donde se vive en democracia lo que hoy d a est n haciendo los prefectos no es nada m s que un acto de sedici n de desacato de organizaci n de fuerzas ilegales paramilitares para atentar contra todas las libertades p blicas
1907966 la organizaci n de grupos facciosos violentos desde las propias prefecturas pagados con la plata del pueblo no es nada m s que eso un verdadero golpe al orden constitucional la irradiaci n de este modelo de violencia llevado adelante por la uni n juvenil cruce ista al resto de los departamentos la forma como las prefecturas emplean los recursos p blicos para impedir que la gente vaya a las urnas el 10 de agosto la forma como financian a organizaciones sociales como el caso de los discapacitados de los mineros en alg n caso de los transportistas es un verdadero complot no s lo contra el gobierno sino contra la constituci n pol tica del estado y el objetivo de todo esto es derrocar sacar al presidente evo morales del gobierno nacional
1907967 hoy d a est n ante un escenario de derrota anticipada de una derrota abrumadora frente a ello no atinan a usar a emplear otra herramienta m s que la violencia la intimidaci n el chantaje el silenciamiento de la opini n p blica

1907973 we found that the actual incidence of gastrointestinal gi bleeding would make it an uncommon complication
1907974 but when it does arise it appears to be associated with increased death and disability
1907975 one of the key points we want to raise is that people are generally prone to developing medical complications with stroke
1907976 and as part of that larger observation we know that among these complications are gi issues and we feel that this is particularly important because gastrointestinal bleeding is a complication that is potentially modifiable with various treatment strategies
1907977 having a poorer outcome in stroke patients with gastrointestinal bleeding is not surprising at all
1907978 but i dont know based on this kind of a retrospective study if we can tell how preventable this is as there are all sorts of things that the researchers may not be measuring that might affect the results
1907979 we treat all our stroke patients with preventive prophylactic therapy to prevent gi bleeding and our experience is that gi bleeding is a rare event so its really not something we get too concerned about
1907980 and that means that the fact that this study shows an increased risk of death associated with gi bleeding says to me that a gastrointestinal problem is simply a marker for someone who is a lot sicker not an independent factor directly related to the stroke itself
1907981 so i dont think this finding gives us much useful new information
1907982 let no unwholesome words come out of your computer but only what is constructive in order to meet the need of the moment that what you communicate will give grace to everyone who ever reads it
1907983 prov 25 23 everybody gets upset at somebody else slanderer slanderee slander hearer
1907984 you know how they do things around here yadda yadda what do you expect
1907985 one seldom knows the full facts v 8 and ones motives in spreading a story are seldom as pure as one pretends v 10 to run to the law or to the neighbors is usually to run away from the duty of personal relationship
1907986 if your brother sins against you go and tell him his fault between you and him alone if he listens to you you have gained your brother
1907987 patients may not be learning this information from their health care providers and information regarding colon cancer prevention is not as well publicized as it could be
1907988 in the context of busy clinic visits it is in some ways efficient for patients to be reminded that physical activity is good for their health in general going through each specific health benefit of physical activity would take considerable time
1907989 sedentary people should first set such moderate achievable goals more benefits could accrue from higher levels and more intense exercise such as jogging running or tennis to some extent more may be better but it is important to note that a little is much better than nothing
1907990 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
1907991 apart from the odd speeding car buildings landscape and walls around us all move past us at slow and predictable speeds our brains are constantly building up a statistical picture of the world around and based on experience it is a statistically slow world
1907992 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
1907993 although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience
1907994 capitalizing on natures design is a good way of building artificial visual systems for robots as humans get visual judgments right a lot more often than the best current robot systems further knowing the situations in which humans get it wrong is a useful starting point for the design of assistive devices to help correct those errors before they have serious consequences
1907995 you know what ed and i laugh about it its kind of funny people think that but they dont realize that er its obviously er its just so amazing the way something can be just a complete fabrication yet it gets twisted
1907996 just as the eyes are the window to the soul the eyes are also a window into social development
1907997 the earlier we are able to identify children the better it is because early interventions make a difference in optimizing childrens outcomes
1907998 weve always had a sense that children with autism dont make eye contact but this study confirms it in a higher tech way
1907999 i was really hoping to bathe the kids and put them to bed but unfortunately i wont be able to tonight in fact ill need the entire room to myself for this call
1908000 it looks like moderate drinking has been increasing heavy drinking is down a little bit and total alcohol consumption is down a little bit
1908001 it is encouraging news that more people are drinking moderately and the average intake is coming down rather than shooting up
1908002 it generally tends to reflect trends within the country among middle class white americans
1908003 people drank about a third more back in the 50s and 60s than they did in the 70s up to 2004
1908004 at the same time theres been a decrease in beer and an increase in wine consumption among people but the average intake has decreased
1908005 the data are very clear that light to moderate drinking without binge drinking is generally good for health whereas a larger amount of binge drinking is bad it looks like in this population its going in the right direction
1908006 this is really intended as a wake up call to show what could happen if nothing changes
1908007 it really needs to be more than an individual effort
1908008 prior studies have looked at atrial fibrillation in young and middle aged and generally healthy people
1908009 they found that for example marathon runners have a higher risk of atrial fibrillation but the vast majority of atrial fibrillation occurs later in life after 65 about one in five people develops atrial fibrillation over 10 years
1908010 no one has looked at exercise and atrial fibrillation in these older people
1908011 we found that light to moderate exercise such as walking 10 blocks a week was associated with a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation
1908012 we have enrolled patients who have atrial fibrillation already to see whether exercise improves their quality of life
1908013 preliminary data appears to be that they feel better and function better

1908018 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1908019 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1908020 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1908021 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

1908035 el n mero de personas que aprendi pragm ticamente el uso de internet en los cibercaf s es superior al de quienes se instruyeron en sus hogares y supera a los que aprendieron en sus lugares de trabajo dejando en un lejano cuarto lugar a las instituciones educativas

1908070 i cant help but be amazed at how far video games have come in the past decade and with that in mind im left wondering why the new release rack at blockbuster is still filled with 90 percent garbage for a business that relies on entertaining people the movie industry really needs to take some pages out of the video game play book video games have become the most entertaining form of enjoyment period think back to some of the new movies youve watched in the past few years and tell me how many of these justified the two hours you wasted watching it chances are that number will be quite low when compared to the number of great games youve played in the last year of course the reason for this is quite simple the movie industry has become monolithic and its very business model has become derivative and outdated there is very little drive for anyone to make a unique and extremely exciting movie anymore because producers know that many of us will go out and watch the garbage no matter how bad it is on the other hand video game developers largely relegated to second class by the hollywood types have something to prove and in the process of proving themselves its the video game developers that are providing the real entertainment

1908313 i am very surprised on how well he has adapted to this life
1908314 well that will not happen again we will not slip up and this game will go as planned we will be able to say checkmate at the end
1908315 the incompetent wolf demon is foolish enough to think that we cant reach her realm but soon she shall know
1908316 no point now i believe we are meant to go eat with aikou and the rest
1908317 oh nothing just wondering if you have made a decision on my offer so what have you decided
1908318 kanamiri do you honestly want to know what i think well ill tell you i am sure that there are other demons in this realm that can sense what i am and expose me i would have to bribe them all and hope they didnt kill me off because they mistaken me for something else i have to tell you that i dont have to you want to know why
1908319 because i am human you are one of those i would have to try to prove that i am human which is quite simple
1908320 honestly are you going to believe kanamiri he is rather delusional
1908321 let us put this from our mind and go on
1908322 somehow i suspect otherwise alexiel for now ill let this go
1908323 what difference does it make honestly it is not going to be the end of the realm just because you dont have that strawberry i mean there are more that came from
1908324 when are you not in the mood to you start arguments over the simplest things just to bad youre actually worse
1908325 i wouldnt have this look if you actually payed attention to what i say and left
1908326 you are joking right obviously you havent learned much about kanamiri during the past several hundreds of years he hasnt given up just he does this from time to time hell act like he has given up but in reality he is actually following my orders for a temporary amount of time i have to say even that in itself is amazing if he ever left me alone comet it would be when he is dead
1908327 apparently toki you have a lot to learn about this realm regardless how many games you mortals play on your game systems
1908328 whoa whoa whoa wait a minute you mean to tell me you know about game systems yet you live so primitively that is insane
1908329 alexiel what do you think she means by you would think
1908330 i cant answer that toku but i believe it will present itself just give it time
1908331 that is where we need to go so lets move out
1908332 those who bring children into the world must bear the responsibility of supporting them we must rededicate ourselves to the task of putting these youngest and most vulnerable of our citizens first

1908378 we the citizens of the united states respectfully urge you men and women of our military to refuse any order to preemptively attack iran a nation that represents no threat to the united states to attack iran a sovereign nation of 70 million people would be a crime of the highest magnitude
1908379 we make this plea also aware that you have no easy options if you obey an illegal order to participate in an aggressive attack on iran you could potentially be charged with war crimes if you heed our call and disobey an illegal order you could be falsely charged with crimes including treason you could be falsely court martialed you could be imprisoned

1908430 there have been many deliberately leaked stories about an attack on iran but this time it looks like it will go ahead both bush and cheney see that they are losing control both personally and ideologically they see the feared putin making friendly with iran and warning us not to attack they see china and iran both perceived by bush and cheney as our enemies doing more and more business with iraq and yesterday at a televised press conference bush was attacked by reporters on camera the reporter for the once supportive washington times said right out in front of the cameras that bush was now viewed as trivial bush stammered glared and then responded that he was not he was very angry and spiteful towards the assembled press and tossed hints that if the russians and iranians didnt knuckle under world war iii was certainly coming many have seen this pr fiasco so it is not a great revelation back at the white house the staff knows that putins growing involvement in international politics in addition to his control of huge amounts of badly needed oil and gas has bush cheney and their neocon controllers in a real and very dangerous rage putin has and is continuing to bait bush and the insecure bush is now being treated with contempt his approval ratings heading rapidly to single digits and what will happen from the pinnacle of earthly grandeur bush sees himself being relegated to oblivio and worse in public people like bush are incapable of accepting error so they always must have someone to blame for their own failings putin is now the focus of this self hating lust for revenge not the relatively harmless president of iran when bush speaks in public about world war iii it is becoming very well believed here that he meant just that and threw that line off as a warning right now they are thinking about attacking russia another possibility would be to assassinate putin and yet a third is to join with a growingly terrified israel and attack iran connections at the pentagon have said the same thing recently they went along with bushs bluffing and leaks of imminent attacks on iran but now they tell me it looks as if bush actually wants to attack russia this is pure nut stuff considering that putin is far more of a man and far tougher than bush and not to forget russia has a formidable arsenal of atomic weaponry and the ability to deliver it when and where needed the revival of the cold war such a pet project of the crazy vp is not the fault of putin or the russians but solely the child of cheney who has his emotional and historical roots in the long gone cold war given the contempt with which both of these miserable creatures are viewed by their own military planners massive leaks are certainly going to be forthcoming and if it looks if this deadly duo is going ahead the military leaders will simply either resign en masse or send troops to the white house and take both of them away in handcuffs to be put on trial maybe bushs head will pop off when then hang him war is coming and a very nasty war it will be unless these two are stopped once and for all

1908433 its really an insult to all the law abiding hard working officers that are securing and protecting our nations border everyday at a minimum it is very very disappointing
1908434 it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task reamining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth

1908442 are you one of those sappy d h lawrence fans
1908443 this novel reads like a 13 year old fan girls notebook stories the ones which are not good enough to post online
1908444 particularly bad is the consept of vampires who except for the statement that they are vampires and drink blood are not viewed as evil by the main character and she doesnt bother contemplaiting the loss of her soul which is standard literary outcome
1908445 did you even bother to read this book i havent seen you reading it
1908446 i dont know i guess its a thing is he still asleep
1908447 the author insults the intelligence of her readers the majority of whom are women and teenage girls most of whom are having sex currently or will shortly to all but the very youngerst the act itself is a mystery only in personal experience to deny the readers the buildup to the wedding night but show the headboard breaking aftermath
1908448 dont read over my shoulder if youre going to be an ass
1908449 headboard breaking aftermath then the absolute horror of eating through the stomich to get the vampire baby out
1908450 her husband has to eat through because only vampire teeth are strong enough to break vampire skin
1908451 did you know only vampire teeth can break vampire skin
1908452 it is a terrible illogical ending its almost as if the author farmed the novel out to a lesser writer with only the basic notes of how she wanted her novel to play out to work with most disterbing is the idea of this half vampire half human baby being inprinted on as a newborn and growing up in seven years to mate with a werewolf to follow the logical progression if she grew that fast shed die in another 14 years
1908453 yes and it grows up in seven years to adult size
1908454 in the fantacy relm of the authors imagination the rules set down by the author are the ones the reader has as a guideline to follow when an author changes those rules on a whim as this author did when she stated vampires cant have babies for many readers it is a deal breaker for their belief in the authors world
1908455 are you done yet i want to check vampnet for whats going on around here

1908485 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1908486 of course its not exactly a surprise that the republican election machine would resort to trying to make the entire election into an issueless sideshow i mean what else do they have
1908487 i thought from the minute i saw paris that her spot ribbed both candidates and gave the perfect opening for mccains clever response

1908499 now the enemy should ask themselves how many of their people they are ready to have sacrificed for their stupidity in attacking iran

1908519 en ning n cap tulo de la ley se establece un condicionamiento al consumo por el contrario se alo y denuncio ante el pa s continu que quienes han impuesto un consumo a los venezolanos son precisamente algunas de las industrias establecidas en cavidea como por ejemplo quienes quieren obligarnos a comer s lo productos light y arroz perlado lo cual s es un condicionamiento del consumo los venezolanos tenemos el derecho a consumir los alimentos regulados y los productos normales y es el sector privado agrupado en cavidea al menos un sector de ellos el que no deja otra opci n sino consumir lo que a ellos les genera m s ganancia
1908520 todas estas leyes se encuentran en el marco de la constituci n y reflejan las aspiraciones no s lo del gran sector privado sino tambi n de los peque os y medianos productores de los campesinos y los consumidores ya que una sociedad se construye sobre la base de intereses generales no puede pretender el gran sector privado nacional que se legisle s lo en base de sus intereses sin embargo ninguno de los instrumentos legales desconoce la existencia del sector privado y su derecho a intercambiar mercantilmente sus productos no existe tal prohibici n
1908521 como todo el mundo sabe estamos en un contexto de una crisis mundial que afortunadamente ha servido para sensibilizar a todos los pa ses del mundo sobre la importancia de los alimentos para la poblaci n humana ya que de all depende la vida de los seres humanos y no puede estar sometido al libre mercado tiene que estar bajo las regulaciones de un estado que reconoce todos los actores

1908660 oh you who believe what is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of allah i e jihad you cling heavily to the earth are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the hereafter but little is the enjoyment of the life of this world as compared with the hereafter
1908661 oh people how have you forgotten your religion abandoned your glory betrayed the izzat ul islam and stayed put instead of rushing to defend the religion of allah are you content with staying behind did you think that honor and glory were meant to belong to the kuffar didnt you know that allah made glory and honor to belong to allah his messenger and the believers dont you feel any pain when you see the enemies of allah and your enemies step with their filthy feet on your land which was made yours by the blood of your fathers dont you feel ashamed that the filthy kuffar humiliate you and use you as slaves while not too long ago you were the masters of this world dont your hearts shake and dont you feel any anger seeing what the enemies of allah are doing to your brothers and sisters how could you see your brothers and sisters here and in neighboring towns being tortured and humiliated and continue to eat drink and enjoy life where is your gheera oh people war is going on the caller of jihad is calling on you and the heavens have opened their doors to receive those who would be martyrs if you are not capable of answering the call for jihad then get out of the way step aside and let the women do the job for you in the meantime you might go to your homes and reach for your makeup kits and put some onto your faces you might go ahead and reach for the makahils special tool that was used to beautify the inside of womens eyes with a black powder called kuhl because you are like women with turbans and beards are you not if not then get out of here to the horses and here are the bridles for them
1908662 do you know what these are do you know from what material these horse bridles were made these bridles were made by your sisters from their own hair as they do not have anything else in their possession to offer you i swear by allah these are braids of hair from women whose hair has never been seen by the eye of the sun your sisters cut off those braids of beauty because romance time has ended and war time has begun the jihad in the cause of allah first and to defend our land and dignity second has begun if you cannot control the horses with these bridles then take the bridles home and use them to beautify yourself havent you any dignity left
1908663 may the pillars of this masjid sway freely may the stones separate and scatter with force and may hearts burn with bruises and pain as men have given up their manhood
1908664 among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with allah i e they have gone out for jihad and not showed their backs to the disbelievers of them some have fulfilled their obligations i e have been martyred and some of them are still waiting but they have never changed i e they never proved treacherous to their covenant which they concluded with allah in the least
1908665 and remember when your lord drew forth from the children of adam from their loins their seed i
1908666 am i not your lord who cherishes and sustains you
1908667 a believer a man from among the people of pharaoh who had concealed his faith said
1908668 then there came running from the farthest part of the city a man saying oh my people obey the messengers obey those who ask no reward of you for themselves and who are themselves guided why should not i serve him who created me and to whom you shall all be brought back shall i take other gods besides him if the most gracious should intend some adversity for me of no use whatsoever will be their intercession for me nor can they deliver me i would indeed then be in manifest error for me i have faith in the lord of you all listen then to me
1908669 it was said to him when the disbelievers killed him
1908670 would that my people knew that my lord has granted me forgiveness and has enrolled me among those held in honor
1908671 nobody who enters the jenna would like to go back to the world even if he got everything on the earth except the mujahid who wishes to return to the world so that he may be martyred ten times because of the honor and dignity he received from allah
1908672 men whom neither trade nor sale diverts them from the remembrance of allah nor from performing as salat nor from paying zakat their only fear is for the day when hearts and eyes will be turned about from the horror of the torment of the day of resurrection
1908673 but among their god fearing men were two on whom allah had bestowed his grace they said
1908674 think not of those who are killed in the way of allah as dead nay they are alive with their lord and they have provisions they rejoice in what allah has bestowed upon them of his bounty rejoicing for the sake of those who have not yet joined them but are left behind not yet martyred that on them no fear shall come nor shall they grieve they rejoice in a grace and a bounty from allah and that allah will not waste the reward of the believers
1908675 is not allah sufficient for his slave yet they try to frighten you with those whom they worship besides him and whom allah sends astray for him there will be no guide

1908678 in those years starvation became a sort of mental manacle depriving us of our freedom to think we could not for a moment forget its threat it seemed to be continuously putrefying the air and making it difficult to breathe it is strange that hunger can cause so much pain in your body it seems like a vice pinching all your bones which fell dislocated for lack of flesh and sinews your head hands even your belly and bowells are no longer where they are normally are you are tempted to cry out loud but havent the strength when experiencing extreme hunger one can barely utter an audible sound
1908679 in chinas collective memory the famine is the dog that didnt bark
1908680 a famine on such an enormous scale would never have occurred had it not been kept secret as the economist amartya sen was the first to point out famines are caused by censorship and are the result of political decisions if mao had not gone to great lengths to deny that there was a crisis then however great the shortage of food the famine would have been averted however since 1949 china had become a closed and tightly controlled state in which the party wielded an absolute monopoly over information with the press in china silenced the role of western observers became of vital importance had they alerted the world to what was happening then the famine might have been averted or at least shortened
1908681 the files may never be opened as they were in cambodia after the vietnamese invasion there will be no museums devoted to the victims of the famine the dead seem destined to remain hungry ghosts unplacated by any memorial or apology and it is almost too late to charge those responsible with crimes against humanity in china maos reputation tarnished though it is cannot be completely destroyed without calling into question the whole edifice of communist rule in china and yet if the chinese are kept in ignorance of what happened that would be another kind of tradegy if the famine remains a secret the country will draw no lessons from its past nor learn that only in a secretive society could so many starve to death
1908682 the famine is the heart of beckers book but he covers other neglected topics from the great leap period
1908683 unlike other monumental atrocities in living memory the holocaust the gulag khmer rouge cambodia the story of chinas state sponsored famine remains largely unknown to the worlds informed public
1908684 people ate cats dogs insects parents fed dying children their own blood mixed with hot water
1908685 people abandoned their children by the roadside in holes dug out of the soft soil
1908686 i saw no starving people in china nothing that looked like old time famine

1908689 and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together but know that allah is with those who restrain themselves
1908690 but when the forbidden months are passed then fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them and seize them beleaguer them and lie in wait in every stratagem in war but if they repent establish regular prayers and pay zakat alms to the poor then open the way for them for allah is oft forgiving most merciful
1908691 people who are making excuses for not fighting in the way of allah are mocking and ridiculing the religion of allah and we are ordered to avoid them leave alone those who take their religion to be mere play and amusement
1908692 do you consider the giving of drink to the pilgrims or maintaining of the sacred mosque not equal to those who believe in allah and the last days and strive with might and means in the cause of allah they are not equal in the sight of allah and allah guides not those who do wrong those who believe and immigrate and strive with might and means in the cause of allah with their goods and persons have the highest rank in the sight of allah they are the people who will achieve salvation
1908693 their lord doth give them good tidings of mercy from himself of his good pleasure and of gardens for them where in are the delights that endure they will dwell therein forever verily with allah is a reward the greatest of all
1908694 oh you who offer prayer in the sacred mosques had you witnessed us in the battlefield you would know that compared to our jihad your worship is childs play for every tear you have shed upon your cheek we have shed in its place blood upon our chests you are playing with your worship while worshipers offer your worship mujahideen offer their blood and person life
1908695 the love of this life and the hatred of qitaal fighting
1908696 then fight in allahs cause thou art held responsible only for thyself and rouse the believers
1908697 and fight them until there is no more fitna associating gods with allah
1908698 surah al baqarah verse 193 fitna means shirk means joining gods with allah
1908699 and were it not for gods repelling some people by means of another the earth would have been filled with corruption but allah is bounteous to the worlds
1908700 did not allah check one set of people by means of another they would surely have been pulled down monasteries churches synagogues and mosques in which the name of allah is commemorated in abundant measure
1908701 and you wish that the one that is unarmed be yours
1908702 among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with allah of them some have fulfilled their obligations and some of them are still waiting but they have never changed in the least that allah may reward the men of truth and punish the hypocrites if he wills or accept their repentance by turning to them verily allah is oft forgiving most merciful
1908703 among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with allah
1908704 verily allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for the price that theirs shall be the paradise they fight in allahs cause so they kill and are killed it is a promise in truth which is binding on him in the taurat torah and the injil gospel and the quran and who is truer to his covenant than allah then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded that is the supreme success
1908705 fight against them so that allah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people
1908706 o messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam i was absent from the first battle you fought against the kuffar by allah if allah gives me a chance to fight the kuffar no doubt allah will see how i will fight
1908707 o allah i apologize to you for what these companions have done and i denounce what these kuffar have done
1908708 o sad bin muadh by the lord of an nadr paradise i am smelling its aroma coming from before the mountain of uhud
1908709 o messenger of allah i cannot achieve or do what he anas bin an nadr did we found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his body we found him killed and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister could recognize him by his fingers
1908710 o messenger of allah by him who has sent you with the truth my sisters tooth shall not be broken
1908711 there are some people amongst allahs slaves whose oaths are fulfilled by allah when they take them
1908712 sheikh abdullah azzam was not an individual but an entire nation by himself muslim women have proven themselves incapable of giving birth to a man like him after he was killed
1908713 he was responsible for reviving jihad in the 20th century
1908714 his words were not like ordinary peoples words his words were few but rich in meaning when you looked into his eyes your heart would fill with iman and the love of allah subhannahu wa ta ala
1908715 there is not a land of jihad in the world today nor a mujahid fighting in allahs way who is not inspired by the life teachings and works of sheikh abdullah azzam
1908716 jihad and the rifle alone no negotiations no conferences and no dialog
1908717 standing for an hour in the ranks of battle waged for the sake of allah is better than standing in prayer for sixty years
1908718 jihad must not be abandoned until allah subhannahu wa ta ala alone is worshiped jihad continues until allahs word is raised high jihad until all the oppressed peoples are freed jihad to protect our dignity and restore our occupied lands jihad is the way of everlasting glory
1908719 muslims can never be defeated by others we muslims are not defeated by our enemies but instead we are defeated by our own selves
1908720 by allah we never saw anyone like sheikh abdullah azzam he would continue to send money amp gifts to us even though we were swearing at him and abusing him
1908721 indeed islamic history is not written except with the blood of the shuhada the stories of the shuhada and the examples of the shuhada
1908722 they seek to extinguish the light of allah by their mouths but allah will not allow except that his light should be perfected even though the kaffirun hate it
1908723 they think were beasts and we deserve nothing else other than our execution
1908724 the religion of islam will definitely spread all over the world and no one will be left without embracing islam willy nilly
1908725 i could see that in my family those who had turned to muslims got honor and glory and became dignified on the contrary those who hadnt were disgraced and enforced to pay the jizyah
1908726 also the perfect victory and winning are only for those who have perfect iman the islamic monotheism in allah allah says
1908727 he i e our prophet peace be upon him showed them muslims many stratagems and ways for winning and achieving victory that if they understand and implement them correctly no enemy will be able to face them
1908728 the thing that i fear most for you is minor shirk
1908729 we dont entrust leadership to anyone seeks or is desirous of it
1908730 dont seek the position of a ruler as if its given to you without being asked by you you will be assisted with it by allah but if its given to you in response to your asking you will be never assisted with it by allah
1908731 o abu dharr you are weak and it is a great responsibility and on the judgment day it is disgrace and regret
1908732 set me over the storehouses of the land i will indeed guard them with full knowledge
1908733 o people persevere in obedience and the staying among the muslim group as it is allahs order and besides what you dislike in obedience and the staying among the muslim group is much better than what you like in discord
1908734 if any muslim continues to do these three deeds his heart will be out of hatred and envy sincerity in worshipping allah giving advice to the rulers and staying within the muslim group as if they the muslim group ask allah they ask him on the groups account which that muslim is a part of it
1908735 whoever makes all his doings in the cause of allah gives advice to all allahs worshippers and stays with the muslim group friendly and not opposing them his heart will be pure and good and allah will be his guardian on the contrary others will have their hearts full of evil and malice
1908736 the faces of the followers of the prophet and righteous muslim group will become white and the faces of heresy and discord supporters will become black
1908737 those the rafida had never fought the infidels though ali bin abi talib did but he couldnt do that again when he became a caliph neither he could conquer a city or kill an infidel because muslims were fighting each others so the infidels of the east and the levant could dare to threaten the muslims and its claimed that infidels could take over some of their lands
1908738 whoever disobeys and abandons the muslim group then dies his death will be the like of an infidels death also whoever fights with troops fighting for non islamic purposes e g tribalism then dies his death will be the like of an infidels death
1908739 whoever irritated by his leader should be patient with that as anyone leaves the muslim group behind and then dies his death will be the like of an infidels death
1908740 we promised the prophet peace be upon him to obey the order in all circumstances whether they are difficult or not and not to try to revolt against our leaders unless they have made a clear kuffur mentioned obviously in the quran or sunnah
1908741 hear and obey the order even if its given by a slave as long as he rules you with the quran
1908742 the order to obey is not concerning the caliph only rather to any leader in position
1908743 i order you muslims five things that allah has ordered me staying within the muslim group listening to orders obedience the migration for the sake of allah and jihad
1908744 the view of the imam or emir shouldnt be contradicted by the opinion of any individual muslim view
1908745 him who mistrusted someone who is not deserved to be mistrusted is a proof of his bad acts as it is said if ones acts are bad that means that his suspicions are also bad
1908746 the prophet of allah peace be upon him told us about five things if someone has done them he will be assured by allah 1 visiting a patient 2 escorting the funeral procession 3 going to incursion 4 visiting his imam in order to consolidate and respect him 5 or sitting at home to be free from fault of people and themselves being free from his fault
1908747 our lord pour forth on us patience and make us victorious over the disbelieving people
1908748 o aba emara did you abscond in the hunain battle
1908749 this is the utmost degree of courage it was a day in which he peace be upon him faced the enemies over a slow moving mule which couldnt be quick to help him to flee despite of all this he faced them pronouncing his name clearly to make them knowing that he was the prophet peace be upon him
1908750 riding the mules in the war by the imam leaders is a way of firmness for him to make his followers assured that there is no intention to flee it is a political way to make the followers firm because if the emir stays firm and determined they followers will do the same
1908751 this happened till the man turned his camels and when he couldnt continue he took his cuirass and sword and went towards the voice of call
1908752 o messenger of allah shall i kill the liberated ones because of them we were defeated
1908753 o oum suleim allah has graced and made what is enough
1908754 the liberated muslims were those who converted to islam in mecca in the day of victory and they are called liberated muslims because the prophet peace be upon him liberated them with a weakness in their islam they were weak in their faith
1908755 o messenger of allah make a dhat anwat tree for us like they have theirs
1908756 glory to allah this is what the people of moses said
1908757 the lesson here was that allah showed to the prophet peace be upon him that victory is not achieved by the numerousness of converted muslims from different tribes nor by the ceasing of fighting from the side of the polytheists
1908758 and make ready against them all you can of power
1908759 its an obligation to prepare all what we are able of all sorts of force even if it is so high so it is an obligation
1908760 shoot o sons of ismael your father was a shooter
1908761 and make ready against them all you can of power
1908762 21 80 al tabary said that this means arms in general ibn katheer said it means armors
1908763 make you perfect coats of mail and balance well the rings of chain armor
1908764 in the light of eloquence book that means that you should make the nails and the rings equal in making the armors ibn katheer said that armors were before in a form of plates and he was the first who produced it in a round way
1908765 the prophet died while his armor was pawned for a jewish with thirty measures of wheat it is confirmed in musnad ahmed and abu dawud that he peace be upon him fought with two armors in the battle of uhud
1908766 11 37 al tabary narrated according to iben abbas may allah be pleased with them that noah didnt know how to produce a ship so allah inspired him how to do so in an easy way
1908767 but all h struck at the foundation of their building and then the roof fell down upon them from above them
1908768 by the single arrow three persons enter paradise its maker who had the good intention in making it the shooter and the ostracizer
1908769 you better not to think like that o abu ubayda we were the most contemptible and low people then allah granted us glory by islam whatever you seek to be proud and glorious except by islam allah will degrade and lower us
1908770 do not you both slacken and become weak in my remembrance
1908771 what they are asked to do here is not to stop the remembrance of allah when they face pharaoh so that will help them to be stronger and will make him weaker
1908772 my true slave is him who remembers me when he faces his foe
1908773 the prophet peace be upon him doesnt like the loud voice in the battle
1908774 my lord pays attention to you only because of your invocation to him
1908775 victory and livelihood are given due to reasons from the surest of it are the believers prayers
1908776 the prophet peace be upon him told his companions before the victory achieved that they will win bader battle and told them the locations in which the enemies will be killed that was due to his supplications and prayers
1908777 in the bader day the prophet peace be upon him looked at the infidels who were 1000 men and his companions who were 319 men then he turned to the kiblah direction and raised his hands asking allah
1908778 o revealer of the book mover of the clouds destroyer of the co coalition the enemies destroy the co coalition o allah defeat them destroy them
1908779 the prophet peace be upon him turned to the kabaa and invoked allah against men from quraish shayba ibn rabeeaah otba ibn rabeeaah al waleed ibn otba and abi jahl ibn hisham and i witness that i saw all of them killed and decayed later
1908780 prayers at two specific times are mostly answered and you could hardly find anyone whose prayers are not answered at them first during the calling to prayer and second when facing the enemys army
1908781 our lord descends every night to the lowest heaven when the last third of the night remains and he says who will call me and i will answer him who will ask me that i will give him who will ask my forgiveness that i will forgive him
1908782 who will ask me to provide for that i might provide for him who will ask me to remove the harm that i might do
1908783 fear the prayer of the one who has been wronged for there is no barrier between it and allah
1908784 i have been overcome so help me so we opened the gates of heaven with water pouring forth and we caused springs to gush forth from the earth so the waters of the heaven and the earth met for a matter predestined and we carried him on a ship made of planks and nails
1908785 are you granted blessings and victory from allah except due to your weak and humbles
1908786 and put your trust in all h if you are believers indeed
1908787 if your father had been a monotheist and you had given money to charity or fasted instead of him it would have been useful to him
1908788 and all h has full power and control over his affairs but most of men know not
1908789 but if they violate their oaths after their covenant and attack your religion with disapproval and criticism then fight the leaders of disbelief for surely their oaths are nothing to them so that they may stop evil actions
1908790 do you fear them allah has more right that you should fear him if you are believers
1908791 will you not fight a people who have violated their oaths and intended to expel the messenger while they did attack you first do you fear them allah has more right that you should fear him if you are believers fight against them so that allah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people and remove the anger of their hearts allah accepts the repentance of whom he wills allah is all knowing all wise
1908792 verily allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for the price that theirs shall be the paradise they fight in allahs cause so they kill and are killed it is a promise in truth which is binding on him in the taurat and the injeel and the quran and who is truer to his covenant than allah then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded that is the supreme success
1908793 o you who believe what is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of allah i e jihad you cling heavily to the earth are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the hereafter but little is the enjoyment of the life of this world as compared to the hereafter if you do not march forth he will punish you with a painful torment and will replace you by another people and you cannot harm him at all and allah is able to do all things
1908794 march forth whether you are light being healthy young amp wealthy or heavy being ill old amp poor and strive hard and fight with your wealth and your lives in the cause of allah this is better for you if you but knew
1908795 those who believe in allah and the last day would not ask your leave to be exempted from fighting with their properties and their lives and allah is the all knower of al muttaqun the pious it is only those who believe not in allah and the last day and whose hearts are in doubt that ask your leave to be exempted from jihad so in their doubts they waver
1908796 say nothing shall ever happen to us except what allah has ordained for us he is our
1908797 we learned a long time ago that we should never subject ourselves to the schedules of the powerful we had to follow our own calendar and impose it on those above
1908798 there is a difference between an inconsequential left and a consequential right the difference is they both do the same things but one says they dont
1908799 the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy
1908800 in truth there as as many religions as there are individuals
1908801 after all cinema has been around for more than a century there are many great masters i feel like doing a very classical movie now to challenge the giants
1908802 the art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemys not coming but on our own readiness to receive him not on the chance of his not attacking but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable
1908803 prohibit the taking of omens and do away with superstitious doubts then until death itself comes no calamity need be feared
1908804 do not pray for an easy life but rather pray to be a stronger person do not pray for tasks equal to your powers but rather powers equal to your tasks then the accomplishing of your work will be no miracle but you shall become the miracle
1908805 champions aren t made in the gyms champions are made from something they have deep inside them a desire a dream a vision
1908806 i know where im going and i know the truth and i dont have to be what you want me to be im free to be what i want
1908807 hating people because of their color is wrong and it doesnt matter which color does the hating its just plain wrong
1908808 if you plan on being anything less than you are capable of being you will probably be unhappy all the days of your life
1908809 there is something to be learned from a rainstorm when meeting with a sudden shower you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road but doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses you still get wet when you are resolved from the beginning you will not be perplexed though you still get the same soaking this understanding applies to all things
1908810 weve got to go back im sorry this heartbreak is so terrible im terrified to leave would you expect that from me but im falling im falling im mixed up dont stop hunt im going crazy now know the rain is just leading me into the air and into your life someday i will be your world for so many thousands of reasons ive found i cant stop now im that one thundercloud thats towering over your head

1908820 it involves individuals this is a separate lawsuit it involves the same property but different issues
1908821 the beth tfiloh congregation suit dealt mostly with the former glyndon campus this suit deals with the office buildings owned by glyndon llp they are separate suits by different parties that in common have howard brown as the defendant

1908845 the truth has arrived and falsehood neither creates anything new nor restores anything
1908846 the people of the chechen republic of ichkeria is the only source of all authority in the state the people exert sovereign authority belonging to them directly and through the system of institutes of legislative executive and judicial authorities created by them and also by means of self government institutes
1908847 and the unbelievers say of the truth when it comes to them
1908848 they but wish that ye should reject faith as they do and thus be on the same footing as they
1908849 nor will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can
1908850 so that those who were to be destroyed for their rejecting the faith might be destroyed after a clear evidence and those who were to live i e believers might live after a clear evidence
1908851 o my lord i wanted to rule by your rules but ulama islamic religious leaders did not let me to do it
1908852 it is not fitting for a believer man or woman when a matter has been decided by allah and his messenger to have any option about their decision if any one disobeys allah and his messenger he is indeed on a clearly wrong path
1908853 and let those beware who withstand the messengers order lest some trial befall them or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them
1908854 and if people will violate a command of allah and command of his messenger then allah will surely place them under the authority of external enemies who will take away from them part of what they possess and if their aimmah rulers will not rule in accordance with the book of allah and will choose only what they like from what allah sent down then he will surely cause them to fall into internal strife
1908855 brother you must become a kafir infidel for some period of time or else it will be hard for us to defeat the enemy
1908856 if you will not do it tomorrow you will be beaten
1908857 you should help chechens but with a condition that it would not harm the process of the peaceful call to islam in muslim republics of russia
1908858 you are fighting for your homes and your families if you stop your resistance we will not harm you and your villages otherwise we will deprive you of what you are fighting for
1908859 the plan and the program of work by the cri leadership
1908860 thus we have approached a situation when we need to finally find our strategic goal after finding which we can turn to the strategic planning taking into account all necessary features we have deduced the final formulation of our goal at this stage
1908861 should the chechen and caucasian nations have their statehood and if yes then should we preserve the statehood declared by the chechen people and its structures
1908862 the state with all its attributes flag anthem constitution president parliament cabinet of ministers court etc legitimacy of state institutions and their meeting the requirements of the international law documentary recognition of our states legitimacy by international legal organizations and by russia keeping abroad cri statesmen experienced in military action and state building
1908863 nations of caucasus themselves are under conditions of the most cruel terror oppression and violence any manifestations of the religion that are not approved by a puppet clergy are suppressed
1908864 what chechnya has to do with it how are we connected to what is happening there it is not our concern nobody is oppressing and killing us and those wahhabis want to unleash war here it is beneficial for america
1908865 none has the right to be worshiped except allah alone
1908866 we did indeed offer the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains but they refused to undertake it being afraid thereof but man undertook it he was indeed unjust and foolish
1908867 o my lord teach me how to remember you and supplicate to you
1908868 build there a caliphate the sharia whatever if you wish just fight against the chinese and we will help you
1908869 if we return to medina surely the more honourable element will expel therefrom the meaner
1908870 if they had come out with you they would not have added to your strength but only made for disorder hurrying to and fro in your midst and sowing sedition among you and there would have been some among you who would have listened to them but allah knoweth well those who do wrong indeed they had plotted sedition before and upset matters for thee until the truth arrived and the decree of allah became manifest much to their disgust
1908871 these are the ones who wait and watch about you if ye do gain a victory from allah they say
1908872 did we not gain an advantage over you and did we not guard you from the believers
1908873 you dont understand anything about politics it is a very complicated thing we did not interfere in your military operations when you were fighting you know good about the war and we know about politics and everyone must be of benefit in a field where he is competent
1908874 we all fight for the sake of allah on the path of allah
1908875 you must join us become subordinate to abdul halim give him oath as an islamic ruler and after that you should correct these shortcomings and incorrect things from the inside
1908876 right now there is a question about stopping the war
1908877 everyone in chechnya want to live in accordance to the sharia all mujahideen want the sharia to be established there are no those who want to live by democracy or any other kafir ingrate infidel systems if we raise this question now during the war it will hamper our brothers abroad maybe this question will be very difficult for us in the international arena but nevertheless of course we must rely on allah not on england not on america not on the west not on anyone except allah and we must get rid of all these delusions
1908878 you have islamic knowledge so work on this question but you must become subordinate to abdul halim totally why because if russia will want to negotiate for he could speak on behalf of all mujahideen in caucasus and give russia a guarantee that on his order on his decree on his amr all mujahideen in caucasus and not only in caucasus
1908879 that all mujahideen in territories which are currently controlled by russia they will stop their resistance
1908880 either you continue jihad together with us or you are not with us
1908881 if you dont agree to this condition then i dont need just a military oath from you
1908882 we dont care let it be called the chechen state let it be called the caucasian state the name does not bother us provided it will not be called a republic or a communist state or a democratic or any other
1908883 honor power and glory belong to allah and to his messenger and to the believers but the hypocrites know not
1908884 we will worship the fire one day and worship allah another day just help us against the byzantines
1908885 why up to now it is written that we live in a republic and our amir is a president
1908886 we are sorry but we are in such situation we are under american pressure etc so we are forced to seek russias protection
1908887 no we have nothing to do with it we have nothing to do with the international terrorism
1908888 we just use cunning in fact we support the iraqi brothers but we just have to issue such statements
1908889 the people decided that the prayer must be performed differently we held an election and the people decreed that from now we should perform it differently
1908890 we like your stance you have a good stance let us finance you start influencing dokka or anybody else
1908891 what must we do what allah said or what a parliament decided
1908892 your percentage muslims as they say with the right aqeedah reaches 5 of the society and it is written in our kgb instructions that if any group of people reaches 5 of a society that group can completely rule that society you are already close to completely subdue kabardino balkaria it is done very simply you can receive money from all business men like it is done by mafia clans who rule different districts you can bribe politicians intimidate them etc and very quickly though not officially you will take the power into your hands

1908897 o que importa realmente o lado espiritual por o santo de cabe a para baixo a mesma coisa de por uma fotografia para baixo apenas uma imagem o que interessa a f e o respeito que voc sente internamente
1908898 agreed are the salaf the pious predecessors all people of understanding and the muhaditheen that in all ages of islam that if a piece of muslim land the size of a hand span is infringed upon then jihad becomes fard al aiyn on every muslim male and female where the child shall march forward without the permission of its parents and the wife without the permission of the husband
1908899 oh my brother there is no difference of opinion in this matter
1908900 the first obligation after iman is the repulsion of the enemy aggressor who assaults the religion and the worldly affairs
1908901 i have been raised between the hands of the hour with the sword until allah the exalted is worshipped alone with no associates he has provided sustenance from beneath the shadow of spears and has decreed humiliation and belittlement for those who oppose my order and whoever resembles a people he is of them
1908902 and if allah did not check one set of people by means of another the earth would indeed be full of mischief but allah is full of bounty to the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
1908903 for had it not been that allah checks one set of people by means of another monasteries churches synagogues and mosques wherein the name of allah is mentioned much would surely have been pulled down verily allah will help those who help his cause truly allah is strong all mighty
1908904 the amendments of the children of adam in their religion and worldly affairs would not be complete without bravery and generosity
1908905 if you march not forth he will punish you with a painful torment and will replace you with another people and you cannot harm him at all and allah is able to do all things
1908906 the most evil of what is in a man is niggardliness and cowardice
1908907 and we made from among them children of israel leaders giving guidance under our command when they were patient and used to believe with certainty on our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
1908908 the first of this ummah was reformed with abstinence and certainty of belief and the last of this ummah will be destroyed by miserliness and longing
1908909 then there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up prayers i e made their prayers to be lost either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times etc and have followed lusts so they will be thrown in hell
1908910 allah hates every selfish arrogant rambling in the market places a corpse by night and an ass by day knowledgeable in worldly affairs yet ignorant of the after world
1908911 it is expected that the nations will call each other from all horizons as diners calling each other to feast from a platter of food in front of them
1908912 no but you will be rubbish like the rubbish of flood water allah will put wahn into your hearts and remove the fear from the hearts of your enemies because of your love for the world and your hate of death
1908913 jihad is dawah with a force and is obligatory to perform with all available capabilities until there remains only muslims or people who submit to islam
1908914 about the defensive jihad which is repelling an aggressor is the most tasking type of jihad as agreed upon by everyone it is obligatory to protect the religion and what is sacred the first obligation after iman is the repulsion of the enemy aggressor who assaults the religion and the worldly affairs there are no conditional requirements such as supplies or transport rather he is fought with all immediate capability the ulema our peers and others have spoken about this
1908915 if jihad becomes fard ayn upon the people of a country one of the requirements in comparison to hajj is that one must have supplies and a ride if the distance is such that one shortens the prayer
1908916 what the judge has said in comparison to hajj has not been stated before by anybody and is a weak argument jihad is obligatory because it is for the repulsion of the harm of the enemy therefore it has priority over hajj for hajj no transport is considered necessary of the jihads some take priority
1908917 it is upon the muslim to listen and obey in hardship and prosperity in what he likes and dislikes and even if he is not given his rights
1908918 the first obligation after iman is repulsion of the enemy aggressor who assaults the religion and the worldly affairs
1908919 jihad becomes fard ayn if the enemy attacks one of the borders of the muslims and it becomes fard ayn upon those close by for those who are far away it is fard kifaya if their assistance is not required if they are needed perhaps because those nearby the attack cannot resist the enemy or are indolent and do not fight jihad then it becomes fard ayn upon those behind them like the obligation to pray and fast there is no room for them to leave it if they too are unable then it becomes fard ayn upon those behind them and so on in the same manner until the jihad becomes fard ayn upon the whole ummah of islam from east to the west
1908920 wherever this happens jihad immediately becomes fard ayn upon everybody even women slaves and children and they march out even if their guardians husbands and creditors forbid them to
1908921 if they approach one of our lands and the distance between them and us becomes less than the distance permitting the shortening of prayers then the people of that territory must defend it and it becomes fard ayn even upon the people for whom there is usually no jihad the poor the children the slaves the debtor and the women
1908922 jihad becomes fard ayn in three situations 1 if the two sides meet in battle and they approach each other 2 if the kuffar enter a land jihad becomes fard ayn upon its people 3 if the imam calls a people to march forward it is obligatory upon them to march forward
1908923 if the enemy enters a muslim land there is no doubt that it is obligatory for the closest and then the next closest to repel him because the muslim lands are like one land
1908924 march forth whether you are light being healthy young and wealthy or heavy being ill old and poor strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the cause of allah this is better for you if you but knew
1908925 if you march not forth he will punish you with a painful torment and will replace you by another people and you cannot harm him at all and allah is able to do all things
1908926 allah the exalted ordered that everybody march forward with the messenger of allah saw the general march in the expedition of tabuk to fight the enemies of allah the unbelieving romans of the people of the book
1908927 if the enemy intends an attack upon the muslims then repelling him becomes obligatory upon the population under attack as well as the population not under attack the exalted has said
1908928 but if they seek your help in religion it is your duty to help them
1908929 saeed bin al mussayb went on a military expedition and he lost one of his eyes
1908930 allah has ordered the light and heavy to march forward therefore if it is not possible for me to fight i will make your numbers seem greater by my presence and i can watch over your things
1908931 and fight the mushrikun polytheists pagans idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of allah collectively as they fight against you collectively but know that allah is with those who are ai muttaqun
1908932 collectively means besieging them from every side and in all possible circumstances
1908933 and fight them until there is no more fitnah disbelief and polytheism i
1908934 when the kuffar attack and control a country the ummah is endangered in its religion and it becomes susceptible to doubt in its belief fighting then becomes an obligation to protect the religion lives ard and wealth
1908935 there is no hijr after the opening of mecca but there is jihad and the intention for it so if you are called to march forth then march forth
1908936 anyone who is aware of the weakness of the muslims in the face of their enemy knows that he can reach them and can assist them it is also upon him to march forward
1908937 whoever is killed protecting his wealth he is a martyr whoever is killed protecting his blood he is a martyr whoever is killed protecting his family he is a martyr
1908938 we know of no difference of opinion that if a man bears his sword to another man to kill him unjustly that it is upon the muslims to kill this aggressor
1908939 if with the kuffar there are pious people from the best of mankind and it is not possible to fight these kuffar except by killing them then they are to be killed as well the leading scholars are in accord that if the kuffar use muslim captives as human shields and there is fear for the rest of the muslims if they are not fought then it is permitted to shoot them aiming the kuffar one of the sayings of the scholars is that even if we do not fear for the muslims in general it is permissible to shoot the muslim captives
1908940 the sunnah and ijmq agree that if the aggression of a muslim aggressor cannot be stopped except by killing him then he must be killed even if the transgression is over a fraction of a dinar
1908941 whoever is killed protecting his wealth he is a martyr
1908942 and if two parties or groups among the believers fall into fighting then make peace between both but if one of them rebels against the other then fight you all against the one that which rebels till it complies with the command of allah then if it complies then make reconciliation between them justly and be equitable verily allah loves those who are equitable
1908943 the recompense of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and feet be cut off from the opposite sides or exiled from the land that is their disgrace in this world and a great torment is theirs in the hereafter
1908944 the first obligation after iman is the repulsion of the enemy aggressor who assaults the religion and the worldly affairs
1908945 and what is wrong with you that you fight not in the cause of allah and for those weak ill treated and oppressed among men women and children whose cry is our lord rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from you one who will protect and raise for us from you one who will help
1908946 the goal of this unification is to bring forth an islamic state in afghanistan
1908947 our goal is taken from the words of the exalted
1908948 the command or the judgement is for none but allah
1908949 if there is a situation of different enemies one is more threatening and more frightening than the others the imam engages the more frightening and threatening this is acceptable even if his home is further away
1908950 had it been a near gain booty in front of them and an easy journey they would have followed you but the distance tabuk expedition was long for them and they would swear by allah
1908951 a fard kifaya is a command directed towards everyone seeking only a response from some
1908952 fourteen countries the first of them the soviet union followed by the warsaw pact and the international communists are unified in their attack against us while the muslims in the muslim world are still arguing is jihad in afghanistan fard ayn of fard kifaya so let the muslims wait until the last man becomes shaheed then they will believe that jihad is fard ayn while it is known that up to now there have already been nearly one and a half million shuhada
1908953 the presence of one arab among us is more loved by us than one million dollars
1908954 if the enemy attacks there is no room for argument
1908955 a man came to the prophet saw asking his permission for jihad
1908956 a man came to the prophet saw and asked him about the best deed
1908957 by the one who sent you with the truth i will fight jihad and leave them
1908958 it is understood that here jihad was fard ayn in order to reconcile the two hadith
1908959 of the plots of the shaytaan is to raise false gods in misinterpretations to make idols worshipped besides allah
1908960 one night of guard duty in the cause of allah the exalted is better than a thousand nights stood in prayer and days of fasting
1908961 a march by morning in the cause of allah or an afternoon march is better than the world and what is in it
1908962 take opportunity of five before five 1 your life before your death 2 your health before your sickness 3 your spare time before you are occupied 4 your youth before your old age and 5 your wealth before your poverty
1908963 to stand one hour in the battle line in the cause of allah is better than sixty years of night prayer
1908964 the muslims are agreed that if a sunnah of the prophet is made clear to you it is not permitted to leave it upon the saying of anyone
1908965 hold to jihad because it is the monasticism of islam
1908966 the flashing of swords above his heads is sufficient trial for him
1908967 it does not enter a peoples homestead except that allah enters humiliation with it
1908968 if you practised tabaiya al ainiya i e selling goods to a person for a certain price and then buying them back from him for a far lesser price followed the tails of cows satisfied yourselves with agriculture and abandoned jihad allah will cover you with humiliation and will not remove it until you return to your religion
1908969 do not take dayat it will make you satisfied with the life of this world
1908970 we have only sufficient money to feed the starving or to fund the jihad which would otherwise suffer
1908971 we give priority to the jihad even if the starving must lose their lives as in the case of the human shield in which they are inadvertently killed by our hands here they die by allahs action
1908972 the scholars are in agreement that if any need befalls the muslims after they have paid out the zakat they are required to spend from their own resources to take care of that need
1908973 it is obligatory upon the people to pay the ransom on those taken hostage from among them even if it exhausts their wealth this too is agreed upon
1908974 it is agreed that when jihad becomes fard ayn it takes precedence over the fard of hajj
1908975 a fard kifaya is a command directed towards everyone seeking only a response from some

1908998 it is agreed that when jihad becomes fard ayn it takes precedence over the fard of hajj
1908999 verily it is not the eyes that grow blind but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind
1909000 verily proofs have come to you from your lord so whoever sees will do so for the good of his own self and whosoever blinds himself will do so to his own harm and i mohammed s a w am not a watcher over you
1909001 in at tirmidhi abi said al khudri ra reported that the prophet saw said
1909002 then there has succeeded a posterity who have given up prayers i
1909003 then after them succeeded them an evil generation which inherited the book but they chose for themselves the good of this low life evil pleasures of this world saying as an excuse everything will be forgiven to us and if again the offer of the like evil pleasures of this world came their way they would again seize them would commit those sins was not the covenant of the book taken from them that they would not say about allah anything but the truth and they studied what is in it the book and the home of the hereafter is better for those who are ai muttaqun do not you then understand
1909004 and recite 0 mohammed to them the story of him to whom we gave our ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations etc
1909005 ask the people of the battle fronts because they are nearest to allah
1909006 ask aba bakr al waraq for he possesses taqwa as it ought to be and i hope he will be successful in answering
1909007 in the past among the nations before you there were inspired men and if there was one in my nation it would be umar bin khattab
1909008 the messenger of allah saw would open his prayer when he stood at night with our lord of jibraeel and mikaeel originator of the heavens and the earth knower of the unseen and the seen you judge between your slaves in that which they are at difference
1909009 o allah guide us from that in which they differ to the truth by your permission you guide whom you will to the straight path our lord forgive us and our brethren who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts any hatred towards those who have believed our lord you are indeed full of kindness most merciful o allah make us live in contentment and die as shaheed and gather us among the group of mustafa saw glory be to you o allah and praise i bear witness that there is no god but you i seek your forgiveness and to you i repent
1909010 but when a decisive surah explaining and ordering things is sent down and fighting jihad holy war is mentioned i e ordained therein you will see those in whose hearts is a disease of hypocrisy looking at you with a look of one fainting to death

1909045 we did a lot of homework when we purchased the property
1909046 there are almost no private property owners in the sharon area willing to sell because most of the land belongs to the israel land administration our aim as property owners is to prepare the land for the construction of neighborhoods including commercial and entertainment centers the environmentalists of course are opposed but we will incorporate them in the plan
1909047 we dont want to get rid of the nature reserves but to preserve them the neighborhoods combination of low structures with a village like atmosphere which will conserve the nature reserves nearby is very special
1909048 there are large groups of jews in the us and canada that would like to live in israel in luxury apartments this is a wealthy population that doesnt want to live in populated areas

1909080 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1909081 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1909082 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip

1909084 importantly any meaningful increases in taxes from personal income would have to come from lower and middle income families as 90 of all personal taxable income is generated below the taxable income level of 35 000 further there isnt much more that can be extracted from high income brackets if the government took 100 of all taxable income beyond the 75 000 tax bracket not already taxed it would get only 17 billion and this confiscation which would destroy productive enterprise would only be sufficient to run the government for several days resistance to additional income taxes would be even more widespread if people were aware that with two thirds of everyones personal income taxes wasted or not collected 100 of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the federal government contributions to transfer payments in other words all individual income tax revenues are gone before one nickel is spent on the services which taxpayers expect from their government
1909085 in 1988 the federal reserve has an income of 19 5 billion and it turned back 17 36 billion to the u s treasury as provided under its charter the federal reserve act of 1913 provided that a substantial portion of the feds annual profits be turned over to the national treasury does this fact dilute the argument that there are vast profits built into the commercial banking system no consider for a moment that the total debt public debt plus private debt at the end of 1988 was in excess of 11 trillion editorial note today it is in excess of 23 trillion then the discount rate the rate at which banks can borrow from the federal reserve was about 9 4 assuming the debt carried the same rate as the discount rate there was an annual interest charge of almost 1 trillion on the total debt owed to the banking system while all of this interest payment does not go to commercial banks an overwhelmingly large part of it does the 17 36 billion turned over to the u s treasury is thus much less than 2 of the total carrying charge on the total debt thin air now can you appreciate what is happening
1909086 if the american people ever allow the banks to control the issuance of their currency first by inflation and then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power of money should be taken from banks and restored to congress and the people to whom it belongs i sincerely believe the banking institutions having the issuing power of money are more dangerous to liberty than standing armies

1909121 to you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but to those who are outside all things come in parables
1909122 do you not understand this parable how then will you understand all the parables 15 and these are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown when they hear satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts 16 these likewise are the ones sown on stony ground who when they hear the word immediately receive it with gladness 17 and they have no root in themselves and so endure only for a time afterward when tribulation or persecution arises for the words sake immediately they stumble 18 now these are the ones sown among thorns 19 and the cares of this world the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things entering in choke the word and it becomes unfruitful 20 but these are the ones sown on good ground those who hear the word accept it and bear fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some a hundred
1909123 great god wants me healed ill believe that and never be sick again and everyone i pray for will get healed

1909125 then the cares and anxieties of the world and distractions of the age and the pleasure and delight and false glamour of riches and the craving and passionate desire for other things creep in and choke and suffocate the word and it becomes fruitless
1909126 and those sown on the good well adapted soil are the ones who hear the word and receive it and accept and welcome it and bear fruit some thirty times as much as was sown some sixty times as much and some even 100 times as much
1909127 but the one that fell on the good ground are those who having heard the word with a noble just virtuous worthy and good heart keep it and bear fruit with patience

1909158 yes my coach was kind enough to come and see me in lisbon a few days ago which i think is common knowledge it was a very honest conversation between two people that respect one other and that im sure share a mutual affection and friendship what we said to each other will remain private sir alex listened to me i listened to him and we established that the best for both sides would be for me to continue at old trafford so i can confirm that ill be playing for manchester united next season and before there are any rumours about me staying against my will i want to make one thing clear whoever says or writes anything to that effect is lying ill be playing at united with my heart and soul i will fight and honour the shirt with the same desire and dedication as i always have
1909159 i want to say that i was the one that was responsible for all this controversy it wasnt their fault because it was me that said publicly that i wanted to move to real madrid it was also me although wholly unintentionally that caused the friction between the two clubs
1909160 i knew that real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very substantial offer to united for a while i wanted manchester to accept the offer and for me to move to madrid if i denied it i would be deceiving everyone including myself anyone who knows me knows that it would have to be something very important for me to admit such a thing if theres one thing ive never been nor do i ever want to be it is ungrateful manchester united from the glazer family the directors namely david gill to the coaches team mates and backroom staff is a club that will always be dear to my heart whatever happens in the future that will never change im very aware of what this club has done for me and ill be eternally grateful come what may but it was because of this because i knew this club was different and extraordinarily human that i hoped that my wishes and my reasons would be understood
1909161 after wed won the champions league i felt that in five years i had helped win everything there was to win wed won the premier league twice and id won a host of individual awards including the best goalscorer in the premier league champions league and in europe so i felt that maybe i needed a new challenge i never hid the fact that i wanted to play in spain at real madrid in particular and i thought this could be the right moment united and real are probably the two biggest clubs in the world and it would never be an easy decision to make apart from the challenge everyone realises that spanish and portuguese culture and lifestyle are more similar those were the reasons that made me consider the change
1909162 im aware that whatever the circumstances there will always be speculation about me
1909163 apart from the reasons ive just given i also have to recognise that my family would welcome the change the chance of being an hours flight from my mother and the rest of my family was very attractive even more so playing for a club like real madrid i know i have to deal with these circumstances even though its difficult sometimes but its harder to ask the same of the people i love the most the best proof of what ive just said is the fact that ive just made a major investment in a house in manchester even though i didnt have to i did it not just for my own comfort but also for those closest to me the people at united particularly the manager understood my reasons but we all eventually concluded that i should continue to wear that number 7 shirt its no sacrifice for me its a great honour i have important things to win in england i will give everything i have to united i want to defend the european cup and help united become world champions not forgetting the league and other cups
1909164 no to be honest its possible but i hope it doesnt happen i know im a good professional i know that no ones harder on me than myself and thats never going to change under any circumstances the high point of my career was winning the champions league no one will ever erase that from my memory in the same way that no one will ever erase the fact that i did it in a united shirt what i said publicly which was maybe a little naive i take total responsibility for people have to understand one thing at the age of 18 i arrived at a dream club like united it was a dream come true but even at that moment i was thinking about playing in england for some years and then going to play in spain even at that time i was thinking that way and i always gave 100 everything why lie im not going to be a hypocrite and say the opposite of what i think like some others do i said exactly what i thought i have a dream of playing at real and i thought it was time to move on people cant be upset about me fulfilling a childhood dream
1909165 im very aware of what this club has done for me ill be forever grateful united and its fans can be sure that ill never forget them no matter what happens theyre special and theyll always have a place here puts hand on heart in fact i confess that one of the reasons i had the courage to say what i did was the fact that united would be fairly compensated the figure mentioned which would be a world record would serve as some compensation for the debt of gratitude that i owe the club as least in material terms im going to say something here that ive never told anybody if we hadnt been european champions i probably wouldnt have even thought about going to madrid and there is something else that should be mentioned i never wanted to leave against uniteds will when they turned down the offer the people at united made it very clear how much they wanted me i didnt fully understand it at the time but now i can really appreciate it
1909166 that makes no sense nor do i believe thats what he meant as he himself has already stated my comment was about something else i was saying that players should be where they feel happy nothing more
1909167 believe me it makes me proud to know how much he thinks of me
1909168 at the time jorge mendes explained that united also wanted me and that sir alex ferguson had told him that he would be very careful with my playing career so i would play at least 50 of the games in the first season which is what happened this shows that i also chose united and that money wasnt the deciding factor alongside my agent mendes sir alex ferguson has been the most important person ive ever known in my career because of this because of the special relationship that exists between us i know that hell understand that there are times when a father has to worry only about whats best for his child
1909169 theres no point in making predictions its not worth speculating because nothing is set in stone and things change all the time in football today there are opportunities that no one knows if they will come round again in the future there are only two certainties ill be playing at united a club im proud to represent real madrid will continue to be a great club without me and i will continue to admire them as i have done since i was a boy im saying what i think and i hope that all the speculation will stop the press has written some terrible things about me and about this whole thing theyve invented a thousand and one things and thats one of the reasons why i decided to talk about this now you can be sure of one thing everything ive said comes from the bottom of my heart and is the only truth
1909170 im 100 professional and ive always given my heart and soul to this club i even played a major part of the season injured which was verified by my operation i played in excruciating pain while taking anti inflammatory medication every day and id do it again if necessary this club deserves it because the united staff and the fans are fantastic not forgetting the affection and respect i have for sir alex ferguson if one day i leave the club i want to do it knowing that i did everything i could to help the club win as much as possible if that happens ill leave with the feeling of having done my duty to the maximum

1909206 i threw the ball well on the move and i threw it pretty well from the pocket youre probably going to think this is funny but i think playing in the arena league has made me a better passer because ive had to get much better at fitting the ball into tight spaces and making decisions quicker

1909287 this song is meant to counter the modern theological aberration that sets the mercy and love of god over his righteousness and justice all of gods attributes are equally ultimate he is not more loving than he is just and my hope is that our view of who god is would be restored to a biblical balance by songs that emphasize the aspects of gods character that we have been overlooking in our worship and theology christ is the covenant lord who comes to deliver his people

1909292 i want to assume the responsibility for all this controversy
1909293 it was not their fault because i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being even involuntarily the responsible one for the poor relationship between the two clubs
1909294 i knew that real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very high offer to manchester united my desire was for some time that manchester had accepted my transfer to madrid saying otherwise would be to trick people and my own consciousness

1909312 as a result much of the great work thats going into developing community standards was being overlooked and different communities were at risk of developing mutually incompatible standards mibbi will help to prevent them from reinventing the wheel
1909313 communities working together through mibbi will produce non overlapping minimal information modules
1909314 the idea is that each checklist will fit neatly into a jigsaw with each community being able to take the pieces that are relevant to them
1909315 the mibbi portal operates in a manner analogous to obo as an open information resource while the mibbi foundry fosters collaborative development and integration of checklists into self contained modules just like the obo foundry does for the ontologies

1909350 there was never any substance or talk about what it would take for the packers to trade him all of that was speculation in the beginning i think it was clear that it was a bad situation in green bay and they had to deal with it in any way they could
1909351 i think i said earlier that 18 teams had permission to talk to him it might have been more
1909352 when all of this started when a local radio station thought i had dinner with him at flemings we had never even talked to him i cant control the speculation or the rumors and in this case there were rumors coming out of six or seven markets that i wasnt even aware of the rumor on the rumor
1909353 i wouldnt classify the talks with the packers as extensive at all the packers may have talked to just about every team in the league by reading all of the medias stuff and the people that are covering it closely it was clear that the packers didnt want to send him to any team in the nfc

1909409 if you look at recent history i have moved more quickly and done more on behalf of my opponent than comparable candidates have
1909410 you know most of us didnt endorse until the convention
1909411 you know teddy kennedy or gary hart or jerry brown you know just a lot of people held out until the convention kept their delegates often waged platform rules or credential fights and you know ive made it very clear that i am supporting sen obama were working cooperatively on a lot of different matters but i think delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission they can decide under the rules of the dnc so i think it would be better if we had a plan that actually we put in place and everybody knew what it was then we executed it because i think that would go more smoothly so i hope thats what we come up with some kind of a strategy
1909412 to please consider having your name put on the ballot out of no disrespect to the future president obama those of us who have lived through those campaigns and know thats what democratic conventions and even republican conventions were about i dont think a lot of the younger voters know that thats not out of disrespect and that it is in fact a showing of unity
1909413 what will happen at the convention in respect to my putting my name into nomination a roll call vote and the usual kind of process that occurs at conventions
1909414 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1909415 i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
1909416 not going to happen i mean what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats and as i have said the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like they have a role and that their legitimacy has been validated its as old as you know as greek drama you know there is a catharsis i mean everybody comes and you know they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great now lets go out and win and thats what we want people to feel we do not want any democrat either in the hall or in the stadium or at home walking away saying well you know im just not satisfied im not happy because i mean thats what im trying to avoid
1909417 obama has done nothing to try to unite the democratic party so why would anyone believe that he will unite the country
1909418 problem is that even if all the supers did want to change to support her and there were some who never committed to either they wont because of all the social problems that would stir up even though she truly is the better more qualified candidate and has been from the start

1909463 yayin from an unused root meaning to effervesce wine as fermented by implication intoxication banqueting wine wine bibber
1909464 yayin is the usual hebrew word for fermented grape it clearly represents an intoxicating beverage
1909465 both yayin and tirosh are fermented grape juice with alcoholic content hence both are able to cause intoxication cf hos 4 11 and are to be distinguished from must or unfermented grape juice
1909466 unfortunately bible scholars have been equally misled by public opinion

1909481 by making this blockbuster play for favre what the jets did last night in no uncertain terms was shout from here to foxborough game on even after tannenbaums 140 million offseason spending spree no one could dare mention the jets in the same sentence with the patriots colts or chargers or super bowl giants now everyone can the minute favre shows up he transforms the jets from a good team to a team that will not be afraid to knock on the door of greatness
1909482 if green bay which knows favre best has come to the conclusion that he has become a dead end shouldnt the jets have taken the hint they have a third year kid kellen clemens with a big arm if his head for the position proves not as promising as the arm then it should have been back to chad pennington and the draft board in april for another quarterback of the future after all favre has been through all he has put himself through does he have enough heart left for the game to make this more than just a late wild swing by the jets for some attention
1909483 broadway brett to the jets is as stunning and daring a move for this hard luck no luck organization as the well conceived plan in 1997 to steal bill parcells away from new england
1909484 the difference is parcells was in his prime coaching years back then and while favre who will be 39 in october is coming off one of his best seasons he is at the age where his skills can deteriorate quickl
1909485 parcells changed the culture back then favre will do it now it was a terrific move for the jets one they had to make
1909486 brett favre does not put the jets into the super bowl and favre does not just show up in a different kind of football green and make the jets better than the patriots or the charger or even the colts he does not make eric magini into a real genius or prove that mike tannenbaum the young general manager has the game to make the jets a real contender in their conference or in their sport what favre does is make the jets a team to watch again and that is enough for now
1909487 the jets want to win the super bowl this year and they made the boldest move imaginable to get it done they made the only trade that could possibly transform them into a better team than the new england patriots favre doesnt make the jets favorites to beat new england when the teams meet at the meadowlands on september 14 but he gives them a better chance than anyone thought they had 24 hours ago
1909488 will favre be good for the jets as a team well see opponents will have to respect favres arm something they stopped doing with pennington several seasons ago opponents will have to respect favres veteran savvy something they had not done with pennington was last season an omen of things to come or was it favres last gasp the packers guessed that it was closer to a last gasp on the other hand a motivated brett favre on center stage can be deadly there are far more questions than answers now
1909489 instead of favre who earlier last season helped lead the packers to the nfc championship game and finished second in the leagues mvp voting packers general manager ted thompson would rather have three quarterbacks on his roster with a combined zero nfl starts why it isnt just because favre wanted to unretire it cant be it has to be something as fundamental as thompson and maybe head coach mike mccarthy too having lost faith in favres ability to win games if so thompson miscalculated yet again
1909490 yes the jets are in the same division as the new england patriots but theyre also in the same division as the miami dolphins and the buffalo bills they play oakland kansas city st louis and san francisco a nine win season maybe a game better isnt inconceivable at least not any more inconceivable than favre in new york
1909491 it will be strange to see favre in a jets helmet it would have been strange to see him in any helmet that didnt have the games best logo that classic g on the side
1909492 it will be a matter of how quickly favre can learn this new language one huge advantage he has is hell be working with bill callahan who knows the west coast offense and can help translate the jets offense for favre and show favre how it is similar to plays hes run in green bay in the past favre shouldnt have a hard time adjusting it just may take a little time

1909565 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogan and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel i guess the kids would go to college or something like that that was the studios idea

1909569 offering 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 1 2 billion to exxon mobil a company that last quarter made the same amount of money in 30 seconds that a typical ohio worker makes in a year
1909570 is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon and senator mccain not only wants them to keep every dime of that money he wants to give them more so make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain
1909571 through june exxon employees have given obama 42 100 to mccains 35 166 chevron favors obama 35 157 to 28 500 and obama edges out mccain with bp 16 046 vs 11 500
1909572 spoke up against the administration and congress and senator obama when they gave us an energy bill with more giveaways to big oil and really no solution to our energy problems
1909573 i think senator obama might be a little bit confused yesterday he accused me of having president bushs policies on energy thats odd because he voted for the presidents energy bill and i voted against it i voted against it had 2 8 billion in corporate welfare to big oil companies and theyre already making record profits as you know senator obama voted for that bill and its big oil giveaways i know he hasnt been in the senate that long but even in the real world voting for something means you support it and voting against something means you oppose it

1909603 the law confers no protection for an idea which is what the olympic games is it and other leading events exist on their present scale only because of continued funding but you can create significant and lasting revenue streams only through the sale and control of rights the contractual framework governing rights from television and sponsorship to ticketing and merchandise is essential to the existence of each sporting event without lawyers creating and policing this framework there is no commercial proposition and no global audience

1909609 soltanto in italia si contano come morti sul lavoro al fine di poter dare benefici assicurativi da parte dellinail anche le morti che avvengono per incidenti stradali capitati mentre si va al lavoro o mentre si torna a casa a fine giornata morti che evidentemente sostiene nulla hanno a che vedere con la sicurezza in fabbrica
1909610 il momento di smetterla dice di criminalizzare gli imprenditori italiani se infatti estrapoliamo gli incidenti che avvengono in agricoltura e in edilizia vedremo che in italia la sicurezza delle aziende manifatturiere ai migliori livelli europei
1909611 le dichiarazioni di castelli sono pericolose e prive di fondamento un vero attacco alle norme sulla sicurezza sul lavoro

1909613 castelli si vergogni di fronte allitalia e chieda subito scusa a tutti coloro che hanno avuto un parente morto o ferito per cause di lavoro
1909614 castelli e gli altri rappresentanti del governo oltre al business e agli appalti pensino anche al valore della vita umana
1909615 singolare che si voglia estrapolare i settori dellagricoltura e delledilizia perch sono lavoratori di serie b forse perch in questi settori sono spesso impiegati gli immigrati il sottosegretario si occupi di pi delle condizioni delle strade che i lavoratori sono costretti a percorrere e investa in trasporto pubblico anzich in polemiche

1909669 none of gilberts allegations are true i do not know anyone named bobby gilbert i hired and paid money to thomas arthur not bobby gilbert to kill troy wicker
1909670 bobby gilberts affidavit is wholly without credibility because 1 gilberts extensive list of convictions that include a murder and a capital murder among other convictions establishes that he is a despicable human being who has no credibility 2 the time of gilberts 11th hour affidavit makes it suspect and 3 gilberts affidavit is inconsistent with the overwhelming evidence that convinced three separate juries to convict arthur for capital murder
1909671 efforts to determine whether the rape kit performed on judy wicker is still available for dna testing

1909720 that top nicaraguan government officials are deeply involved in drug trafficking
1909721 relationship with the new york times was by far its most valuable among newspapers according to cia officials from 1950 to 1966 about 10 cia officials were provided times cover as part of a general times policy to provide assistance to the cia whenever possible
1909722 there are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt i believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows
1909723 none of the witnesses gave any evidence that would show the contra leadership was involved in drug smuggling
1909724 who some in the agency refer to as the cias house reporter
1909725 that the cia helped start and played a major role in promoting the crack plague
1909726 although nicaraguans took part in the drug trade of that era most of the cocaine trade then can be attributed to colombian and mexican smugglers the nicaraguans accounted for only a small portion of the nations cocaine trade blandons own accounts and law enforcement estimates say blandon only handled a total of about five tons of cocaine during a decade long career that is a fraction of the nationwide trade of the 1980s when more than 250 tons of the drug were distributed every year
1909727 how the crack epidemic reached that extreme on some level had nothing to do with ross
1909728 king of crack key to the drugs spread in l a
1909729 if there was an eye to the storm if there was a criminal mastermind behind cracks decade long reign if there was one outlaw capitalist most responsible for flooding los angeles streets with mass marketed cocaine his name was freeway rick
1909730 ross did more than anyone else to democratize it boosting volume slashing prices and spreading disease on a scale never before conceived
1909731 coast to coast conglomerate was selling more than 500 000 rocks a day
1909732 while there is considerable circumstantial evidence of cia involvement with the leaders of this drug ring we never reached or reported any definitive conclusion on cia involvement we reported that the men selling cocaine in los angeles met with men on the cia payroll we reported that they received fund raising orders from people on the cia payroll we reported that the money raised was sent to a cia run operation but we did not go further and took pains to say that clearly
1909733 for even just a couple of cia connected characters to have played even a trivial role in introducing americans to crack would indicate an unconscionable breach by the cia it is essential know whether the agency contributed to this result or failed to exercise diligence to stop it
1909734 strongly suggested high level c i a knowledge of that connection
1909735 i feel that we did not have proof that top c i a officials knew of the relationship
1909736 cia officials insist they knew nothing about meneses and bland ns tainted contributions to adolfo calero or other contra leaders
1909737 i have personal knowledge that the cia knew nothing about these guys bland n and meneses these charges are completely illogical
1909738 we knew about him and he obviously knew some people who were contras one official said
1909739 reports of mr meneses links to the nicaraguan rebels are not new
1909740 the most significant contribution by mr meneses that the newspaper could find was a 5 735 tab he was said to have helped pay at a 1984 dinner
1909741 although mr berm dez like other contra leaders was often paid by the c i a he was not a c i a agent
1909742 even cia personnel testified to congress they knew that these covert operations involved drug traffickers
1909743 fought giving us access to essential records and to witnesses in government custody
1909744 did the u s government play any role in supporting or condoning drug smuggling into the united states
1909745 a principal responsibility of the press is to protect the people from government excesses the post among others showed more energy for protecting the cia from someone elses journalistic excesses
1909746 an inclination born of bitter history to accept as fact unsubstantiated reports or rumors about conspiracies targeting blacks
1909747 what is one to make of the riveting assertion made by a convicted colombian drug kingpin at manuel noriegas florida drug trial that the medell n cartel gave 10 million to the nicaraguan contras carlos leader is a key prosecution witness the u s government cannot lightly assail his credibility
1909748 revisit a significant story that had been inexplicably abandoned by the mainstream press report a new dimension to it and thus put it back on the national agenda where it belongs
1909749 faces a challenge in the contra cocaine matter not unlike the governments restoring its credibility in the face of public distrust over its perceived role in the handling of these events
1909750 and then the hurricane picked me up and sent me to mexico i swear
1909751 the hero solves a personal problem and undergoes a change that endears him to us forever we are grateful for their experience because most of us do not have the time in our busy lives to pursue self transformation instead we go to the movies we pay movie stars a lot of money to show us how to change normal everyday distractions obstruct them from the hard introspective work of determining their purpose in life

1909777 in response to purely speculative figures announced in the press regarding the number of downloads and the price paid for the album the groups representatives would like to remind people that as the album could only be downloaded from the bands website it is impossible for outside organisations to have accurate figures on sales
1909778 however they can confirm that the figures quoted by the company

1909782 one thing that i see the musicians wanting is more independence and you know more control over their destiny the one downside to it is that for the most part the reason they make music is because theyre damaged goods and theyre generally not that bright when it comes to making business decisions so eventually the vampires that survive the aftermath of the industry collapse will figure out a way to get their fingers back into these guys
