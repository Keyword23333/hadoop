7300000 una muerte digna no es lo mismo que eutanasia ya que esta pr ctica consiste en realizar actos que van directos a producir la muerte de una persona muy distintos son las acciones encaminadas a disminuir el dolor y el sufrimiento y que ayuden a que la muerte natural se produzca dignamente y con el menor sufrimiento posible
7300001 en chile hace falta hablar sobre el dolor y sufrimiento como un factor que forma parte de la vida humana y que tratamos de evitarlo por todos los medios incluso en la infancia de esta manera estamos negando la vida un sufrimiento no necesariamente mata puede hacer crecer a la persona la muerte es algo natural y en ese sentido tenemos que profundizar lo que significa vivir en todos los aspectos incluido el dolor como elemento de vida
7300002 como si morir sin dolor fuese un obsequio es falaz esa servidumbre inevitable a personas resueltas a impedirnos la muerte
7300003 la locuci n derecho a morir es emblem tica no s lo de nuestra frivolidad respecto al suicidio y nuestro anhelo de m dicos buenos que nos maten en el momento oportuno y del modo correcto sino m s fundamentalmente del repudio de nuestra autopropiedad corporal y las responsabilidades que la acompa an

7300010 wir haben verdient gewonnen lediglich vers umt das 2 0 zu machen
7300011 wir betreiben hohen aufwand sind nach vorn aber nicht zielstrebig genug
7300012 aufgrund der schlechten ersten halbzeit m ssen wir mit dem einen punkt zufrieden sein
7300013 mit einem remis in d sseldorf kann man zufrieden sein
7300014 wir haben die bremsen ausgetauscht und das auto war dadurch ganz anders zu fahren
7300015 wir m ssen diese probleme l sen die uns das ganze wochenende zeit und positionen gekostet haben es war ein schwaches wochenende
7300016 ich hatte einen guten start und habe drei pl tze gutgemacht das war aber mein einziges highlight
7300017 wir haben es uns selbst schwierig gemacht weil wir im qualifying so weit hinten gelandet sind
7300018 das hat mich viel zeit gekostet aber ich hatte nicht die pace um ihn zu berholen
7300019 ich kam zur ck und fuhr an ein paar autos vorbei aber als ich versuchte einen der force india zu berholen bracht ich das man ver ab und hatte kontakt das tut mir leid
7300020 leider kam ich nicht schnell genug an giancarlo vorbei um meine zweistoppstrategie voll auszunutzen

7300047 keep coming keep coming keep coming at bat after at bat at bat after at bat
7300048 youve got to be cold blooded to be in that situation and actually only focus on seeing the ball and staying in your zone
7300049 he throws real hard but i knew the situation with the bases loaded i was trying to get the runs in at the time
7300050 just being ahead like that and boom we lost it was just a tough game to swallow
7300051 amazing great job to be able to get to him in that inning and get to the bullpen it says a lot about how much our guys battled at bat for at bat
7300052 both those pitches that he hit out i really liked them
7300053 but were a long way from there i still believe we have a streak in us to get us there but time is going to start running out and we have to start showing that were good enough to be that kind of team
7300054 we have to score some runs to give our pitching some cushion
7300055 our starters are all real good pitchers but none of them right now are shutout types
7300056 i still think the people we have here are good enough to get this done
7300057 our lineup should be good enough to score the runs we need i keep looking for that streak that streak we havent had all year and i have to keep thinking that the streak is going to start with our next game
7300058 objects reflect their creators spirit which you impart to your boat as you work on it the longer your work the more of your spirit the boat will have

7300060 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7300061 i dont think it the london games will be on the same level as china because theyve got such big resources but london will put on an equally good show
7300062 but we dont sit here cowed by anything weve seen
7300063 we have been dazzled we have been impressed we have been blown away by these beijing games but we have not been intimidated and in our own sweet way without wasting tax payers money i am convinced that we can do just as well in 2012
7300064 i think we accept that it is unlikely you will see a games on this size and scale and stature again
7300065 the ioc in 2001 reached the conclusions that the focus must be much more on sustainability that big is not necessarily better
7300066 beijing has been very good the venues were superb the planning was clearly in place we knew the city would dress for a games embrace the biggest show on earth
7300067 but i like to think that london had it not already been the iocs blueprint would have instinctively got there to remain relevant the games must go on providing benefits long after the show has left town
7300068 there is no possible justification for leaving a second 80 000 seater stadium in london
7300069 the temporary nature of over 55 000 of those seats built on five rings means you can be very creative the way you wrap it with moving images its actually very exciting for us
7300070 it will be under pinned by all the security you expect but also recognising that we want this to be a celebration in our own back yard thats the balance you are always striking
7300071 the bcci is our richest sports institution the president sharad pawar has been good enough to give rs 25 crore earlier for the development of other games to a sports ministrys nsdf
7300072 i had to have injections for my neck and luckily i have got a great doctor and a great team or i might not have made it
7300073 as it was it was pretty tough in the race and i had a lot of pain but i dont think i lost any time in the race because of it i never lose time
7300074 i think the spasms started when i woke up at around 5 a m yesterday saturday and they were so bad i was struggling to stand up
7300075 i had to have injections in my neck and i took some painkillers and i got through it but it was tough pedro was looking forward to racing i know that
7300076 i have had a miserable weekend really from the day i arrived i have a lot of flu symptoms a fever every day
7300077 i have had low energy just felt poorly with problems with the spasms in my neck which led to me being in doubt for the weekend and obviously for this race
7300078 a woman was flying from seattle to san francisco unexpectedly the plane was diverted to sacramento along the way the flight attendant explained that there would be a delay and if the passengers wanted to get off the aircraft the plane would re board in 50 minutes

7300116 ohayo gozaimasu risa chan thats a very pretty bikini youre wearing
7300117 to be honest we were surprised at first but when i though about your history together i guess that it made sense if thats what you two decided if thats what makes you happy then we support you all the way after all risa chan is like another member of the family so we trust you
7300118 you have no idea how much that means to me
7300119 you should be careful make sure you tie the knot properly okay
7300120 thats right it was just an accident so calm down okay
7300121 im starting to get cold can we go inside risa chan
7300122 well i dont mind i dont want you to catch a cold
7300123 onii chan you shouldnt make her all jealous like that
7300124 its not that i dont trust you niigaki san in fact i think of you as an older sister but im just scared that youre going to steal eri chan away
7300125 eris not going anywhere i dont want to steal her away from anybody i just want her to be happy
7300126 can i ask why whenever i looked at you you would blush
7300127 still trying to adjust to seeing two girls together like that
7300128 by the way do you know what onii chan was talking about earlier before eri chan cut him off
7300129 well im sure if you look around room youll find an answer
7300130 do you want me to walk with you to the bus stop
7300131 the days are over before i realise that theyve begun
7300132 really thats good i wore this because i knew that you would like it
7300133 to be honest we were surprised at first but when i though about your history together i guess that it made sense if thats what you two decided if thats what makes you happy then we support you all the way after all risa chan is like another member of the family so we trust you

7300136 if it had been perfect all seven judges would have given me 10s
7300137 i didnt know that thats what i was doing at all
7300138 the main thing i was trying to do during that competition was enjoy myself and i think people pick up on that and if they see you enjoying yourself they enjoy themselves
7300139 i was really nervous for the 3m and i was using that nervous energy to sharpen up but it went to pieces i decided that this time it has to be completely different rather than letting the emotions and the anxiety control me and make me sharper maybe i should enjoy it and let my body do it itself that was my winning mentality
7300140 we cannot be more pleased with the chinese peoples presentation of the games and their hosting of the games
7300141 they did an absolutely amazing job running the meet if we needed water they had water if we needed ice they had ice if we needed a towel somebody got us a towel i cant explain to you how well run the meet was
7300142 we pledged a clean team it appears weve done that
7300143 these games are significantly more competitive than those in athens
7300144 coming in we said that china was going to be a strong country and as the host expected a bump
7300145 you see that more in their gold medal count right now than maybe their total medal count for the increase theyve had from previous games
7300146 we dont gauge our performance strictly on the number of medals
7300147 weve been clean and drug free we could not be more proud of how this team has behaved and exhibited olympic ideals
7300148 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7300149 as the most intangible legacy but also a very important one is that through the games china as been scrutinized by the world
7300150 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world i believe that this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7300151 we have politicians we have other ways to do that
7300152 i think the olympics are about brining people together our hearts go out to people in other countries who arent in the best situations but as an athlete we all have been focusing on performing to the best of our abilities and our next event

7300160 setiap orang membuat kesalahan itulah sebabnya pada setiap pensil ada penghapusnya
7300161 wahai pensil tugasmu yang pertama dan utama adalah membantu orang sehingga memudahkan mereka menulis kamu boleh melakukan fungsi apa pun tapi tugas utamamu adalah sebagai alat penulis kalau kamu gagal berfungsi sebagai alat tulis macet rusak maka tugas utamamu gagal
7300162 kedua agar dirimu bisa berfungsi dengan sempurna kamu akan mengalami proses penajaman memang meyakitkan tapi itulah yang akan membuat dirimu menjadi berguna dan berfungsi optimal
7300163 ketiga yang penting bukanlah yang ada di luar dirimu yang penting yang utama dan yang paling berguna adalah yang ada di dalam dirimu itulah yang membuat dirimu berharga dan berguna bagi manusia
7300164 keempat kamu tidak bisa berfungsi sendirian agar bisa berguna dan bermanfaat maka kamu harus membiarkan dirimu bekerja sama dengan manusia yang menggunakanmu
7300165 kelima di saat saat terakhir apa yang telah engkau hasilkan itulah yang menunjukkan seberapa hebatnya dirimu yang sesungguhnya bukanlah pensil utuh yang dianggap berhasil melainkan pensil pensil yang telah membantu menghasilkan karya terbaik yang berfungsi hingga potongan terpendek itulah yang sebenarnya paling mencapai tujuanmu dibuat

7300476 corruption in afghanistan is endemic it hurts the poorest people disproportionately pushes people away from the state and undermines our joint efforts to build peace stability and progress for afghanistans peoples
7300477 i welcome the recent steps that the government has taken by becoming a state party to the un convention against corruption adopting new anti corruption legislation and the establishment of a new anti corruption body
7300478 together they can act effectively as a watch dog to ensure that public services reach those most in need and that government officials are held accountable to the people they serve we must all stand up and say no to the corrosive influence of corruption
7300479 it is vital that the state allows sufficient space for afghanistans civil society and the media to be able to effectively play this role i urge the government to work towards strengthening these areas of national legislation on our part the united nations pledges its continued assistance to the government and peoples of afghanistan as we work together to remove the scourge of corruption
7300480 i call on donors to commit resources as soon as possible the requested amount of money needs to come in soon
7300481 the sooner donors react to the appeal the more suffering we will be able to prevent
7300482 the ana afghan national army and coalition forces killed 30 insurgents
7300483 planes bombed the area and in the result 25 taliban were killed including two famous commanders
7300484 unfortunately five civilians were killed and one woman and a boy were wounded
7300485 deminers put their lives at risk every day to ensure the safety of their communities attacking them is a cowardly act and an assault on the entire civilian population
7300486 mine clearance is crucial to allow reconstruction economic recovery and build lasting peace deminers and their work should be valued and protected

7300494 we did a hell of a job putting america back where it belongs on top of the world
7300495 it is more important and more special than any championship that any of us will ever win
7300496 we put our time and hearts into this to come through and finally win the gold medal not just for ourselves but for america it means a lot
7300497 it means everything to me its so rewarding to see your hard work pay off
7300498 they countered our game plan by making some incredible plays every possession counted if it wasnt for our determination we wouldnt have pulled it through
7300499 dwyane made a couple big plays and we all know kobe likes the ball down the stretch
7300500 we played well we almost had it we fought to the end we had a chance
7300501 that probably goes down as one of the greatest games in olympic history
7300502 all three of us took time out and took the moment in being part of the 04 olympic team and not getting to show our talent we really wanted to win this

7300511 em biden obama escolheu um senador conhecido por sua experi ncia em assuntos internacionais mas tamb m por sua destreza no combate pol tico
7300512 se obama pretende sanear a cultura pol tica de washington escolheu como seu escudeiro uma emin ncia parda n o um rosto novo
7300513 comparado com obama que freq entemente descrito como calmo e emotivo o senador joe biden direto e despreocupado
7300514 obama diz que representa um novo tipo de pol tica n o partid ria mas fez uma escolha conservadora de companheiro de chapa
7300515 biden em muitos sentidos o que obama n o tem experi ncia conhecedor de assuntos exteriores e cat lico
7300516 talvez e isto o mais importante n o seja temeroso com um hist rico de classe trabalhadora e estilo combativo biden poderia resistir s tentativas do partido republicano de qualificar obama de elitista
7300517 obama se exp s a duas cr ticas a de que est compensando sua pouca experi ncia como o presidente dos eua george w bush fez quando escolheu dick cheney e que a inclus o de biden enfraquece o argumento de obama segundo o qual a sabedoria mais importante do que a experi ncia
7300518 preciso dar cr dito a obama porque n o permitiu que estas obje es t ticas o impedissem de escolher um companheiro impressionante
7300519 deve se perguntar importante escolher algu m que me ajude a ganhar a elei o ou algu m que me traga benef cios se eu realmente ganhar
7300520 com sua escolha de joe biden obama sabiamente optou pelo ltimo
7300521 o fato de obama ter escolhido biden sugere que ele n o se intimida com os colaboradores e conselheiros fortes e conhecedores que possam questionar seu pensamento e que assumam tarefas importantes

7300618 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7300619 inside the stadiums things have gone very very well reporters seem very pleased with the number of press conferences that were held and the degree of access they had to officials however outside the stadiums we have confirmed more than 30 cases of reporting interference heard of another 20

7300626 faced the well trained chinese squad and americans who were traditionally strong in summer olympic games
7300627 honestly speaking i did not even expect that the russian team will leave beijing with this result
7300628 we witness improvement in all spheres including mass sport and this would not have been possible without serious financial inputs in this sphere
7300629 incidentally our expectations were more optimistic but the result is logical
7300630 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7300631 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration
7300632 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7300633 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7300634 our troops will be recklessly pulled out and our enemies handed a victory they have neither won or deserve i will see the war through to victory
7300635 no nation has ever become more secure retreating from a conflict that they are winning or by standing down their troops in the face of a sworn enemy
7300636 dont worry about it well keep all our options open
7300637 well trust the men at the scene to make the decisions
7300638 its unpatriotic or treasonous to ask such questions in wartime
7300639 it would be great if we could permanently stabilize iraq but we could also get stuck in a mess over there like we were a few years ago the truth is that the calm over there probably wont last forever and things could easily go to hell again maybe we oughta take advantage of this opportunity to get out while things are calm

7300673 at one point i did not think i would recover and be able to race but i had injections and i made it
7300674 i felt it during the race and it was tough for me but i dont think i lost any time the team had pedro de la rosa the reserve driver waiting to race and of course he wanted to because he is spanish
7300675 i felt bad from the start of the weekend with low energy fevers every day and the spasms in my neck luckily i have a great doctor and trainer and we got through it
7300676 it came back after a little while but i lost confidence and it affected me

7300696 what we found is that when men recalled their own offenses they were more likely to empathize and then forgive but they had to do that emotional work first
7300697 when the women started thinking about their own offenses they tended to feel defensive and guilty and that made it harder for them to forgive
7300698 my father was physically abusive but the most intense hurt was his refusal to talk to me after i hit him
7300699 i just didnt know how to start the process of forgiving
7300700 it wasnt until i was in my forties when i was able to empathize with my fathers situation that he had learned ineffective parenting from his parents and that he was short tempered because he was physically ill that i was able to forgive him
7300701 this was the 60s and early 70s and there were not resources that we knew of to help us
7300702 forgiving my father and my mother for staying helped me learn to trust my instincts and myself be more present in relationships and build loving honest bonds with others
7300703 forgive for love the missing ingredient for a healthy and lasting relationship
7300704 now i can remember good things about him he was an incredibly effective childrens advocate and community organizer in harlem for example
7300705 the things he passed on to me my sense of justice fairness political sensitivity history and my power as a voting consumer are greater gifts than the scars he left behind

7300734 i was shocked and confused i was filled with so many emotions no matter what happened at big brother i had spent considerable time with her in the house
7300735 i felt really bad for her now i know why i couldnt recognise her when i met her life has put her through so much she had changed
7300736 but she had to be whisked away immediately from lonavla monday early tuesday morning she had her flight from where she had to be taken for chemotherapy in london
7300737 speaking to her was not easy it was very tough there was never any rancour

7300741 my only precondition was that jade should be treated well at big boss

7300794 i see barack obama in the context of the evolution of hip hop
7300795 when barack took his recent world tour the reason why so many young people came out in all those countries is because the way young people feel about the united states is theyre shaped more by hip hop than by president george bush
7300796 i would encourage rappers to use their lyrical genius to elevate the consciousness of young voters obama is taking care of the politics the rappers we should take care of the culture and at a certain point the culture needs the politics and the politics need the culture we support the artists artistic freedom without being censored but on the other hand with freedom comes responsibility

7300817 the global warming scare has been popularized to benefit big government politicians environmentalists and researchers whose funding is contingent upon endorsing it credible scientists do not attribute this as being man made even proponents admit that warming stopped nearly a decade ago while we should all be good stewards of the environment i dont support crippling our economy and sending manufacturing jobs overseas where co2 caps will be ignored simply to promote politcal agendas
7300818 if you look at history you see variations in temperature from ice ages to times when it has been much warmer than now the corelation between co2 and warming has been disproven th esun is responsible for most warming between 1940 and 1980 when co2 levels were rising temperatures were falling temperatures have been falling again for 6 years some scientists are warning of an ice age again that was the big fear when i was in school then came the hole in the ozone layer
7300819 that human activity is a significant cause of global warming has been soundly rebuked by qualified scientists using sound methodologies while the earth has undergone numerous cycles of warming and cooling trends there is no indication that human activities either now or in the past had a significant effect on these trends
7300820 at this point i do not believe that the scientific evidence supports the position that global warming if the same exists is not a function of sun activity rather than human activity no study i have been made aware of uses mandlebrot mathematics chaos math to do its projections it is a fact that the mathematics of climateology requires the use of chaos mathematics to describe it as it is a chaotic system the use of liner models is just bunk

7300830 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7300831 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7300832 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7300833 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7300854 for sen bidens iraq hearings to be anything more than a political sham used to invoke a modern day gulf of tonkin resolution equivalent for iraq his committee will need to ask hard questions and demand hard facts concerning the real nature of the weapons threat posed by iraq
7300855 but we dont sit here cowed by anything weve seen
7300856 we have been dazzled we have been impressed we have been blown away by these beijing games but we have not been intimidated and in our own sweet way without wasting tax payers money i am convinced that we can do just as well in 2012
7300857 i think we accept that it is unlikely you will see a games on this size and scale and stature again
7300858 the ioc in 2001 reached the conclusions that the focus must be much more on sustainability that big is not necessarily better
7300859 beijing has been very good the venues were superb the planning was clearly in place we knew the city would dress for a games embrace the biggest show on earth
7300860 but i like to think that london had it not already been the iocs blueprint would have instinctively got there to remain relevant the games must go on providing benefits long after the show has left town
7300861 there is no possible justification for leaving a second 80 000 seater stadium in london
7300862 the temporary nature of over 55 000 of those seats built on five rings means you can be very creative the way you wrap it with moving images its actually very exciting for us
7300863 it will be under pinned by all the security you expect but also recognizing that we want this to be a celebration in our own back yard thats the balance you are always striking
7300864 i sense a real thirst to stage the games and what weve seen in beijing inspires us
7300865 we will do a fantastic job im less moved by where we finish in the medals table what i do want in 2012 are big british moments
7300866 howie is a great guy and a fantastically energetic force and we welcome him back i think we are at our best with howie as he adds an element of brutality to our most melodic parts on recordings and fans love his frantic energy on the live stage
7300867 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7300868 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7300869 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7300870 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7300871 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7300872 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7300873 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7300874 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7300875 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7300876 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7300877 hij zal wel weer lijden aan tunnelvisie en dit vanuit zijn eigen roomskatholieke standpunt verkondigen
7300878 ook onder wat spiritueel lijkt zit een flinke dot materialisme verborgen
7300879 im overwhelming convinced this is ms all i need is the testing to confirm it
7300880 om wat dieper te kunnen discussieren en zodoende andere gezichtspunten te keren kennen en dan ik tot nu toe gewend ben op de andere heksen en paganistische fora waar ik kom
7300881 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
7300882 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
7300883 missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war
7300884 the signing now insures an escalation of tensions between russia and nato and a new cold war arms race in full force it is important for readers to understand the ability of one of two opposing sides to put anti missile missiles to within 90 miles of the territory of the other in even a primitive first generation anti missile missile array gives that side virtual victory in a nuclear balance of power and forces the other to consider unconditional surrender or to pre emptively react by launching its nuclear strike before 2012
7300885 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
7300886 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
7300887 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia

7300909 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7300910 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7300911 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7300912 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7300913 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7300914 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
7300915 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
7300916 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7300917 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7300918 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7300919 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7300920 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7300921 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7300922 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7300923 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7300924 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7300925 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7300926 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7300927 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7300928 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7300929 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7300930 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7300931 general opinion in the party is in favor of parting ways
7300932 i am also willing to contest the presidential election but i am bound to obey what the party decides
7300933 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7300934 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7300935 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7300936 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7300937 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7300938 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7300939 when the budget does pass and assuming as we expect we are spared the budget cuts well be ok
7300940 hes a lot more sociable a lot more talkative thats awesome if this werent available id be screwed thats the best i can say this has been a godsend
7300941 thats why we dont want to borrow more even though the state is advising us to
7300942 but were considering it when the economy is turning down as it is now those stresses multiply for parents
7300943 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7300944 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7300945 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7300946 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7300947 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7300948 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7300949 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7300950 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7300951 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7300952 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7300953 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7300954 intrusion on certain computer system that compromised some open ssh packages

7300956 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7300957 a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7300958 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and join me in making washington work for the american people i searched for a leader who understood the rising costs confronting working people and will always put their dreams first
7300959 today ive come back to springfield to tell you ive found that leader
7300960 president lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place and then stand firm
7300961 today in springfield i know my feet are in the right place and im proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7300962 still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds
7300963 thats the kind of fighter i want by my side in the months and years to come
7300964 john mccain served our country with extreme courage and i know he wants to do right by america
7300965 but the harsh truth is loud and clear you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7300966 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7300967 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7300968 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7300969 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7300970 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7300971 we will continue to deliver weapons to hezbollah and hamas
7300972 i love this country its the number one country in the world and im holding its flag
7300973 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7300974 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7300975 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7300976 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7300977 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7300978 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7300979 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7300980 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7300981 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7300982 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7300983 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7300984 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7300985 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7300986 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7300987 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7300988 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7300989 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7300990 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7300991 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7300992 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7300993 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7300994 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7300995 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7300996 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7300997 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7300998 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7300999 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7301000 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7301001 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7301002 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7301003 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7301004 wah no wonder you went to babe house lah u ordered from her right
7301005 three things in human life are important the first is to be kind the second is to be kind and the third is to be kind
7301006 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project
7301007 i have been wearing extensions for years and there is nothing out there like this product every woman should have one
7301008 carece de una visi n estructural porque no se habla del ataque a la impunidad c mo mejorar las condiciones salariales de los polic as y de evaluaciones a las fuerzas militares
7301009 si realmente se quiere atacar el problema de la inseguridad hay que abordarlo desde la econom a y atender el problema estructural educativo que son los ejes centrales para construir un pa s hacia el futuro en sus encuentros en materia de seguridad el gobierno federal los estatales y el capitalino no han ofrecido una movilidad social para los j venes al contrario los han criminalizado
7301010 a efecto de establecer un mejor equilibrio entre los poderes y proveer de instrumentos modernos para la rendici n de cuentas y la modernizaci n de los procedimientos parlamentarios
7301011 lesiona violentamente los derechos adquiridos en a os por los profesores
7301012 s lo refleja la posici n particular de una persona y no constituye formalmente la decisi n y convicci n del magisterio mexicano
7301013 at the moment rescue teams fire brigades and medics are rushing to the crash site
7301014 se castiga a quien no tiene para comprar la justicia
7301015 pues s lo se castiga al que no tiene con qu comprar la justicia
7301016 los asesinatos no se van a resolver con medidas policiacas amenazas de mano dura m s c rceles penas m s largas no es un problema de impunidad porque no se aplica la ley parejo para todos siempre hay protecci n para unos cuantos maleantes
7301017 hubo toda una campa a para meterle miedo a la gente inventaron que si ganaba iba a haber una cat strofe en todos los rdenes
7301018 it is unconscionable for the democratic leadership to allow the head of a group that is connected to terrorism and that spreads hate against others to participate in a political convention we demand that mattson be disinvited from speaking at the democratic convention immediately isna and mattson should be condemned for their actions
7301019 political recolonization of the muslims by economic political and military means
7301020 security certificates terrorism legislation cant raise money legally stress on the legal part for hezbollah which is absurd and must be challenged because hezbollah is a legitimate political party arar khadr both of these brothers were tortured under the liberal watch so dont trust them either
7301021 all of the media set the agenda in any western democracy
7301022 if you dont do what i tell you to do i will vote against you
7301023 if you know beverly byron youre going to do what she says shes been extremely helpful in this campaign and thats one of the other reasons were going to win this election
7301024 find a job that you love and you wont have to work a day in your life
7301025 4 for example success2you com or makemoney4real com i also dont recommend too many hyphens or dashes just one is usually enough
7301026 my website is www web biz income 4 real com thats double you double you double you dot web hyphen biz as in bee eye zack zee then hyphen income hyphen four as in the number 4 yeah just the number dont spell it okay after that hyphen real dot com okay got it all why dont you read it back so i can confirm it
7301027 good things dont come cheap and cheap things dont come good
7301028 why do i want it whats the real reason when i say it out will i feel the energy burning in me
7301029 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7301030 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7301031 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7301032 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7301033 i think the age is good where it is at
7301034 if youre old enough to be adults at 18 and take responsibility if you can vote and change law why not be able to drink
7301035 everyone already does it anyway so it would make sense if it was lowered there wouldnt be such a hype to get alcohol if the age was lowered
7301036 i have not signed either document nor have i cast wkus position in the debate im more interested in whats right for us we will determine our institutional values in our community rather than be shaped by some national debate
7301037 obviously theres going to be more drinking and i think theyll take advantage of that freedom
7301038 and it could influence people younger than 18 to drink its an awful lot of responsibility to give a young person
7301039 if they want to drink theyre going to drink whether 18 19 20 or 21 theyre going to drink no matter what
7301040 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

7301043 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket
7301044 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the democratic party
7301045 has a high regard for sen clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration he felt that sen biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7301046 what it really shows is barack obama has the confidence and the judgment to pick someone who is really experienced and is willing to speak their minds
7301047 they have given their very best in a fair play environment and achieved amazing results by breaking 38 world records and 85 olympic records
7301048 the chinese people have honored their commitments they solemnly made
7301049 they have given their very best in a fair play environment and achieved amazing results by breaking 38 world records and 85 olympic records
7301050 the chinese people have honored their commitments they solemnly made
7301051 this is not the musical this is an early 1990s band from ottawa ontario canada this is lively bouncy pop very upbeat with the quirky vocals of meg lunney and the more usual vocals of jonathan evans neile
7301052 i had the great pleasure of seeing five guys named moe when they supported martin stephenson and the daintees playing in derby back in 1990 on the daintees
7301053 this is a deceptively breezy collection of songs with an underlying take on the pains and oddities of human exsistence a great album sure to put a smile on your face on even the greyest of days
7301054 five guys named moe was born in ottawa canada in the mid 1980s
7301055 her album the margaret anns 1998 featured two ex members of fgnm is the only known album
7301056 ive been a touring musician a studio musician a songwriter a co producer and a producer since 1988
7301057 im one half of a pop duo who also feature my twin bro grant weve been playing and writing songs too long but cant really stop this train together weve performed under various guises including divided and an earlier oufit called the gathering theres also been some solo shows too some people may remember us as the bottlers an affectionate nickname given to us by some wag which hung around for a few years ill put up some new and old tunes whenever i get a free moment the first is asylum which i wrote a few years ago i think the second one holdinon we wrote together
7301058 these guys are really good even if nobodys ever heard of them they sorta sound like soundgarden with talent
7301059 the first big f album is also hurt by girlfriend inspired
7301060 i keep listening to kill the cowboy that is such a badass song robs drum work is wonderful if youre a berlin fan only its the cool type of work he did on pictures of you which still wows me johns voice badass it has a lot of that jim morrison intensity that jim didnt do enough of you know how he ended the songs light my fire and break on through i love the growl and marks sound is great and technical
7301061 the music and energy from this cd is unpredictable and awesome its a shame this trio never caught on you can occasionally hear some of this cd on knac com this cd is out of print though
7301062 the big f is essentially berlin without the chick singing
7301063 i dont think the big f ever reached a point where berlin became an issue
7301064 an instrumental trio ready to blaze a new trail of amped up country with a mix of bluegrass and rock driven by mark christians blazing lightning fast electric guitar banjo and mandolin
7301065 shes just up there you know you become more of a devoted u of u fan when your little daughter is up there
7301066 the chinese people have made great efforts and overcome many difficulties for the hosting of the olympic games the success of the beijing games has enhanced the national cohesion as chinese we all feel very very proud
7301067 the motherland and people feel proud of you we extend warm congratulations and heartfelt compliments to you who have won immense glory for your country and people
7301068 this is probably the only chance in my life to watch the olympic games on the spot my happiness is beyond language as i can witnessing china host the olympic games and also top the gold medal tally
7301069 i think the chinese peoples century old dream has really come true
7301070 none of the 51 gold medals we won were churned out in track and field so sports workers in our country must work harder to improve our athletics strength
7301071 i watched a handball match this morning it was wonderful to feel the olympic games so close
7301072 i hope one day i could represent china at the olympic games in equestrian maybe because i like riding and often tried it in the suburbs
7301073 i saw a kid from the quake zone walk beside yao ming famous basketball player to lead the chinese athletes at the games opening which demonstrated that people were paying great attention to us we shall rise from sorrow and rebuild our homeland
7301074 the most important thing is you must take a positive attitude toward adversities
7301075 if we can successfully host the olympic games today we certainly can overcome any difficulty caused by the earthquake in the future
7301076 i have received strict training including foreign languages first aid and basic security knowledge i have been working here about eight hours a day since july 8
7301077 vaccinating older girls and women who have active sexual lives will have an effect but it will be much less than immunising the virgins
7301078 there is the real anxiety that these older girls and women may think that they had had a magic bullet are protected dont go for their smears and the cancers arent picked up at an early stage
7301079 we are looking at the most effective uses for the vaccine and are currently assessing the strengths and weaknesses of offering it to over 18s including cost effectiveness
7301080 there is no evidence that extending the vaccination to over 18s would deter women from having smear tests receiving the vaccine could in fact provide an opportunity to remind women of the need for screening
7301081 berlin was one of the pioneers of new wave and electronic music in the early 1980s
7301082 terri nunn rocks terri nunn and berlin one of the great ladies of the new wave scene of the 80s
7301083 a great band that did some wonderful songs back in the 1980s
7301084 berlin was one of the best bands in the 80s
7301085 when we met jo julian we decided to find a female singer realizing that most european synth bands had that low male voice and that having a female voice might set us apart
7301086 im an actress im used to learning my lines quickly
7301087 toni child was the original singer in the band and wanted to leave for a solo career they auditioned people and answered my ad i had no experience but they answered it because i said i wanted something original berlin at that point was the most original thing in music synthesizer music hadnt happened yet in america and was just starting in england and germany john heard bands like kraftwerk and ultravox and wanted to do that kind of music the sound was like nothing i had ever heard
7301088 we had a lot of places to play but we also had a lot of people laughing at us because we werent what was going on at all at that point it was power pop and the big success stories were the knack the go gos and the motels punk was still going on with the cramps the zippers and even the red hot chili peppers were playing the circuit we were playing we got a lot of strange reviews but we really believed in it and got better
7301089 we signed with a label just starting out called enigma they signed 2 bands their first year berlin and motley crue once the sales increased geffen came in and bought enigmas contract they were also just starting ou t and were distributed by warner brothers for us that was huge because they were small enough that we mattered they gave us a lot of attention because they didnt have that many bands and that made a huge difference to us
7301090 with john and i i think the reason we had so much success is i related so much to what he wrote about and wouldnt sing anything i didnt understand or didnt feel in my gut
7301091 berlin was formed in the summer of 1979 jumping on the new wave techno pop bandwagon that was starting to permeate the music scene
7301092 in 1979 after recording their single matter of time at drummer dans home studio it was released to the media
7301093 we certainly got more airplay than what we had originally thought it opened up a few doors for us to play at more shows
7301094 we figured by the third time our release would be pitched to big record labels to see who would take it no one did and so we paid for it ourselves
7301095 on this date in 1980 berlin released their first album information
7301096 well what we did was we took the demo tape or our manager perry took the demo tape around and none of the la labels liked it
7301097 it sounds european and thats not happening in america go over to europe and try to get a deal
7301098 we already have too many bands that sound like this and youre american and no one in europes going to listen to an american band unless they sound like springsteen or billy joel
7301099 well maybe we ought to try to go for an independent deal
7301100 we didn t realize at the time that our music was the start of what we now call electronic music berlin s early sound has moved into so many different genres and morphed into industrial trance and even electroclash bands like interpol fisher spooner and goldfrapp are actually direct descendents of what we were doing we were first inspired to create our sound from a couple of european bands ultravox and kraftwerk that were using these new kinds of keyboards that created very different sounds than those of a standard keyboard or piano it created a whole new dynamic that we fell in love with and we just thought wow that s just amazing we figured that since those bands had male singers if we had a female singer we might have something that was different and unique even if it wasn t as good but because it wasn t really happening here yet it was hard we were laughed at and people didn t get it at the time we came out the exciting music that was being signed was by bands such as the knack the plimsouls the gogos and the motels it was all skinny ties and a lot of upbeat happy guitar stuff the record labels just didn t understand what we were doing luckily we believed in ourselves kept going and got better as songwriters finally laughs it got to a point where a tiny record label called enigma which was just starting out took a chance on us
7301101 emotion as objective as i can be the only problem with electronic music is the barren nature of it its generated by machines in a lot of ways thats pretty much the way to say it it can sound very cold and my voice for better and for worse sometimes is anything but cold god growing up i lived on emotions i had to learn how to be logical because i would react first with my heart and second with my mind and that can be a big problem but in music and in that kind of music it the emotion brought the warmth to that kind of music that it needed
7301102 originally released by the fledgling enigma records in 1982 and picked up by geffen in early 1983 when the lascivious novelty single
7301103 as i listened to all of this cd i kept asking myself why i didnt buy this when it first came out in 1983 id always heard sex played on the radio and never investigated further this cd is a great example of early 80s rock with p oppy sounding synthesizers out in front and of course terri nunns sensual voice if you can get past the overplayed sex im a and listen to the rest of this cd youll realize what an enjoyable listen it is nothing wrong of course with sex im a but if you think thats all berlin was youre missing a lot songs like the metro yeah tell me why world of smiles g and the title track all sound hot btw the bonus track is an extended version of sex and while it doesnt add much to the cd its still a hoot to listen to especially the ending berlin only put out this ep and two albums in its original incarnation the band reformed in 1999 with terri back on vocals i beleive theyre currently working on a new cd it will be interesting to see if it reaches the same heights and energy as this one did way back when
7301104 after cutting a single and breaking up bassist and synthesizer man john crawford and lead vocalist terri nunn resurrected berlin with a new lineup that included dave diamond and rick olsen on guitars matt reid on keyboards and rod learned on drums although he only performed on the first track of their debut ep pleasure victim the remainder being done by daniel van patten
7301105 im a a goddess im a man well im a virgin im a man im a blue movie im a man im a b tch im a a geisha im a a little girl and we make love together
7301106 if you like berlin but havent got this album you might be disappointed by the rather cheap and raw synthesizer production on it
7301107 im a little girl im a hooker im a goddess im a one night stand
7301108 each and every song on this album is a classic they personify what 80s new wave was all about it is a shame the real berlin broke up after their third album the new line up only contains terri nunn whom i do love the new group just doesnt contain the fire needed to make berlins signature style of music tell me why and the metro and the best cuts on this cd but every song is highly listenable and you will find yourself humming along then singing along then memorizing each song lyric definate must have
7301109 berlin emerged in the early 1980s with the dawn of mtv
7301110 hey andrew the us festival was very strange i was never comfortable in front of very large crowds and that was by far the largest we also did a show with the police the thompson twins and the fixx in front of about 50 000 people and i was quite uncomfortable there as well i think it is the sense of not knowing how you are going over with the crowd you cant see faces and the sound sort of disappears into the air let me explain when you watch a band perform you will notice these big black boxes on the floor near each player they are monitors or speakers that direct the sound coming through all the microphones back at the musicians believe it or not i have played shows where when the monitors were off i could not hear the sound going out through the main speakers to the crowd onstage you really rely on the monitors to hear the drums guitars vocals whatever the problem is the sound itself it can be very sterile and sometimes out of balance it can actually be quite depressing you wonder if what you are hearing is what the crowd is hearing and it sucks i always enjoyed smaller venues where i could hear and feel the crowd not only their energy but also the sound of the band reverberating in the room so not only was i scared to death at the us festival 200 000 people and u2 coming on right after us the sound was strange and i was feeling more isolated from the crowd than ever before still a great memory and something cool to tell the grandchildren having been a part of that show with u2 my eighties heroes and david bowie my seventies hero wow
7301111 with their second album berlin started to hit their stride
7301112 love life finds berlin honing their brand of upbeat synth new wave into something more polished and its an improvement although there arent any songs that are risque as their notorious single from pleasure victim
7301113 you can take me home and tear my clothes off
7301114 now its my turn you hurt me then ill never let you hurt me again
7301115 dont think youll get away the pain has just begun
7301116 youre telling me you love me while youre looking away
7301117 looking for a long romance not a picture of passion or one time chance
7301118 they tell you try to have hope and fight for all you can these words youve heard them before so easy to believe
7301119 i remember when this album came out back in 1984
7301120 you could spend the night with me and never know you were here in my dreams
7301121 despite the overplayed popularity status of no more words this was one atmospheric and moody synthesized production thats a good thing berlins love life project demonstrated they were true pioneers and leaders in the genre of new wave pop for the 80s they were the poster children american pop band for the musical world with their gq and vogue looks underneath it all there was genuine artistic skills and innovativeness that emitted through from the earth bass synthesized rumbling of the opening track when we make love to the frenetically charged and provocatively produced touch the listener is taken through a world of love life relationships and yes revenge all sleeked up by retro 40s stylish noirish videos and album photos the euro dance sound of dancing in berlin was a tribute to german synthesized pop a la kraftwerk style in my dreams has to be the albums most catchy hook laden tune that harkened the seriousness of the song pleasure victim from the album by the same title the track pictures of you was pure mtv pop rock material for that time period along with its california based new wave west coast sound finally the ballads were warm and intelligible without becoming fluff fodder or filler they maintained their warmth despite being heavily covered in the synth technology of the time love life was berlins most popular album because it was a refined version of the previous mini ep pleasure victim and was not as highly experimental and distracting as their 1986 count three and pray cd love life is the essential berlin cd to obtain from the 80s
7301122 a major change of direction for berlin count three amp pray was an artistic triumph but a commercial disappointment
7301123 i think the song is a beautiful creation but it is not berlin georgiomoroder the writer along with tom whitlock and producer was writinga number of songs for the top gun soundtrack he and terri were quiteclose following the work with no more words and dancing in berlin heasked terri to sing on the song it was not to be a berlin song this wasaround the same period that 3 of us had left and the group wascrumbling quickly heck look at all the people used on count three asrecord companies are they talked georgio into allowing berlin to be listedas the performer even though terri was the only member on it inaddition he also agreed to allow its release on count three and pray
7301124 im doing this song and its going to be in this amazing movie and its coming out next summer and you might be able to sing it
7301125 i kind of messed around with it cause it had problems with the melody it was a little stiff giorgio was kind of a stiff writer anyway and so i kind of played with it and loosened it up a little bit and they loved it so they gave us the job and john hated it because he was 25 or whatever and it wasnt our song and here was yet another non berlin idea that was thrown on us that he didnt want then it became the biggest hit that we ever had and so that was just taking the dagger and stuffing it even deeper and twirling it so now we had to play it every show too laughing cause thats what everybody wanted to hear but absolutely i would do it again it was such a great great ride to see the world to see people everywhere who fell in love with us because of that song
7301126 listening to count three amp pray after its original release almost 15 years ago still reminds me why this album was not a major hit except for the overplayed and exhausted single take my breath away
7301127 by the time berlin released count three and pray they were a trio consisting of terri nunn rob brill and john crawford
7301128 we never learn but we know too well heavens died and gone to hell
7301129 give me the time ill show you im not your enemy lets end the cold war
7301130 the needle was our life our hope our trust turning into dust
7301131 i have seen some silly comments about this album like it is one of berlins best well berlin only released two albums and one ep this was an experimental cd with berlin trying a few different styles there are some very good songs on the cd but there are also some clunkers the only hit is take my breath away which is a good song that has been overplayed and if you ever take the top gun ride at paramounts great america you have to listen to it over and over again while you wait an hour in line berlin was started in 1980 by john crawford who found teri nunn through audtions berlin was one of the leaders of blending new wave and punk music with disco they put out the incredible pleaure victim ep on a independent label it was only 27 minutes long they were discovered by geffen records who rereleased pleasure victim in 1982 it wasnt until 1984 when berlin released a full length album called love life it was a complete departure from pleasure victim consisting of nondescript slow love songs set to a pop synth beat by the time count three and pray was produced the whole disco influence in music was fading and new wave wasnt far behind berlin tried to evolve out of that scene they were successful to some part but not totally this album flopped because it didnt please the pleasure victim fans or light pop fans who preferred love life after this berlin broke up in the nineties teri nunn got a back up band and has toured from time to time as berlin she released a live album last year the title of this cd comes from a 1950s western starring van heflin
7301132 whatever berlins fans say or its detractors this is berlins best album hands down
7301133 terri nunn kicked around los angeles in search of a film career for several years
7301134 for the casual fan of berlin in the eighties or for someone who never really heard their full work this is an awesome cd at a reasonable cost
7301135 take my breath away is indeed a beautiful song there are so many other great classics by this group which deserve as much attention
7301136 ive known of berlin ever since i heard and loved
7301137 berlin vocalist terri nunn is an icon as the charismatic vocal and focal point for a band that virtually launched electronic dance rock in the us terri earned the no 11 spot on vh1s list of the 100 greatest women in rock
7301138 terri nunn is the greatest woman who walked this earth
7301139 i went through a lot of searching and i worked with other people a lot on their stuff i worked with perry farrell on a movie of his called the gift i worked with andrew eldrich from the sisters of mercy on a song for his best of album i worked with a jazz artist dan siegel on one of his records it really felt like i was getting out of a cage for the first time because i d been working with john or doing berlin since 1979 finally it felt like i could finally do anything i wanted i had money so i just enjoyed collaborating with other people on different things for a while then i finally settled on a couple of partners to make a record for me which was called moment of truth i wrote most of the material with karl hyde from a band called underworld it finally came together we recorded it in 1991 and it came out in 92 how is moment of truth different from what you did with berlin it s completely different it was all over the map too much so actually it was a mess i just tried to do twenty different styles of songs laughs on one record rap dance pop ballads rock it was just everything the problem was that it just wasn t unique i was trying to be too many different things it had some good moments but it just didn t hold together as an album it would do better if it were released now because people don t buy albums anymore they just download singles
7301140 it was kind of a mess because it was everything
7301141 is she rap is she rock is she a balladeer is she new wave is she techno or what
7301142 i remember right about when my album came out they had just signed nirvana
7301143 after i did the solo record i worked with other people for awhile
7301144 with berlin having hit an artistic high note on 1986s bob ezrin produced count three and pray it was most regrettable when the trio broke up
7301145 the first thing i do is thank terri for something she did back in 1991
7301146 and i got married all i ever had was music so i really wanted a life
7301147 in 1991 she recorded her first and only solo album
7301148 this was recorded at the little purple guys studio called paisley park studios in minneapolis
7301149 you can drive on a road to nowhere or you can take the wheel and turn it to your heart its your life its your life
7301150 flew high above his shame leaving the words its too late for me
7301151 i ask not what i can do for my country cause i wonder sometimes if it cares for me
7301152 unlike other remixed cds from eighties groups duran duran for example these songs sound incredibly fresh
7301153 i agree with another reviewer in that this is not the best remix
7301154 this disc unlike other remix albums such as missing persons actually gives a new spin on songs this mainly results from the obviously overdubbed voice of the reinvented terri nunn the remixes by astralasia and aqualite are tremendous and the piano version of take my breath away is wonderfully minimalist but the most radically different version and therefore best is transmutators version of pleasure victim it has mystical properties to it this should be a staple at any dance club
7301155 i knew it when i first started with them but i didnt find the magic combination until mitchell sigman the keyboard player came into the band right after the release of the live cd
7301156 i love it thats why i do it i dont love the studio i get in and out as fast as i can for me the live experience is everything its why i got into it everybodys there and happy into the music and there to have a good time were all getting off at the same time from what were hearing for me whether im an audience member or on stage just being in that whole environment to me is one of the greatest drugs ive ever had
7301157 berlin burst onto the scene with the ultimate movie ballad from top gun entitled take my breath away
7301158 dont know if the world was waiting or even ready for an in concert berlin record but berlin live sacred and profane holds more guts than expected considering the vast keyboard capacity of terri nunns vehicle
7301159 last year in the summer of 2001 we decided to put out an e
7301160 we own your music mr artist heres a quarter thank you very much
7301161 why dont you make a list of people you want to write with and call them
7301162 it has the same keyboard based sound and it s as electronic as ever it s just more contemporary we incorporated a lot of inspiration from bands like garbage and sneaker pimps and even industrial artists like nine inch nails but there is a lot of new technology new sounds and new directions i really thought that what i can add to the mix of today s electronic music is a message in the lyrics i write to me messages are really important in music bands have changed my life not just for the sound but also for what they ve said to me in my younger years i didn t have a lot of stability we were a family that moved a lot so my records were my friends i listened to them and their messages about love war friendship loss and pain all that i learned a lot about life people and myself that s what i wanted to keep in the music and that s what i felt was missing from a lot of contemporary music trent reznor has some great messages in his music
7301163 terri nunn still has it strong vocals and an awesome band despite the fact all band members have changed every live track on here rivals the sound if not exceeds the original studio releases from the 80s the sound of the music is more rock alternative than new wave pop there is more guitar than synthesizer this c d lives up to its live portion my favorite tracks are touch the metro for all tomorrows lies terris tender and romantic side the haunting you dont know and sex still steamy after all these years as for the last three new studio tracks it is a shock to the system to hear berlin using rap on blondies old tune shayla the last two tracks wings and xgirl are nothing more than techno filler pop and are considerably weak despite nunns distinct and strong vocals with the addition of a talented back up singer charlene gibson new band members and an up to date rock sound sacred and profane is worthy of all the stars minus the last three studio tracks
7301164 it was so nice to see some new material from berlin
7301165 more a terri nunn album then a berlin in that the sound is totally new and more like terris own solo album of a few years earlier however i enjoyed this album and hearing ms nunns vocal talents again most of the tracks are good listening if not classics and very polished performance
7301166 first let me tell you the energy that resonates off this cd alone is amazing
7301167 as time went on the roadhouse crowd grew to capacity everybody anxiously waiting for their slice of 80s heaven berlin
7301168 berlin werent they like a techno pop band how can they rock hard
7301169 this has been a golden age of this band for me there were two golden ages during the first and second record and right now everybodys been in the band for three years and the guitar player about five years its not easy to find a group of people who are equally committed and get along and are talented that are happy with what theyre doing and happy with each other so when it happens its huge its been like that with this group of people for three years now there definitely will be more records
7301170 a little dissapointing for a long time berlin fan like myself but i always try to keep an open mind this is a mix of some new tracks covers and rare tracks a good fan addition
7301171 produced and engineered by mitchell sigman 4play features the live berlin line up of sigman on keyboards chris olivas on drums and guitarist carlton bost deadsy with terris emotive crystal clear vocals sounding as passionate and dynamic as ever
7301172 these are songs from our favorite artists that weve enjoyed playing live over the years this is the first time i didnt have a record label telling me no so i finally got to record all of these songs into one compilation
7301173 i originally recorded that song with producer david kershenbaum tracy chapman duran duran for the best of berlin
7301174 it never made that record so im really happy to release it now in light of whats going on in the world for me september 11 was a huge wake up call that america needs to be more self protective as a country stephen stills wrote the lyric theres something happening here in the 60s but he really called it the message is still very timely
7301175 he said weve never done that song acoustically and i think it would sound pretty good
7301176 we were at the very beginning of the electronic movement in america and thats something im proud of
7301177 it wasnt easy because we didnt know if it was just a fad or something that would last we were so inspired because electronic music took rock n roll to a new level beyond just bass drums guitar and vocals to become anything you wanted it to be the exciting thing for me now is that it can be anything i want it to be live when we tour today we have computers running on stage and video content running simultaneously with the music its fantastic
7301178 the possibilities of electronic music are endless and i dont mind expanding on my own legacy in that genre
7301179 oh well what could we do except not use that name anymore but then we had to come up with a new one sitting at chris house i looked up and saw a beer mug that marked berlin chris and his family were from germany and the name stuck from then on we were known as berlin
7301180 my partner was german and he was in love with that whole era of the berlin time the art the music and the whole scene was just so exciting and we didnt have anything like that going on in america at the time so i guess we were trying to be who we werent so we cultivated the look the mystery the whole thing that we thought berlin should be we were trying to bring it to america really
7301181 joe julian who had left the band years earlier asked drummer dan if he would like to move to england and work with him
7301182 music is a nine to five job 9 00 a m to 5 00 a m that is i just needed a break
7301183 matt reid cohn is a musician and composer from long beach california
7301184 i do my music and photography projects near the ocean in southern california
7301185 i dont know exactly what happened to jo julian i know he went to london and owned a studio there that was a long time ago and i have not heard anything about him since
7301186 after berlin i worked on a number of projects with a variety of people
7301187 were just waiting to see if theres any bone or ligament damage
7301188 scotts injury was a surprise he trained and hes a brave wee soul
7301189 i thought there was something wrong with his ankle but they tell me its his abductor muscle
7301190 i cant complain with second place weve had quite a strong weekend
7301191 ive had a pretty traumatising weekend ive had a few problems but i seemed to pull through with a great team behind me
7301192 it has been very hot and in these suits its like driving in a sauna but im pretty happy with the way i got through
7301193 at the start i was on the dirty side but got a reasonably good start
7301194 i was nowhere near as quick as felipe but i just had to try to hold my spot robert was pushing quite hard for the first couple of corner but after that i was pretty relaxed and was able to try to keep up with felipe
7301195 but he was out in front and its pretty difficult to overtake here i tried to maintain a certain gap but towards the end i think he just decided to stretch it out a little bit
7301196 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7301197 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7301198 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7301199 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7301200 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7301201 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7301202 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7301203 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7301204 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7301205 en este momento los equipos de rescate los bomberos y el personal sanitario se dirigen al lugar en el que se estrell
7301206 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7301207 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7301208 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7301209 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7301210 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7301211 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7301212 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7301213 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7301214 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7301215 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7301216 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7301217 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7301218 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7301219 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7301220 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7301221 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7301222 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7301223 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7301224 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7301225 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7301226 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7301227 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7301228 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7301229 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7301230 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7301231 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7301232 our monitors to sound at a decent volume when the summing buss is peaking 0dbfs and the rms levels are proportionally high
7301233 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7301234 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7301235 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7301236 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7301237 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7301238 you are very cool so beautiful movie new york minute is fantastic i love your style
7301239 i am come from serbia and i dont understand english my favorites movie is holiday in the sun and getting there i watc
7301240 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7301241 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7301242 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7301243 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7301244 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7301245 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7301246 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7301247 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7301248 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7301249 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7301250 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7301251 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7301252 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7301253 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7301254 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7301255 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7301256 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7301257 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7301258 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7301259 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7301260 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7301261 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7301262 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7301263 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7301264 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7301265 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7301266 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7301267 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7301268 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7301269 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7301270 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7301271 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7301272 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7301273 i thought i was beyond getting nervous about giving a speech because ive given thousands
7301274 the path that these two people have traveled is uniquely american
7301275 i want to bring it down to a pretty basic level about who they are and why they represent the best of us
7301276 has more in common with most missouri families than john mccain does
7301277 weve tried it john mccains way for 7 1 2 years and it hasnt turned out very well
7301278 weve tried a foreign policy thats just focused just on iraq weve tried economic policies that are all about tax breaks for the very wealthy weve tried giving big oil everything they wanted frankly the results have really kind of stunk

7301286 a million dollar friend is someone wholl stay despite the fact that as we travel along several new people will come and go

7301338 i do think canada can get to the top 12 in 2012 but its going to take a big effort i do think there is a need for more investment
7301339 there were a number of events out there where we got a silver and i thought dammit just short of the gold
7301340 our ultimate objective at some time has to be how many gold medals will we win were certainly talking about that a lot more
7301341 we would appeal to prime minister stephen harper to give us the extra 6 million dollars wed asked for in the last budget
7301342 wed asked for 30 million lets look at the extra 50 or 60 million were going to need over the next few years to try and build the kinds of programs theyve got in britain and australia and the united states
7301343 if were going to play with the big boys if were going to be a g8 nation lets be g8 at all levels
7301344 its definitely hard to compete with the top countries especially when you look at diving trampoline and gymnastics
7301345 it was so difficult to compete against the chinese athletes here and the programs they have in place are just amazing
7301346 funding has to come early enough that theres time for the athletes to prepare and have access to everything they need and the support they need to compete with the top countries in the world were already seeing small improvements and hopefully its going to continue that way
7301347 we made a decision some time ago to start targeting the money and we realized we couldnt be a mile wide and an inch deep
7301348 australia targets the sports where they know they can get medals
7301349 im not sure we can ever be as targeted as that and i dont think canadians would accept that we have a certain egalitarian nature that is going to demand that every kid gets a chance but we can target more than we have in the past
7301350 the more you see of these tremendous young people the more you want to see of them but if you dont see them and you dont know who they are there isnt that passion to watch them
7301351 its tough enough in the ups and downs of the olympics world its another game in the ups and downs of the political world
7301352 athletes are training to perform in the sports world we would be very careful how they might be used in the political field

7301387 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7301388 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7301389 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7301390 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7301391 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7301423 my son is only in primary 5 why have lessons during the long holidays when they already have compulsory supplementary classes twice a week during term time
7301424 whats three days of lessons in a kids life i feel sorry when he asks me why he cant play she said
7301425 three days will not get her more a in the psle not when shes only in primary 4
7301426 unless theres a family emergency we want students to come back for the classes they need the time to prepare for the examinations
7301427 its in small groups and not compulsory though we encourage them to come its the only time we can do something to help weaker pupils catch up with their classmates
7301428 you want the students to enjoy but you also want them to study our students need focus and motivation and the momentum to keep studying
7301429 if she has problems she can ask her teacher its extra help for her and is better than staying at home
7301430 its important that after one semester they reflect recharge so they come back renewed
7301431 the girls get so tired and some dont show up because of vacation plans so we target them throughout the school year rather than ask them to come back during the holidays
7301432 mr chia dont you feel like its wasted half day on your off day
7301433 of yesterday it seems that many came much fatigued to school this morning having studied hard both for english and chemistry well that explains why many of us just couldnt seem to stop nodding off during lessons
7301434 i hate people who are nodding off during my lessons just put your head on table it really hurts your neck that way see mrs ng is so nice to allow you to sleep during her lessons
7301435 no they havent exceeded the 10 mins for the case
7301436 i had to have injections for my neck and luckily i have got a great doctor and a great team or i might not have made it

7301459 i have been asked many times how we can live up to beijing which has been a phenomenally successful games
7301460 that is not what we are trying to do we will be trying to create our own unique olympic experience and we are confident of showing the world something very special indeed
7301461 the platform created by athletes from great britain in beijing has been fantastic
7301462 it has done a lot to excite the media and young people we need to build on that over the next four years
7301463 the only reason l c gets paid more than anyone else is because she demanded in her original contract that no one could ever get paid more than her

7301465 we dont want him in the white house he says he has seven kitchen tables we dont want to give him an eighth kitchen table we understand he has a wonderful life this is a great country but millions of americans at this hour are suffering through a housing market that is collapsed housing foreclosures so when john mccain gets up in the morning and leaves his house to lock his door he has to shuffle through a number of keys to figure out which key works in which door in which home hes at at any given time
7301466 what concerns me more than not exactly knowing how many homes he has bob and jesses right it shows hes out of touch but when he said in january that americans have done well under the george bush economy hes so out of touch hardly any american except people who make five six hundred thousand dollars plus have done well under this economy wages are down everything else is up americans middle class working americans are getting slaughtered under this economy how could he have said that

7301470 im of the opinion i went first they followed me personally i think theyre crazy for joining the army i think i set the example for joining the air force

7301488 so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7301489 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic

7301491 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit pissed off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines i think hell always probably tend to be around 40

7301499 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7301500 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7301501 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7301502 barbarians thats what they are they kill innocent people here how many kilometers miles outside the battlefield they bombed all over georgia

7301508 every olympic medal won by canada was my favourite moment
7301509 the canadian mens eight rowing team winning a gold medal was a great show of strength and character
7301510 the best moments were the opening ceremonies and the eric lamazes win
7301511 back in the late 1970s and early 1980s energy was really the only game in town
7301512 we are doing as much or more than other cities
7301513 this is a chance to show that we are a green convention town
7301514 the great thing about denver and all of the rocky mountain west is that it doesnt matter out here who your parents were or your grandparents were it matters who you are and how hard you are willing to work to achieve your dreams and thats a liberating sensation to have in a community
7301515 when we first moved down here there were practically more pigeon occupants than people
7301516 the life its brought the energy just the reinvigoration of the city feels good when you have the preservation of the urban core with its cultural architecture with the legacy of that its something special
7301517 almost from the beginning of denvers history there was suburbanization now for the first time we see wealthy people moving downtown the core city is actually growing
7301518 theres a bit of d j vu for those who remember the early 1980s
7301519 we are a huge economic contributor to this state and as a reward for that contribution we are facing this complete overhaul of the oil and gas regulation
7301520 youve got different values going on in the state amp y ouve got areas outside denver that were once farmland that are now becoming housing development where there is oil and gas development
7301521 attitudes are different here than they were 20 years ago
7301522 there is much more public pressure now than there was 20 years ago to better manage
7301523 we have a real sense of if you build it they will come that was true in 1908 and its very true today
7301524 by cities like aurora and other suburbs that arent doing anything about environmental issues
7301525 lets not lose sight of the fact that were going to be a carbon economy for decades we can all work together but you dont have to bash oil and gas to promote renewables
7301526 you do good deeds you get good deeds youdo bad deeds you get bad deeds
7301527 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7301528 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather

7301531 el campo de fuerza personal de aquellas personas que tienen relaci n con lo sagrado o determinadas nimas divinidades o esp ritus
7301532 es una fuerza diferente del esp ritu que se encuentra en todo el universo este man se puede encontrar en todos los seres vivos y atravesando todo el universo fundamentalmente en el sol y en los alimentos
7301533 es una fuerza una influencia de orden inmaterial y en cierto sentido sobrenatural
7301534 la diferencia entre un sacerdote y un cham n es que un sacerdote es un funcionario en tanto que un cham n es alguien que ha recorrido una experiencia en nuestra tradici n es el monje que busca la experiencia mientras que el sacerdote es el que ha estudiado para servir a la comunidad
7301535 en ninguno de stos casos es reconocido como cham n sino hasta despu s de haber recibido una doble instrucci n
7301536 y es preciso tambi n tener en cuenta el hecho de que la iniciaci n propiamente dicha no exige nicamente una experiencia ext tica sino que como vamos a verlo lleva aparejada tambi n una instrucci n te rica y pr ctica demasiado complicada para ser accesible a un neur tico que est n o que no est n sujetos a ataques reales de epilepsia o de histeria los chamanes los hechiceros los hombres m dicos en general no pueden ser considerados como simples enfermos porque su experiencia psicop tica tiene un contenido te rico si se curan a s mismos y saben curar a los dem s es entre otras cosas porque conocen el mecanismos o mejor a n la teor a de la enfermedad
7301537 la vocaci n cham nica al igual que cualquier otra vocaci n religiosa se manifiesta por una crisis por una ruptura provisional del equilibrio ps quico del futuro cham n
7301538 los mitos son ante todo las manifestaciones ps quicas que reflejan la naturaleza del alma
7301539 el hombre primitivo es de una subjetividad tan impresionante que en realidad la primera presunci n hubiera debido ser que existe una relaci n entre el mito y lo ps quico
7301540 advertimos perfectamente que con stas tentativas de explicaci n nos exponemos al reproche de atribuir al salvaje actual una sutileza ps quica que traspasa los l mites de los veros mil pienso sin embargo que con la psicolog a de los pueblos que han permanecido en la fase animista podr a sucedernos lo que con la vida an mica infantil cuya riqueza y sutileza no han sido justamente estimadas durante mucho tiempo por la falta de comprensi n de los adultos
7301541 los escasos documentos de los que disponemos acerca de los sue os cham nicos nos muestran a las claras que se produce as una iniciaci n cuya estructura es ampliamente conocida en la historia de las religiones que no se trata en ning n caso de alucinaciones an rquicas ni de una afabulaci n estrictamente individual estas alucinaciones y afabulaciones se atienen a modelos tradicionales coherentes bien articulados y de un contenido te rico asombrosamente rico
7301542 el contenido de las experiencias ext ticas iniciales admite casi siempre uno o varios de los temas siguientes
7301543 no hemos tomado en consideraci n que el esp ritu gracias a su original autonom a que desde el punto de vista psicol gico tambi n es innegable est absolutamente en condiciones de revelarse as mismo
7301544 la manifestaci n ps quica del esp ritu demuestra que tiene una naturaleza arquet pica es decir que el fen meno que denominamos esp ritu se funda en la existencia de una imagen original aut noma que en forma preconciente existe en la disposici n de la psiquis humana de manera universal
7301545 el hombre primitivo como en todo ser humano el deseo de relacionarse con lo sagrado contrarresta el terror de verse obligado a renunciar de su condici n simplemente humana y a convertirse en un instrumento m s o menos maleable de una manifestaci n cualquiera de lo sagrado dioses esp ritus antepasados tc
7301546 de los aspectos anteriormente nombrados debemos tener en cuenta que
7301547 los antiguos chamanes no necesitaban nunca la ayuda de la datura para entrar en trance
7301548 estas historias deben su poder al hecho de ser nicas e individuales y por consiguiente distintas de los yoes sociales y de las expectativas colectivas de la realidad cotidiana
7301549 al igual que con la lectura de un poema su significado se revela con el transcurso del tiempo conforme el individuo sigue viviendo y desarrollando otras perspectivas
7301550 todos los seres existentes tienen dobles las ropas los utensilios las armas todas las cosas las plantas los animales y los hombres tambi n este doble que hay en todo lo real se presenta ante los ojos del hombre como sombra reflejo o imagen

7301565 but were a long way from there i still believe we have a streak in us to get us there but time is going to start running out and we have to start showing that were good enough to be that kind of team
7301566 we have to score some runs to give our pitching some cushion
7301567 our starters are all real good pitchers but none of them right now are shutout types
7301568 i still think the people we have here are good enough to get this done
7301569 our lineup should be good enough to score the runs we need i keep looking for that streak that streak we havent had all year and i have to keep thinking that the streak is going to start with our next game

7301572 there was some concern that the company commissioned to instal new meters to commercial companies for the council would also be given the contract to invoice the customers
7301573 up to now the council had 600 metered customers with the remainder billed on valuation on a fixed bill charge but now they have well in excess of 2 000 customers who have been provided with the installation of the new meters which eliminates the old system the bills will now be for usage only although the new change will consist of outward charges as well
7301574 the difficulty arose when a private company was contracted to install the meters which theyve been doing for the past two years to allow for a more accurate meter
7301575 there had been rumours that the company contracted to instal the meters and issue the invoices would be given a contract to privatise the service but after taking the issue up with the officials i can give an assurance that this wont happen
7301576 ci hanno costruito la stazione della metro vicino a casa sono a 5km
7301577 although no specific development sites have been identified additional development may be considered on and sic case by case basis
7301578 i can tell you the start and complete dates are somewhat of a moving target with respect to development and construction we wont know until were in the process
7301579 the united states is our great friend they have arrived at such a difficult time it means we are not alone
7301580 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7301581 i thought it would be 4 2 i didnt think it would be 3 3 i was hoping id dodge it if you want to know the truth
7301582 we have people who are bonded who are overseeing and making sure there is no underage purchase we also have hired a security guard on location so that the situation can be monitored it is completely separate from all childrens activities
7301583 i personally do not like drinking and driving in any kind of a situation i think its a hazard to the people and for them to allow three drinks at a church function just seems to be contradictory to me

7301588 the female group came and showed their interest in climbing to the dahi handi and we told them that you are invited and whosoever would win would get the prize and they did it here our aim is to boost the morale of the female participants

7301604 absolutely of course people are hurting because of change in the economy but i think this is an appropriate spend its not just about medals its about encouraging participation that leads to better health and tackling obesity

7301621 weve certainly only got ourselves to blame four goals and four errors really
7301622 its disappointing i think we were brighter and we were better tonight than last week but you feel more disappointed that you got nothing for it
7301623 we had quite a few chances so were certainly creating them and to score two at home that should be good enough to win
7301624 its only two down though weve got 19 to go
7301625 i thought we played better football yet were on the end of a 4 2 thumping which is very disappointing
7301626 we were well aware of their strengths but i guess we just didnt deal with it as well as we should have
7301627 in those conditions we tried to bypass the midfield and once we got that happening we knew wed cause a lot of trouble and thats exactly how it worked out
7301628 losing jamal didnt help but its no excuse just basic errors around the play of the ball dropping balls
7301629 we just made some silly errors our gameplan was to keep it pretty tight and to get some go forward but we started to lose the ball in the tackle
7301630 i wont be bringing any 18 year olds into this side never say never but not at this stage theyre competing in their right grade and theres some good boys in there
7301631 we just need the game so we can mould the test team and give them a game before we play a test against australia
7301632 they want to back a winning side but we never go out there to lose on purpose and its a new playing style im trying to get out there rome wasnt built in a day and i ask the people to be patient to give us more time
7301633 it was all about execution because the chances were there but we cannot make mistakes like we did today its unacceptable for any international player
7301634 weve never had more potential as a sporting nation than weve got this year
7301635 they wouldnt let me get my new zealand flag they tried to manhandle me which is probably not a good idea
7301636 i was always a bit worried today that i was going to hit the wall at some stage of the race probably with about 400m to go suddenly the great wall of china jumped out in front of me

7301643 i love graffiti theres just something about the rawness of street art that instantly hooks me whether it be the artistry which beautifies unexpected places or a unique stencil which pops up multiple times in a city or around the world the search for good street art and street artists is a passion of mine a treasure hunt of sorts which is always exciting and never seems to disappoint that said you might imagine my surprise when i learned about the up and coming graffiti street art culture growing inside irans borders with its rich history in the arts specifically calligraphy it only makes sense that this art form would make its way into tehrans dusty and crowded streets

7301645 i cant complain with second place weve had quite a strong weekend
7301646 ive had a pretty traumatising weekend ive had a few problems but i seemed to pull through with a great team behind me
7301647 it has been very hot and in these suits its like driving in a sauna but im pretty happy with the way i got through
7301648 at the start i was on the dirty side but got a reasonably good start
7301649 i was nowhere near as quick as felipe but i just had to try to hold my spot robert was pushing quite hard for the first couple of corner but after that i was pretty relaxed and was able to try to keep up with felipe
7301650 but he was out in front and its pretty difficult to overtake here i tried to maintain a certain gap but towards the end i think he just decided to stretch it out a little bit

7301676 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
7301677 there is no historical precedent for what he has accomplished how he is accomplishing it his body of work you have at once a supremely gifted athlete with a willingness to endure unmatched levels of preparation plus hes a fantastic competitor mentally tough and someone who appears to get even better in the face of a tough challenge
7301678 you consist of two parts your physical body and your spirit which lives within your body you may have heard the expression mind over matter i would like to phrase it a little differently spirit over body that is self mastery
7301679 many years ago roger bannister participated in the olympic games as a champion in the one mile race he was supposed to win but he wound up finishing in fourth place he went home from the olympics discouraged disillusioned and embarrassed
7301680 roger went home knowing not what to say or to do but before the night was over he had convinced himself that he would develop an iron will before he quit running he was going to break the four minute mile
7301681 on may 6 1954 the four minute mile barrier was broken by roger bannister a man committed to a winning pattern which would bring him recognition worldwide roger bannister set the pattern many years ago and followed it with total commitment self discipline and a will of iron

7301714 we urge the sadc observers to produce a report characterised by integrity and honestly we have let down the suffering people of zimbabwe for too long already they deserve better

7301718 we identify three key barriers to effective coordination and collaborative information sharing across organizational boundaries intergroup bias group territoriality and poor negotiation norms
7301719 the problems we face now and into the future will only increase in complexity and it will require teams of people within and across organisations to solve them
7301720 individuals may have previous relationships with each other or may be new to each other
7301721 for example negotiations might also incorporate parties interests in the timing of information or of product sharing consideration of short term versus long term needs or the distribution of credit for joint outcomes
7301722 perhaps the single most telling issue that professionals have to resolve in effectively networking online is identifying where to focus efforts
7301723 a network structure that is both highly locally clustered and has a short path length
7301724 small world networks have been shown to arise in a surprisingly wide variety of organized systems from power grids to brain cells to scientific collaborations the high incidence with which they occur has led to the speculation that there is something fundamental and generalizable about how they organize and govern success in biological physical and social systems alike

7301733 the attempt by cegir to build this toxic dump was in total violation of the human rights of oodham indigenous communities
7301734 if this dump had been built it would have been in violation of the integral oodham right to protect their traditional homelands and their continued responsibility to conduct their traditional way of life through ceremonies that have been held at quitovac since time immemorial
7301735 the oodham creation story says that at quitovac the cultural hero iitoi killed a monster that threatened to destroy the people

7301741 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7301742 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7301743 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7301744 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7301745 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7301746 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7301747 who won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket
7301748 he felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7301749 and i was pleased that senator clinton gave such a robust endorsement to senator biden as the nominee yesterday i think it was a good choice i think everybody recognizes it
7301750 he has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration
7301751 during the taliban there was no problem for us we had a doctor near our village now its not safe for them they went away
7301752 prostitution is in every country that has poverty and it exists in afghanistan
7301753 but society has black glasses and ignores these problems tradition is honor and if we talk about these taboos then we break tradition

7301759 i do not care islam says there cannot be anyone between allah and his disciple how come these clergymen are interfering in our matter
7301760 this is finished now we came to the end we will pass from here and istanbul will be gone
7301761 what are you saying instead of having two eyes and to look back meaning to run away it is better to have one eye to look forward always and to run to give this life for the sake of allah
7301762 i cannot give you and i cannot do anything for you but the holy prophet sws is waiting in front of you he has opened his jubba to every one of you
7301763 if i was in that situation i would also be able to sacrifice my life
7301764 if they pass through from here what are we going to do
7301765 oh captain dont worry we still have a lot behind to make a mountain of men for these enemies not to pass
7301766 please cut this part this way i will be able to fight more freely
7301767 i must give up this life before i die sitting here i must die in that way
7301768 oh captain please save that piece of bread because i am already counting the minutes to go out from this life save that bread for another one of my brothers so that it may give energy to them to fight
7301769 what did we do what are we doing for the sake of allah and for the sake of holy prophet alayhi salatu wa salam
7301770 i was watching in the frontline this young girl who was shooting so bravely and she was knocking down everything that she was hitting she was sitting from morning to evening and everyone was trying to aim her but they were not able to finish her and we thought that there was a big battalion in that area because so many bullets were coming from everywhere by the evening one bullet reached to her and she fell down when she fell down we entered to that area and we only found her and another boy and we have counted sixty three bullets in her body
7301771 mother you put henna on my head and you sent me here i believe that now my brother is getting ready to come to this side because his age is up please dont put any henna on his head this way they will not make any jokes with him
7301772 my son in our village in our side we put henna only on three events one we put henna to our daughters when we give her away in marriage it means we have sacrificed our daughter for the sake of allah and she is never going to come to us we put henna on the sheep when we are going to sacrifice them and we also put henna on the soldiers when we send them to the war for sake of allah sacrificing them because they are not going to come back dont tell me not to put it on your brother i have already put it and i have already sent him he is coming he is on the way
7301773 yes these are the soldiers and these are the martyrs that is going to save islam there is no other way
7301774 if we give up too then all the muslims in this world is going to be finished we cannot give up
7301775 i am giving you this life go to the world and live the pleasures
7301776 no we will never want to go to that world but give us that life to go and to die for you again and again and again and again in your way
7301777 its okay to give them what they want and i just continue my life

7301779 certain fish stocks are in trouble but because there isnt enough scientific evidence available i cant lower the quota getting it would be hard and prohibitively expensive in some cases in the case of orange roughy it might not be possible to get the required information until the species was gone
7301780 without the right information the law requires he must go for maximum sustainable yield and that is totally biased to the commercial side
7301781 there are a range of other valid internationally accepted stock assessment approaches that can be used the bill allows those approaches to be used to legally justify catch reductions
7301782 the select committee has allowed for all groups to have their say
7301783 we havent been in the best of form of late
7301784 we knew we had to up the ante against the lions and that was a pleasing aspect for us
7301785 the win was obviously great but it was simply the cherry on top for us the quality of our performance was more pleasing its never easy to win in johannesburg never mind to score four tries but it was just what we needed after our two previous matches
7301786 i think the other teams have improved their defensive patterns this season but at the same time the field in wellington didnt help us play an expansive game against boland
7301787 against griquas however we didnt have an excuse we were just shocking on the day and the team knew it too hence the improved performance on friday night
7301788 the men from kimberley who have battled injury after injury this season moved into sixth place on the log with their second win of 2008 a crucial victory for them as they look to secure their place in the premier division of the currie cup ahead of next season

7301796 the blurring of lines between the military political and the humanitarian community is a real not an imaginary concern
7301797 we are all concerned that this is having an impact and many ngos are now traveling in unmarked cars trying to look as much like the normal population as possible earlier ngo workers were attacked when they were in the wrong place at the wrong time now we are being targeted
7301798 nowhere else in the world has such a step being taken
7301799 the guidelines will prevent a blurring of the lines between the role of the military and humanitarian actors preventing humanitarian space from being squeezed further
7301800 recognizing the distinct role that we have to play will be a vital component of protecting our impartiality and opening up humanitarian space for us
7301801 establish principles and practices for constructive civilian military relations and for effective coordination which is critical for achieving security and stability in afghanistan
7301802 intended to support the development of a relationship between military and humanitarian actors in which differences are recognized and respected
7301803 maintaining a clear distinction between the role and function of humanitarian actors from that of the military is a determining factor in creating an operating environment in which humanitarian organizations can discharge their responsibilities both effectively and safely
7301804 sustained humanitarian access to the affected population may be ensured when it is independent of military and political action
7301805 the overall humanitarian assistance effort in afghanistan is best served through a division of responsibilities government and humanitarian actors have the primary role of providing humanitarian assistance and the military is primarily responsible for providing security and if necessary basic infrastructure and urgent reconstruction assistance limited to gap filling measures until civilian organizations are able to takeover
7301806 given the significant involvement of prts in civilian affairs and in civil military liaison
7301807 real test will be how well they are implemented on the ground for example the prts and military actors ceasing the use of emergency relief for political and military objectives which undermines the perceptions of ngos being neutral
7301808 many afghans want security there is no evidence that prts engaging in relief or development activities is creating security why cant the prts and military stick to what they do best security and well stick to what we do best prts are even engaging in basic service provision in areas where ngos and government are already working at a minimum if ngos and government can operate then there is certainly no need for the prts to be doing this
7301809 this document is not perfect and it is not meant to state what the military can or cannot do everyone has had to make compromises
7301810 emergency and development aid is being used as a military and political incentive
7301811 this confuses peoples perceptions of who we are what we do and why we are doing it we deliver aid based on the needs of the population and to those who are most vulnerable not based on politics or military aims
7301812 need for clear separation between the military and the civilian actors necessary to enable aid agencies to assist people in need
7301813 international military actors increased involvement in relief and reconstruction is further complicating the operational environment for ngos particularly in terms of security
7301814 humanitarian space in afghanistan has been compromised by the military and private sector companies trying to do the same work as long term humanitarian workers some of them have very little if any humanitarian experience yet they think they can just turn up and do what we do just as well
7301815 the military should not be in the business of providing water and sanitation distribution of food and non food items nutrition programs health clinics and programs building schools and education programs the principle is called last resort when the military steps in when no one else can do it to provide life saving assistance not for some political or military purpose but in large parts of afghanistan the military is stepping in where other actors are already doing it
7301816 i think it is very important that prts do not involve themselves in humanitarian assistance unless there is absolutely no other alternative for security reasons i also think it is very important that the prts do not describe what they are generally doing as humanitarian
7301817 that is soft democratic support voters who are sitting there waiting to go to obama

7301822 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7301823 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7301824 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7301825 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7301826 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too
7301827 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here

7301831 gordon smith the sfas chief executive has spoken to the prime minister about team gb but we are unlikely to alter our position and remain opposed to the concept of a great britain football team
7301832 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk

7301844 under the new pension credit scheme the department for work and pensions dwp admits that low earners will see their retirement income increased by only 1 per cent of their salary or 2 a week after 10 years saving in the governments flagship new pension scheme to be launched in 2012 because their savings are eaten away by means testing even someone earning 25 000 a year who contributes to the new personal accounts for 20 years will only see their income in retirement increased from 31 per cent of salary to 34 per cent experts say the figures highlight the way pension credit the means tested benefit paid to pensioners with small pensions reduces the incentive for many people to save
7301845 the imaginary time bomb why an ageing population is not a social problem
7301846 historically modern societies double their wealth about every twenty five years this kind of growth projected across the next half century would dwarf the extra pension and other costs to society of more elderly dependents moreover it is far from certain that extra years of life mean extra years of ill health and dependency serious disease tends to be concentrated towards the end of life so living longer may simply postpone the point of onset without increasing the costs
7301847 well be asking two dublin legends where it all went wrong
7301848 west belfasts paddy barnes guaranteed himself a bronze medal after his quarter final triumph in the light flyweight division he now faces chinas zou shiming a home grown favourite and a man who beat paddy in the world championships last year so no surprise to see paddy power offering 9 1 about barnes taking gold and 7 2 to clinch a silver
7301849 people within the party recognise that until the stability of the assembly is more firmly established on a longer term basis there will be reluctance among people who are westminster mps to give up their seats to work exclusively in the assembly there will be a phasing in of that approach
7301850 we have a choice as a people either you continue with the division or you seek to end it my party took the position that in the right circumstances it was possible to proceed but that we couldnt concede to terror criminal activities had to end guns had to be handed over and there had be support for the police the courts and the rule of law
7301851 while political parties in ni would have wide areas where they can agree if you put the conservative party and the labour party into the same room you would have battles every day on issues of socio economic policy
7301852 the differences we have we are talking about and attempting to reach agreement on there are battles but they are ending without blood being spilt and that perhaps is the difference between now and the past
7301853 my advice would be that as democrats gather at the national convention they shouldnt be asking where the best parties are but where the local phone banks are
7301854 this is an absolute battleground if they want to help barack obama they should spend some time on the campaign trail

7301860 thats how it is for torre no hard feelings at least not for his former players and if he should find himself managing the dodgers in postseason while the yankees watch from home he insists he wont feel any additional gratification
7301861 even if i was angry at certain things i would have a tough time not being able to root for those players individually
7301862 i couldnt sit here and gloat knowing all those players that i grew close to i had a good run there for a long time
7301863 the question is how much fight is left in the dog
7301864 the yankees might look a lot different at this time next year
7301865 as free spending as the yankees have been in past theyre liable to make a fleet of drunken sailors look like a bunch of tightwads
7301866 the proposed e money regulations will put in place a prudential framework for bank issuers as well as their business partnership with non bank e money service providers
7301867 the purpose is to mitigate technology or reputational risks that may arise as well as to protect customers from unscrupulous operators
7301868 would i take it if they offered it to me absolutely i would be a fool not to

7301873 this is the pathway to change from grievance mode to growth mode
7301874 its fine for the crown who have the resources to do the research
7301875 were saying to everybody just get something in worry about the detail after we even went to the point of telling people write them down on table napkins just to get them in
7301876 you walk up to it and motion sensors trigger water to spray out in a mist and run down the wall it is atomised water so if they did get paint on the wall it is very easy to remove in the morning
7301877 all the walls we have in place are just never tagged they have a go once and they get water sprayed on them so they do not come back
7301878 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket
7301879 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the democratic party
7301880 has a high regard for sen clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration he felt that sen biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7301881 what it really shows is barack obama has the confidence and the judgment to pick someone who is really experienced and is willing to speak their minds
7301882 despite intense efforts theres really been little progress made over the last few decades in terms of outcome
7301883 even with the best treatment we have which is a combination of surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy the median survival is only 15 months
7301884 the problem is its in your head and its not like you can chop it off thats what makes it so hard to deal with you cant get away from it
7301885 its at that point we will come in and try something unique
7301886 on its own in its current form its not the big breakthrough were looking for
7301887 and we know what chemotherapy does to people what we dont know is what might happen if we combine the two treatments
7301888 because this hasnt been done before we dont actually know whether this can be done we dont know if its a feasible treatment for the patients
7301889 its fair to say that there is a lot more to understand about how these vaccinations work im confident that we can get them to be a lot more efficacious in the future based on the basic research were doing in the lab
7301890 to have a glimmer of hope would be fantastic for people because you need that
7301891 the guys have really come to the party its quite unnatural for them and some of them have felt a bit out of their depth but theyve really got stuck in and been good sports about it really
7301892 of course he spends most of his time in speedos anyway so hes pretty comfortable in his underwear
7301893 im supportive of sport in general and especially sport in wellington and glad to help
7301894 there was a very small number of painted vehicles and we understand quite a few of them went through to queenstown for skiing
7301895 its quite clear that it the undie 500 is seen as a magnet
7301896 its much improved on last year our belief has been student behaviour is improving but its still far from acceptable
7301897 its a booze trip it does have something to do with it
7301898 we had done all we could to distance ourselves from this years trip
7301899 there is no doubt the combined efforts of all these agencies resulted in reduced overall levels of disorder
7301900 in the end we remain dependent upon the responsibility of individuals involved
7301901 estou muito contente em estar aqui para mim tocar na maior festa do pe o do mundo um sonho ent o vamos transformar isso aqui no carnaval de salvador
7301902 what were seeing is the evolution of the resistance gene and the distribution of it throughout the world
7301903 we have a lot to learn about the molecular epidemiology of influenza viruses
7301904 i would just like to let people know its possible for the ministry to make mistakes i would not want my details being sent to someone else for other people to read
7301905 i would feel completely distraught i can read what this guy has been up to when hes been in court when he was sentenced what happened to him and everything
7301906 we have had dealings with the ministry of justice for a number of years both as a client and of course needing to use their services and have found the service to be superb at both ends we have never had an incident such as this ever happen before
7301907 the records are produced then collated and placed in envelopes manually it would appear in this instance two records were inadvertently placed in one envelope
7301908 there will be massive problems of supply through to christmas as a result
7301909 there will always be something in the country but supply will be so short its not enough to share around
7301910 people are paying the highest possible prices in retail stores but the quality probably is the worst
7301911 every bit of rain continues to make it worse at the moment last weekend horowhenua looked like queenstown it was white everywhere there was two inches of hail
7301912 its basic supply and demand when supply gets tight the prices go up
7301913 you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain
7301914 a good name is to be chosen rather than great riches and favor is better than silver or gold
7301915 you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain
7301916 you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain
7301917 god has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name so that at the name of jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
7301918 god told me our dad will be healed of cancer
7301919 i received a word of knowledge that your child will become a believer
7301920 the oath is swearing with appeal to the name of god who serves as witness that a person is speaking the truth or intends to fulfill a vow
7301921 the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain
7301922 you shall fear the lord your god you shall serve him and hold fast to him and by his name you shall swear
7301923 he who swears to his own hurt and does not change
7301924 what about todays new testament lesson doesnt jesus forbid all oath taking
7301925 again you have heard that it was said to those of old you shall not swear falsely but shall perform to the lord what you have sworn but i say to you do not take an oath at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king and do not take an oath by your head for you cannot make one hair white or black let what you say be simply yes or no anything more than this comes from evil
7301926 the implication seems to be that if the name of god is dwelling in a believer by the spirit then the believers word should be as good as gods and need no extra swearing
7301927 you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain
7301928 in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
7301929 the preservation of integrity should be superior to all other considerations and it is a miserable confession of weakness that the love of life or limb has been stronger than the love of virtue it cannot be too earnestly inculcated upon the young that to break a pledge is apt to be followed by the total ruin of ones virtue transgression is not a transitory thing the single act is soon done and over but it leaves an influence behind which like the adders poison may grow and operate and spread until it reaches the seat of life and triumphs in the ruin of the victim
7301930 god more regards the thoughts of the heart than the words of the mouth then say the words of the oath and in your heart think otherwise
7301931 when a man takes an oath meg hes holding his own self in his hands like water he cups his hands and if he opens his fingers then he neednt hope to find himself again
7301932 you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain
7301933 this idea is to use the smallest possible amount of toxin to knock numbers down and then use the vaccine to ensure that the tb cycle is well and truly broken
7301934 the argument is they will work far better together than they would alone
7301935 there is a vaccine available bcg which is the same as the one long used in humans we know it protects cattle against experimental challenge from tb what we dont know is whether it will protect cows from the natural challenge of tb infected possums so this trial is the first ever real world field trial of that
7301936 well use released pigs as judas animals or sentinels as a way of measuring the level at which tb continues to cycle or persist in wildlife
7301937 pigs are very good at this because they rarely pass on tb but they move around over large areas and quickly pick up tb by scavenging any tb infected possum carcasses that inevitably occur if possums are still becoming infected
7301938 there are structural issues in one particular corner of the building that need to be seen to
7301939 any building that amount of years old has issues with plaster becoming brittle and all of that sort of stuff some of the buildings ornate plaster is actually deteriorating alarmingly
7301940 the ambulance is almost at the bottom of the cliff i havent been in the building for about six months but the last time i looked at it it wasnt in good shape
7301941 my frustration is about the slow pace of events i know these things take time but unfortunately this particular case doesnt have that up its sleeve
7301942 one of the most notable and nationally significant uses was for the public meetings held in 1893 when kate sheppard led the campaign for womens suffrage from christchurch
7301943 we do have an interest in the odeons potential as a venue to bring more visitors and events to christchurch
7301944 we see that it has real potential as a wonderful venue
7301945 the fact the anniversary is during the walk is quite poignant we will have a brief minute to reflect and then get into it
7301946 as new zealand grows the growth of rail will become significant at the moment it is really left up to the teachers of kids to teach them about rail safety we want to take that back and operate with them
7301947 although this is a national campaign the aim is to focus regionally we have been going to small media outlets and community newspapers along the way often it is rural areas which are most vulnerable to these kind of accidents
7301948 this isnt some incurable disease we are talking about here its not something which requires research or anything like that it is just common sense
7301949 an emergency admission impacts on everybody anyway but with a communication disability its a thousand times worse because your mind is racing to make sure that that person is going to be supported
7301950 its a stressful situation to be in hospital youre faced with a lot of jargon and youre faced with an environment that is noisy
7301951 there is an unmet need for such vaccine products and we hope our teams can crack it by working together to get it into the clinics
7301952 ma mare aida thas de buscar un novio que li agradi caminar b de fet el teu novio haur de saber fer moltes coses per a complir les espectatives
7301953 mi madre aida te tienes que buscar un novio que le guste andar bueno de echo tu novio tendr que saber hacer muchas cosas para cumplir las expectativas mi padre bah una cosa es segura sea quien sea nos decepcionar
7301954 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7301955 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7301956 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7301957 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7301958 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7301959 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7301960 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7301961 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7301962 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7301963 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7301964 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7301965 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7301966 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7301967 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7301968 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7301969 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7301970 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7301971 i cant complain with second place weve had quite a strong weekend
7301972 ive had a pretty traumatising weekend ive had a few problems but i seemed to pull through with a great team behind me
7301973 it has been very hot and in these suits its like driving in a sauna but im pretty happy with the way i got through
7301974 at the start i was on the dirty side but got a reasonably good start
7301975 i was nowhere near as quick as felipe but i just had to try to hold my spot robert was pushing quite hard for the first couple of corner but after that i was pretty relaxed and was able to try to keep up with felipe
7301976 but he was out in front and its pretty difficult to overtake here i tried to maintain a certain gap but towards the end i think he just decided to stretch it out a little bit
7301977 derbyshire mp harry barnes was labelled as quite a vigorous stalinist underminer of british parliamentary democracy
7301978 his targets included patricia hewitt who was to become a cabinet minister and privy counsellor under new labour and harriet harman now deputy leader of the labour party and leader of the commons when they were respectively general secretary and legal officer of the national council for civil liberties now liberty in the 1970s
7301979 we are being bombarded with all these messages saying if you look like this then youll be happier it can be very hard to resist
7301980 the society we live in now places an incredible emphasis on what people look like and for young women and men this can equate to pressure
7301981 to focus on the other things in your life your natural talents
7301982 but then you throw something on them that flatters their body and the difference it makes in them is huge i can see how a lot of women will get into a rut about the way they think they look
7301983 it helps to concentrate on the things that make you liked and loved by others its up to us to recognise when it is that we are focusing too much on something it has to come from within
7301984 people dont have to have an eating disorder to have big problems with their body image
7301985 we live in a culture where women feel bad about themselves just because of the body they have i try to help them to break that
7301986 there is no money to be made from telling women that they are fine as they are i do feel ive got a lot of work to do but that is my job in life
7301987 i have been on the other side and i know what a battleground this can be inside your head
7301988 were saying to iraqis baghdad is now safe please come and enjoy yourselves
7301989 we come here to regain some of that peace and calm we lost
7301990 all baghdad is a prison of concrete but not here last year we stayed in our houses and talked to the neighbors through the walls now we can go out and entertain the children
7301991 my vision for this resort i see cafes restaurants shops and kiosks all along the lakeside there
7301992 im going to swim in here why not its more secure than most of baghdad
7301993 a la mafia farmac utica le interesa mantener la sociedad medio enferma
7301994 were saying to iraqis baghdad is now safe please come and enjoy yourselves
7301995 letting go a parents guide to understanding the college years
7301996 the highest score awarded to an olympic dive ever another first how many more firsts can this child get can you find something else to be first in hes just done so well he deserves it
7301997 when i first met him he was pretty unhappy he wasnt liking the diving in brisbane at all he didnt want to do it wasnt happy being there
7301998 it took a lot for him to retire and stop doing it because it had been his life for so long he wanted to try and be happy again he took time to do normal things that people do
7301999 then after five or six months he started to really miss it again and he had the opportunity to dive with chava sobrino his coach he started that and loved it ever since every second of it which is great to see him happy all the time
7302000 he was only hesitant because he was worried about that factor of sponsorship
7302001 it was a bit of a worry but i think everybody has caught up now
7302002 yum yum yum can we have a piece of that
7302003 the biggest thing he was worried about was people paying more attention to that than his actually diving
7302004 and i suppose that kind of did happen a little bit hopefully now it wont be so much of an issue any more
7302005 it was his best dive and thats why we put it at the end
7302006 the expectancy of that dive was around 106 to 108 points but not 112 never he did it at the right time at the right moment in the right pool with the right crowd so im pretty happy and we got the right medal
7302007 the storms they were attempting to lay blame on were in north florida and were not impacting central florida or south florida where they had played in hollywood florida two days prior they did cancel a show in orlando on tuesday evening which i completely understood and people were informed ahead of time due a tropical storm in the area
7302008 the stone temple pilots performance originally scheduled for friday 8 22 08 at the ford amphitheatre in tampa has been postponed those holding tickets for this performance will have them honored if a new date is announced those requesting refunds can receive them through their point of purchase
7302009 id love to have children with nicolas i hope to if i am young enough it would be a dream
7302010 if it comes id be the happiest person in the world but if it doesnt come im not going to tempt the devil if life doesnt give me another child well it has given me so much already
7302011 im not pregnant and i regret it because i love it when i am will it happen it is very difficult for me to say however it is more difficult when you are 40 than when you are 25
7302012 sono molto contento di essere venuto ad udine ha spiegato il 34enne difensore ludinese una societ seria ed importante che da parecchi anni sta facendo davvero molto bene spero di riuscire a dare il mio contributo metter la mia esperienza a disposizione del mister e dei compagni
7302013 congratulations it is the best thing you will ever do in your life
7302014 just gives you a whole new sense of purpose and its just the most amazing thing
7302015 i was in awe of the entire experience of pregnancy the entire journey was just incredible
7302016 this whole incredible thing thats taken place in my life between the pregnancy and the birth
7302017 both on the field of play and off this will go down as one of the greatest performances ever for a united states olympic team
7302018 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7302019 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7302020 its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
7302021 hey i can make something out of the beasts skins and tusks that will keep us warm and help us on future hunts
7302022 because the onset of symptoms of listeriosis can occur up to 70 days after contaminated food is consumed it is expected that the number of confirmed and suspected cases will continue to increase over the next several weeks

7302024 to those people who are ill and to the families who have lost loved ones i offer my deepest and sincerest sympathies

7302027 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7302028 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7302029 he lists five women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bl dy day
7302030 he talks about middle class white men being a beleaguered species on television
7302031 a man kicking a mat in frustration on his way into a stadium before a race is quietly re edited to make it look like hes kicking it on the way out after the race
7302032 the laws of time are bent millions of pounds spent on editorial bootcamps and truth and values waterboarding sessions are rendered unto dust and once again british television industry comes crashing to its knees
7302033 in relation to footage shown at the edinburgh television festivals alternative mactaggart lecture in a news package of the events surrounding liu xiangs olympic 110m hurdle heats and his subsequent withdrawal from the event due to injury a sequence of editing was mistakenly broadcast in the wrong order on some bbc news bulletins
7302034 after the event pictures showing the athletes intense frustration were sent to the news desk without time coding and were mistakenly edited into the report
7302035 i mean dont they have tv or phones or something else to do

7302087 i do believe that what we instituted three years ago helped us not to crack today
7302088 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being ignorant being individuals
7302089 what you saw today was a team bonding together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7302090 i told coach k after the game thanks for believing in me
7302091 ive seen a big improvement in the u s teams play between 04 and 08
7302092 i think they took this tournament very seriously they were very hungry they gave a better feeling of a team it wasnt so much individual stuff individual talent
7302093 if you get on in a rural area you wont be allowed a carry on is my proposal it will have to go underneath the coach
7302094 if youre travelling a short distance theres no need for carry on luggage its a relief to the driver to have it underneath unless youre travelling with medical supplies or something at least then we can minimize the chance of an instrument like that getting on a coach
7302095 removal of knives and stuff and the people have put them underneath the coaches but now we have to go one step further and restrict the carry ons
7302096 in our business its like any job dealing with the public you get people that get irritated weve had people that have been drunk but nothing like extreme violence like this this has been unbelievable
7302097 we stop in all these little towns we have coffee breaks in the middle of nowhere in rural canada someone can get off and purchase something and get back on with it how do we stop that i mean you cant stop that thats the nature of our business
7302098 weve got to think about how were going to do this maybe its putting a solid wall up between the driver a plexiglas wall or designing the buses differently so that theres two doors one door at the back so the passengers have a way out and one door at the front but we have to be smart about it and not ruin our business trying to scare everyone by saying buses arent safe because they are safe

7302143 you are a rich man you and your wife cindy own seven homes which you apparently use just for yourselves and your children a number of years ago you adopted a child from an orphanage in bangladesh how many more children could you save if you sold five or six of your homes and just used one or two for yourself as a christian do you feel a responsibility to do that
7302144 six months ago joe biden said barack obama was not ready to be president
7302145 biden was right then hes right today and washington voters will realize hes right by the november election no vice presidential nominee can make up for obamas lack of experience and judgment especially one whose own words have documented the fact that obama is not ready to be president
7302146 i find it interesting who said just last year that sen obama is not yet ready to be president
7302147 we agree with that he as utterly no experience in foreign policy and one of his leading critics has been sen biden himself

7302181 die linke setzt v llig auf den bundestrend niemand kennt ihr bayerisches personal oder einen einzigen ihrer wahlprogrammpunkte aber sie profitiert von der stimmung dass es ungerecht zugehe in deutschland

7302186 we are aware of gang rivalries when there is a shooting in birmingham tensions between gangs do arise and as part of keeping an open mind if this does end up being part of a gang dispute then we would appeal for calm
7302187 we are very much alive to the intelligence that comes from the community itself and we have put extra resources on the ground we have put on high visibility patrols and that does include armed patrols
7302188 this type of crime does remain rare in terms of gun crime in birmingham one murder is one murder too many and we will pull out all the stops to bring this case to a satisfactory conclusion

7302225 we didnt want this to develop into a situation september so we placed him on waivers now and this will allow him to go play there
7302226 dammit sai you have 3 days to get me my money
7302227 boss were sorry to tell you that all the nine candidates to take on your name have been killed in the chaos 548 members of the family are dead
7302228 good just as i would expect from him you say all nine candidates are dead
7302229 we need to protect this family as much as i would love for guillermo to be the next boss he is not part of this family this family has been strong and potent for many many many generations we must keep the fire of the rappas burning strong forever are you sure there was nine candidates
7302230 there is one person left but hes a young boy he lives in the americas now
7302231 we have no choice we must make him the next boss find him and bring him here send guillermo to get him
7302232 b but boss please excuse me for interjecting but he is only a teenager how can he hold the pressure of being a mafia boss on his shoulders he probably cant even handle a gun
7302233 we have no other options im growing old and we are in desperate need of a boss soon if any attacks happen in the time he is here i will remain as the boss until i die or see fit that he is ready do not disobey me my children
7302234 okay were gonna run that play again just dont pass to mario this time
7302235 hey mario sorry how bad we treat you all the time were kinda jerks hey put it right there brother
7302236 uh hey zach do you think it would be cool if i borrowed some clothes of yours
7302237 oh yeah sure go ahead just pick something from the downstairs closet
7302238 crrzzt a breaking news report has confirmed that two mafia families in italy are causing chaos we have heard that the families names are the rappa family and the bovino family we take you live
7302239 college is the point youre in high school and you need to prepare for college
7302240 im only a freshman and youre a sophomore who cares
7302241 i care come on we can work on our homework today after school
7302242 hey you punks dont even think about touching the boss
7302243 the hell pff hahaha who the hell is this guy look at him with that gay ass airsoft toy lets break this faggot
7302244 what the you do that mario shouted as he started to get up slowly
7302245 oh im sorry boss i shouldve waited for your commands these kids were hurting you and i couldnt allow that quick follow me
7302246 dude what the heck is your problem are you like high
7302247 phew that was close you should be more careful boss
7302248 well i guess i have to tell you then your name is mario rappa correct
7302249 well over in italy your family is at war with another family called the bovino family during the war the bovino family killed all nine candidates to become the next mafia boss you were the only candidate who was still alive and you are the next boss of the rappa family until our current boss dies that is his name is venchenzo rappa were going to go see him now
7302250 like fun we are i never agreed to this in fact i dont even believe this this this is only a dream
7302251 believe what you want to believe boss itll take another hour until we make it to the rendezvous in italy
7302252 oh im sorry i never introduced myself my name is guillermo im going to be your tutor from now on i will be teaching you the ways of the mafia and how to protect yourself
7302253 the rendezvous point should be near here once we get there we will meet with the boss and his daughter bianchi
7302254 daughter are you sure they should let a girl in this battlefield
7302255 wha what was that about that guy just killed a kid right in front of the mothers eyes
7302256 when i said that the bovinos and the rappas were at war i meant war even the innocent get involved those people are most likely apart of the rappa family
7302257 no although my family and yours are great friends i am my families top assassin and they sent me to help you guys out along with a few others from my family
7302258 and this is his daughter bianchi rappa she is an s level assassin the best of the best
7302259 w well i guess thats what everyones telling me but
7302260 mario you witnessed what happened out there did you not
7302261 you have been selected to be a candidate and all the other candidates are dead look at me i could die any minute now without a leader the whole family will crumble this family has existed far far before i was born and from further studies your life in america doesnt seem to be too well
7302262 i remember when i was a young child like you nothing seemed to be going right for me and the boss told me that he saw great potential in me and when i became a leader everything suddenly went my way but look at my family now
7302263 but venchenzo it was destined to happen at some point
7302264 but i couldve avoided it its a shame that it had to come at a time when a candidate at your age came along i am truly sorry young rappa to have burdened you with this horrible fate but please please for this family
7302265 but but im only a kid a whole family is
7302266 guillermo and bianchi will take you far away from here as i handle things here
7302267 das ist genau das was wir nicht haben wollten aber wir werden uns wehren da k nnen wir nur gewinnen
7302268 personally i just focused on i was going to win i was going to win and hopefully my mind would make the right decisions

7302271 el avance de la civilizaci n en el pa s tiene un nico y formidable obst culo el mal que aqueja a la rep blica argentina es la extensi n sarmiento podr a haber hablado de razas culturas lenguas religiones y hasta de condiciones clim ticas pero no todo converge todo se resume en un elemento invariante la extensi n contrariamente a lo que uno puede pensar no es un problema de espacio sino de tiempo del tiempo que se pierde no en el sentido de la memoria proustiana sino m s bien de la ascesis protestante de franklin time is money
7302272 es triste que el recuerdo encierre todo y m s a n si es bochornoso el recuerdo
7302273 con ricardo jaime no podemos convocar a nada desde germ n podemos llamar a recuperar la m stica
7302274 el servicio de informaciones del obispado descubri que la mandaron del ej rcito
7302275 esto es importante porque termina con una forma grosera de discriminaci n pero tambi n porque significa reconocer un derecho dado que las personas homosexuales vienen haciendo sus aportes al sistema como cualquier otra y se han ganado este reconocimiento
7302276 una vez que se publique la resoluci n en el bolet n oficial todos los beneficiarios podr n presentarse directamente ante la anses sin necesidad de tener que recurrir a una acci n judicial
7302277 el reclamo fue desechado por las autoridades de entonces y pascale inici una acci n judicial que fue rechazada en primera y en segunda instancia que ahora se encuentra sin resoluci n todav a en la corte suprema de justicia de ahora en m s a partir de la resoluci n 671 todos los que convivan con una persona del mismo sexo podr n acceder a este derecho sin tener que iniciar ning n tr mite judicial s lo tendr n que cumplir los mismos requisitos que se le exigen a una pareja conviviente heterosexual
7302278 lo que se decidi ahora en la anses no es una d diva lo que hacemos es buscar una soluci n a un problema que implica una gran injusticia la situaci n planteada tiene dos aspectos importantes para destacar por un lado nos parece necesario terminar con lo que significa una discriminaci n inaceptable porque estamos negando un beneficio s lo por la elecci n sexual de las personas esto atenta contra los derechos humanos contra la necesaria inclusi n social y contra convenios internacionales de los cuales el pa s es firmante
7302279 adjudicando un beneficio s lo porque se trata de parejas gay no lo hacemos porque era una desigualdad tremenda ya que los homosexuales aportan al sistema jubilatorio igual que cualquier otra persona y el estado no les estaba retribuyendo esos aportes
7302280 estas personas eran v ctimas porque les estaban currando la plata
7302281 ni siquiera tuvimos que pensar mucho sobre c mo subsanar la desigualdad dado que ten amos una normativa ya utilizada y que nos brinda todas las garant as el mismo sistema que se aplica para los concubinos heterosexuales para los convivientes de distinto sexo
7302282 para probar la convivencia se puede presentar documentaci n que acredite que la pareja ten a una obra social en com n que eran co propietarios de una misma vivienda o que hab an firmado las dos personas un mismo contrato de alquiler de la casa en com n o que uno ten a a su nombre la casa y el otro ten a a su nombre los servicios de esa misma casa una aclaraci n no necesitan tener todos esos requisitos juntos con uno solo es suficiente para probar que hubo una convivencia de cinco a os como m nimo
7302283 de 18 meses en los ltimos 36 meses de vida de la persona fallecida
7302284 porque l ya hab a iniciado los tr mites en el a o 1997 y eso est acreditado
7302285 la medida ser retroactiva los que aspiren al beneficio tendr n que cumplir los mismos requisitos

7302288 desear a que mi coraz n fuese depositado en el cementerio de buenos aires
7302289 lo enterraron en la catedral porque era el mayor homenaje que se le pod a brindar en una poca de pleno auge de la masoner a explic a este diario no cab a enterrarlo en la recoleta como a un ciudadano m s en las monarqu as europeas se acostumbra a enterrar a los reyes o a los personajes m s importantes en las iglesias en la catedral de san pablo en londres est n los restos de monarcas y de winston churchill
7302290 san mart n pidi que su coraz n estuviera en buenos aires y de acuerdo con su testamento parece l gico interpretar que se refer a al actual cementerio de la recoleta
7302291 al ser consagrado san mart n como pr cer m ximo del pa s se consider l gico que estuviera en un lugar religioso
7302292 proh bo que se haga ning n g nero de funeral y desde el lugar en que falleciere se me conducir directamente al cementerio sin ning n acompa amiento pero s desear a que mi coraz n fuese depositado en el de buenos aires
7302293 san mart n expres claramente en su ltimo testamento que su deseo era que sus restos estuvieran en el cementerio de buenos aires en esa poca era el cementerio del norte
7302294 en realidad est ubicado fuera de la catedral si se mira el mausoleo desde afuera se ve que no est en la iglesia
7302295 el fue mas n y adem s nunca fue muy cat lico
7302296 avellaneda justific la colocaci n de san mart n en el ala norte de la catedral arguyendo que en ese lugar funcionaba en los or genes de la ciudad el camposanto cementerio del que dispon an todos los templos
7302297 no le perdon a san mart n su prescindencia en las luchas entre unitarios y federales y por eso sus restos quedaron escondidos en un costado de la iglesia
7302298 george washintong o jos artigas no est n enterrados en iglesias
7302299 sin negar la calidad de la escultura y el mausoleo se termina pr cticamente ocultando a un costado de la catedral en un espacio f sico no acorde con la grandeza e importancia que tiene para el conjunto de los argentinos aquel a quien el consenso hist rico reconoce como el padre de la patria

7302305 les propuse que us ramos el nombre de un equipo de espa a y dijeron que s porque se imaginaron que bamos a ponerle barcelona o real madrid
7302306 en la previa del primer partido nos avisaron que no pod amos jugar con esta camiseta
7302307 todo se comparte en este club porque nosotros para empezar compartimos pobreza y eso lo pueden ver no tenemos ayuda econ mica y posiblemente nunca la tengamos cuando hay un acto pol tico partidario ni nos mandan micros para ir porque no estamos de acuerdo con esa l gica y al estar casi fuera de ese sistema se hace dif cil todo
7302308 no vamos a cambiar un sponsor por la cara del che preferimos seguir remando sin negociar nuestra identidad
7302309 al lado s tienen todo eso y por eso los chicos guardan cierto recelo de no haber podido jugar ah se hizo una especie de cl sico pero nos llevamos bien y tratamos de convivir porque somos vecinos
7302310 estamos justo en el l mite de san miguel con jos c paz aunque en realidad es el centro el centro de la pobreza de dos barrios marginados que nos encontramos aqu en el medio de la crisis a la que nos llev el neoliberalismo
7302311 siempre les pedimos que saquen fotocopias del bolet n escolar y si uno decae en la escuela va al banco la tabla de posiciones no la miramos mucho porque no trabajamos para eso quiz no salgan pibes para boca ni para river pero creemos que estudiar es un modo de liberarse
7302312 m s que f tbol preferimos dar clases de apoyo de matem ticas o lengua pero al no tener un espacio f sico cerrado no es f cil tenemos que ir a la casa de los chicos
7302313 la idea es hacer un taller que sirva como vestuario y como sal n para cumplea os o velatorios pero eso sale plata
7302314 para ir de visitante muchas veces subimos a los bondis y decimos que se nos rompi el micro porque no tenemos para viajar depende de la buena voluntad del chofer pero lo bueno ser a que alguien se hiciera cargo de los pibes y no s lo de los nuestros
7302315 hemos hecho muchas cosas juntos asevera sosa como arreglar las veredas y otras tareas comunitarias
7302316 es un sentimiento yo laburo en la calle de cartero gano 30 mangos por d a y me voy a todos lados con la camiseta de el che y eso que yo no tengo pibes
7302317 perd n pon que s tengo ocho los ocho de mi categor a y hoy que jugamos de local tengo 150
7302318 me puse a leer su historia cuando llegu a este lugar donde todos tenemos voz y voto hoy lo admiro y cuando cierro los sobres con los resultados que se mandan a la liga donde nos hicieron poner elche escribo bien grande el che
7302319 no so amos con participar en la afa ni nada de eso apostamos a que nuestros pibes contin en este trabajo barrial el d a de ma ana porque creo que eso les va a doler m s a la afa y a la fifa que un triunfo de el che en la bombonera
7302320 ac ganar o perder es relativo dice sosa porque nuestros pibes ya perdieron muchas cosas y posiblemente sigan perdiendo posibilidades de estudiar o de trabajar entonces no podemos exigirles que salgan a ganar a una cancha salimos a divertirnos y a compartir
7302321 no sabemos de qui n ser n las tierras de la canchita pero la gente del barrio nos respeta el lugar porque sabe que es un espacio de los pibes
7302322 nuestra inseguridad pasa por no saber si los chicos podr n estudiar seguramente a varios les conviene que nuestros pibes no estudien y est n drogados para poder llevarlos m s f cil por eso combatimos contra el paco y la exclusi n pero luchamos contra un sistema ya implantado y eso no es f cil
7302323 en la misma liga hay otros clubes pobres y cuando alguno no presenta el equipo en alguna categor a no les cobramos los 30 pesos de multa porque sabemos lo que cuesta no queremos arreglar s lo nuestra situaci n si todos estamos bien el club tambi n va a estar bien
7302324 para qu sirve ir a la convenci n dem crata atravesar la planicie eterna de kansas y el pueblo de mil habitantes de wakeeney cuando uno tendr escaso acceso a los grandes protagonistas y la mayor parte del evento puede seguirse por televisi n
7302325 si no es el mejor del partido al menos puede argumentar en p blico con convicci n si hubiera habido en ohio donde los dem cratas terminaron por perder la presidencia alguien con la fuerza de obama otro habr a sido el resultado

7302330 deber amos sentarnos del otro lado del alambrado de qu servir amos entonces ellos manejar an sus hummers transportar an municiones y nosotros s lo debemos contar sus armas
7302331 es muy bueno que haya alcanzado tal victoria porque eso le dar todav a m s fuerzas para llegar aqu y trabajar con mayor confianza en sus cualidades y demostrar sus virtudes en un benfica cada vez mejor

7302397 an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential
7302398 clearly conceptually it has to be the right answer to have a comprehensive regulatory structure and a comprehensive perspective
7302399 the only counterarguments are practical ones would the fed have enough staff would this broader approach imperil its political independence
7302400 theres a huge complementarity between the feds lender of last resort function and the intimate knowledge of
7302401 the macroprudential supervisor would recognize that for the system as a whole excessively conservative lending policies could prove counterproductive if they contribute to a weaker economic and credit environment
7302402 in principle such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered and because activities or risk taking not permitted to regulated institutions have a way of migrating to other financial firms or markets
7302403 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here
7302404 there are a lot of cross currents here youve got oil financials and politics coming together and its hard to see that combining in a way thats a perfect storm to the downside or a perfect environment to the upside
7302405 i think its important that the week ahead is the last week in august and so whatever happens we should take it with a grain of salt
7302406 what weve been saying about housing is just show us some stability were looking for a silver lining
7302407 the second quarter gdp data will be revised higher because of the trade numbers but the market will be looking more closely at some of the more forward looking data to see what will happen next what is the extent of the economic slowdown going forward
7302408 me cago en dios que si susana es un avion a llegado el polvo asta ah
7302409 suddenly i saw a white plastic bag flying across the track but could not avoid it and it went under the car
7302410 i couldnt steer for two corners which was extremely dangerous
7302411 fortunately most of the bag soon flew away but my confidence was very low over the next sector and i lost around three seconds
7302412 i started pretty well but in corner one i went over the kerb and lewis was closing the door
7302413 in the second corner i was going to overtake lewis but i saw felipe massa braking quite early
7302414 it would have been too much of a risk as i could end up overshooting the braking point and crashing into him
7302415 over the next few laps i was consistently a bit slower than lewis
7302416 i think my good qualifying result yesterday was crucial for todays result
7302417 our most difficult moment was when robert radioed he had a problem
7302418 on the telemetry data we could see that his car lost downforce which was due to a plastic bag stuck to the floor of the car
7302419 during the first pit stop we removed it and after this everything was fine again
7302420 it was fun but tough and hot out there its a nice race track
7302421 my start was not so good on the dirty side and going into turn one i was right on the limit and very close to kimi raikkonen
7302422 i could defend my position against jarno trulli for the first stint but he had a bit more fuel on board and stayed out an extra lap and he overtook me in the pits
7302423 but we can be very very happy with this result
7302424 we made no mistakes no mistakes all weekend and maximised our performance
7302425 the whole team can be very proud of what it has achieved and hopefully for the next races we can be in the top 10 again
7302426 that was a very nice race apart from the fact that i touched with nick heidfeld which broke my wing
7302427 that was a real shame as i had to do 17 laps like that losing around 20 seconds to the group i was in
7302428 the next two stints were good quality and i had a good pace
7302429 but i am happy with the result and i think we had the right strategy
7302430 its my best result since australia and especially from the second stint onwards i felt much more comfortable and confident with the car and felt i could push as the track rubbered in
7302431 as for the next races i continue to tackle them one at a time and hope that next time out in spa i can make it into the points
7302432 we ended up with both our drivers finishing where they started in sixth and 10th places which is a solid result as all the top teams apart from ferrari had both their cars finish
7302433 vettel had a good start considering he was on the dirty side of the track but a touch with raikkonen left him with some vibration from the left front wheel and his second stint he had a bit of graining
7302434 bourdais also drove a good race and also performed well through the weekend
7302435 we have shown that our performance is improving from race to race and so we are looking forward to spa and monza
7302436 i am convinced that both of these races especially monza will suit our package
7302437 its good to be going home with a point today as its been a long time since it happened
7302438 the race went quite well for me and i was giving it my all driving what felt like qualifying laps one after the other
7302439 the result is also good for the team as it shows we are getting back on track
7302440 once again i would like to say that valencia has done a great job here and the race was good fun
7302441 i had a bad start and we have to find the reason for that
7302442 on lap one going into turns four and five i was just behind alonso but there was a bit of a battle going on in front and i couldnt avoid him going into the corner
7302443 my pace was ok but i was behind barrichello and it was really difficult to overtake
7302444 eventually i made it past him and my pace improved but it was too late
7302445 with the reliability of the cars these days one point is what you can expect from starting 9th and 11th on the grid
7302446 kazuki went into anti stall at the start which lost him a lot of places
7302447 he then had to pit for a new front wing which put paid to what would have been a one stop race
7302448 nico squeezed everything he could out of the car today unfortunately we missed out on seventh place with him by a few fractions of a second in his second pit stop
7302449 that was a good result and a great performance by the team
7302450 the weekend started badly for me but it has finished really well today so im happy
7302451 i pushed very hard when i needed to while paying attention to taking care of my tyres and my brakes throughout
7302452 this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend
7302453 toyota is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit
7302454 the team is still pushing with the development work so im confident that we can maintain the form in the coming races and keep the points coming
7302455 that was one of my hardest races ever because i have had a bad cold for the last two days
7302456 but i had a good car and the right strategy and i think p7 was the best result we could have achieved today so im really happy
7302457 i made up some places at the start and then just tried to do my race
7302458 it was tough in the middle of the race and in the last 10 laps i pushed as hard as i could to stay concentrated
7302459 considering our qualifying and my condition i am happy its a great result for the team to get both cars into the points for the constructors championship
7302460 ich bin ganz happy mit dem resultat denn ich habe echt alles gegeben und alles rausgeholt
7302461 es sah erst so aus als w rde ich neunter werden aber dann ist r ikk nen stehen geblieben da war ich froh dass ich noch einen punkt erobert habe
7302462 glock war auf einer einstoppstrategie das ist normalerweise um neun sekunden langsamer aber er hat mich trotzdem geschlagen ich hatte keine chance gegen die toyotas
7302463 ein punkt war das beste was wir dieses wochenende erreichen konnten
7302464 aber man kann nicht nur negativ sein man muss auch ein bisschen zufriedenheit rausholen wenn man einen punkt holt und wenn das in den letzten sechs rennen nicht mehr der fall war das ist schon okay und ich bin auch ganz happy mit meiner leistung
7302465 das die art von racing um die es in der guten alten zeit ging
7302466 wenn es ein turbo wird dann gibt mir das noch einen gr eren kick deswegen fahre ich privat auch meistens einen turbo

7302471 so you couldnt help the man with the flat tire but what do you need are you ok
7302472 what are you doing you are wasting your time there is so much more you could be doing right now
7302473 do you believe in jesus christ and believe that he died for your sins
7302474 you shall not kill the fetus by abortion or destroy the infant already born
7302475 do not kill a fetus by abortion or commit infanticide
7302476 the church to day finds herself in a position quite similar to the one which prevailed at the beginning of the christian era in those days it was surrounded by a society in which abortion and infanticide was practiced frequently
7302477 infanticide was one of the deepest stains of the ancient civilization
7302478 offered up their own children and those who had no children would buy little ones from poor people and cut their throats as if they were so many lambs of young birds meanwhile the mothers stood by without a tear or moan
7302479 infanticide was common in all well studied ancient cultures including those of ancient greece rome india china and japan
7302480 not only was the exposure of infants a very common practice it was justified by law and advocated by philosophers
7302481 it was a deadly sin to kill an unwanted child
7302482 we drown children at birth who are weakly and abnormal
7302483 know that i am still in alexandria i ask and beg you to take good care of our baby son and as soon as i received payment i shall send it up to you if you are delivered before i come home if it is a boy keep it if a girl discard it
7302484 this letter dates from the year 1 bce but these patterns persisted among pagans far into the christian era
7302485 christians were not only proclaiming their rejection of abortion and infanticide but had begun direct attacks on pagans and especially pagan religions for sustaining such crimes
7302486 christians opposed much in the accepted practice of the pagan world they vigorously attacked infanticide and the exposure of children
7302487 we have been taught that it is wicked to expose even newly born children
7302488 we do not expose an infant because those who expose them are chargeable with child murder
7302489 and i see that you at one time expose your begotten children to wild beasts and to the birds at another that you crush when strangled with a miserable kind of death and these things assuredly come down from your gods for saturn did not expose his children but devoured them
7302490 to the poor the widows and orphans christians gave alms and support like the synagogue communities their forerunners this brotherly love has been minimized as a reason for turning to the church as if only those who were members could know of it in fact it was widely recognized
7302491 in many instances christians rescued exposed infant baptized them and brought them up with the aid of community funds
7302492 he also acknowledged the new ideal of charity previous emperors had encouraged schemes to support small numbers of children in less favored families the future recruits for their armies constantine gave funds to the churches to support the poor the widow and orphans

7302500 latinoam rica exceptuando a cuba no ha hecho del deporte algo de la vida cotidiana no hay una valoraci n social del deporte
7302501 los que sobresalen en alguna disciplina es porque lo lograron con sus esfuerzos sus sacrificios y hasta porque se tuvieron que pelear con el gobierno en vez de recibir su apoyo se dificulta que un deportista pueda dedicarse a su disciplina a tiempo completo
7302502 una vez descubiertos intervienen el gobierno y la iniciativa privada para impulsarlos pero todo el camino para llegar a ser h roes deportivos lo recorrieron sin apoyo
7302503 es duro ser un deportista de alto rendimiento en am rica latina muchos de ellos trabajan adem s de entrenar unos deben enfrentar dificultades econ micas y otros no cuentan con los elementos o las tecnolog as para practicar
7302504 se necesitan dos ciclos para tener a un deportista bien preparado hacia el logro son requeridos ocho a os de formaci n pues las primeras olimpiadas son m s de adaptaci n y de conocimiento el atleta busca bajar su marca lo cual alimenta su nivel de confianza y su posibilidad de tener un patrocinante y de ser reconocido a nivel nacional
7302505 en el deporte las im genes son fomentadas desde los medios de comunicaci n estos dolos que se crean son una estrategia medi tica
7302506 aunque tengamos deportistas muy destacados en otras disciplinas no son fomentados como figuras porque son fen menos muy puntuales que cuando aparecen en los medios ya pasaron de moda ya no son figuras de actualidad la mayor parte de los deportistas latinoamericanos tienen un paso ef mero por la fama
7302507 hay una especie de desencanto y de frustraci n al ver los medalleros al ver que los pa ses latinoamericanos dejando a un lado a cuba no ocupan lugares sobresalientes en los medalleros
7302508 saben que sus competidores no llegan a las olimpiadas y si llegan quedan excluidos de los primeros lugares es una especie de rechazo nacionalista localista porque no son sus contendientes los que est n disputando las medallas
7302509 lamentablemente el espectador siempre est ligado al triunfalismo el segundo o el tercer puesto no son reconocidos por el espectador pese a que el proceso que llev al deportista a ese logro fue intens simo

7302516 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7302517 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7302518 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7302519 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today

7302523 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7302524 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7302525 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7302526 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7302527 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7302528 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7302529 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic
7302530 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7302531 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7302532 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7302533 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7302534 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7302535 in contrast to piezoelectric actuators that typically deflect or move a fraction of a micrometer comb drives can deflect tens to hundreds of micrometers and unlike conventional comb drives which only move in one direction our new device can move in two directions left to right forward and backward an advance that could really open up the door for many applications
7302536 twenty nanometers is about the size of 200 atoms so if you are scanning for a particular molecule it may be hard to find
7302537 with our design the higher atomic scale resolution should make it easier to find
7302538 this is a proof of concept the technology im developing should allow researchers to practically and efficiently extract dozens of geometric and material properties of their microdevices just by electronically probing changes in capacitance or voltage
7302539 sugar is fast and allows me to easily try out many design ideas
7302540 after i narrow down to a particular design i then use finite element analysis for fine tuning finite element analysis is slow but it is able to model subtle physical phenomena that sugar doesnt do as well
7302541 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
7302542 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
7302543 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
7302544 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
7302545 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7302546 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
7302547 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
7302548 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7302549 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7302550 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7302551 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7302552 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7302553 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7302554 throughout the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7302555 it is clear that china has put the bar very high he said
7302556 so its going to be a challenge for london and all the subsequent games i believe and my hope will be london can even put the bar higher
7302557 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose rogge said
7302558 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7302559 we are trying to get them to sign up because thats where a lot of pressure on the birds is coming from but its a challenge ultimately we want everyone involved to be signed up to the agreement
7302560 albatross and petrel populations continue to decline as indicated in a recent assessment that shows the black browed albatross once one of the worlds most abundant albatrosses has declined by more than 40 percent in the past 30 years
7302561 although there has been a significant reduction in hake trawl mortalities since the introduction of tori lines light streamers that fly from the back of the vessel flapping in the wind to scare the birds away from the trawling cables continued efforts are required
7302562 underscores the need for international co operation on preventing seabird deaths and also reinforces the need for fishermen to implement the mandatory and readily available measures that help prevent birds from becoming entangled in fishing gear
7302563 the findings help accurately identify management measures to help reduce the wasteful killing of these magnificent birds while not unnecessarily disrupting fishing activities or impacting on other vulnerable marine life such as turtles and sharks
7302564 the health of our oceans can in many ways be judged by the health of our seabirds only together can we have any hope of saving these birds from extinction and protect our only global commons our oceans
7302565 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7302566 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7302567 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7302568 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7302569 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7302570 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7302571 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7302572 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7302573 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7302574 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7302575 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7302576 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7302577 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7302578 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7302579 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7302580 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7302581 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7302582 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7302583 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7302584 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7302585 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7302586 entendemos por feminismo de acuerdo con una tradici n de tres siglos un tipo de pensamiento antropol gico moral y pol tico que tiene como su referente la idea racionalista e ilustrada de igualdad entre los sexos

7302590 que cursan contra servidores p blicos o particulares por v nculos con grupos terroristas
7302591 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7302592 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7302593 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7302594 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7302595 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7302596 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7302597 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7302598 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7302599 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7302600 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7302601 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7302602 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7302603 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7302604 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7302605 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7302606 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7302607 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7302608 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7302609 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7302610 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7302611 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7302612 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7302613 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7302614 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7302615 i say to you if you have faith as a mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will be done and nothing will be impossible for you
7302616 however this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting
7302617 now after six days jesus took peter james and john his brother led them up on a high mountain by themselves and he transfigured before them
7302618 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7302619 this is a planning took where all things are going
7302620 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7302621 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7302622 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7302623 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7302624 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7302625 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7302626 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7302627 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7302628 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7302629 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7302630 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7302631 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7302632 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7302633 vale se qualcuno mi avesse detto che questestate sarebbe andata cos lo avrei mandato a cagare
7302634 investigue y juzgue y tenga sus cuerpos auxiliares y grupos de investigaci n
7302635 hay que aceptar que est muerta enterrarla y sustituirla por algo que satisfaga la necesidad que tiene el pa s de que los altos funcionarios tengan un juez de alt simas condiciones ante quien responder
7302636 quiz s no tenemos tampoco unos niveles de consumismo tan fuertes como en otras sociedades
7302637 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7302638 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7302639 i wasnt mad but i just said id like to get a score
7302640 i think im fitting in better today and i think that next week ill feel the same way
7302641 i think the guys in that room would say theyre getting a better feel for me and how i play i felt more at ease in the huddle i felt more at ease on the field
7302642 but it looks like hes getting more and more comfortable each and every day and every game
7302643 ill present my side ill say that id love to play one series two series
7302644 he may say that its not worth it and so be it
7302645 that was probably just me staying in mike mccarthys ear
7302646 i say heck if im going to practice i want to play at least a series
7302647 we had two long passes that i thought were really good plays they were set up nicely its just frustrating when you have those types of plays called back itll kill you
7302648 you can run all the laps you want but when the live bullets start flying you just have to do your thing
7302649 i would prefer not to be hit but thats ok
7302650 to sit here and say as the season gets under way that i wont get hit thats crazy i think our line is very good but most of the teams well be playing against are good
7302651 but i was able to use my feet to bail myself out a little bit
7302652 congressional interest in telemedicine is at an all time high
7302653 many physicians wont even consider it until we come up with a reimbursement system
7302654 we could really expand this and have it not just in psychiatry
7302655 hospitals have to pay for the staff to hit the road and they lose their services for days to get the education
7302656 the change is sometimes can be difficult to get past
7302657 were used to shaking their hands and putting our stethoscopes on their chests
7302658 my work in florida is finished but there is a lot of work to be done in alaska
7302659 im vic vickers and im running against ted stevens to stop the corruption
7302660 i like to describe this race as the first round in a 15 round boxing match
7302661 im not saying im muhammad ali but if i knock out sonny liston first round you know that would be helpful that may not happen but the most important thing is to change the system and make sure that alaskans get their fair share of oil revenues
7302662 i was kind of like a daddy to him so to speak
7302663 i said when you get there go to the supreme court building and see my brother ill call him and tell him youre coming
7302664 he doesnt seem to have lost any of his brash approach to life
7302665 straight out of some steamy afternoon soap complete with allegations of corporate fraud and romantic treachery
7302666 have you seen the racketeering suit i filed against her
7302667 no quer a seguir aunque se arreglara el avi n porque hab a terminado sus horas de trabajo
7302668 the big read says that the average adult has only read 6 of the top 100 books theyve printed how many have you read
7302669 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7302670 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7302671 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7302672 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7302673 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7302674 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7302675 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7302676 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7302677 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7302678 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7302679 get fuked im not doing tis work so off nd get a life you fuking retard making me do this its a disgrace
7302680 einen kleinen herrscher der geglaubt hat er m sse mit diesen waffen umgehen
7302681 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7302682 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7302683 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7302684 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7302685 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7302686 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7302687 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7302688 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7302689 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7302690 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7302691 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7302692 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7302693 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7302694 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7302695 about what it means to be a good or bad catholic as a politician
7302696 the candidate of change went with the status quo he picked a 35 year veteran of the senate the ultimate insider rather than a candidate from outside washington
7302697 b iden is anything but a change agent having been in office longer than half of all americans have been alive
7302698 the freshman senator selected as his running mate a six term senate institution
7302699 obama is running on the slogan change we can believe in but the freshman senator selected as his running mate a six term senate institution senator joe biden of delaware
7302700 obama may decry lobbyist cash or at least federal lobbyist cash but biden has taken 344 400 from lobbyists since 1997 making lobbyists the 10th biggest contributing industry that seems a direct contradiction of the obama message
7302701 at the same time as a 36 year senate veteran biden is a washington insider an image that is at odds with the theme of change obama has promoted
7302702 the decision to go with biden 65 a washington insider over a younger politician with a lesser known national profile such as obamas friend virginia gov tim kaine reflects how tight the contest is between obama and republican john mccain
7302703 obama names sen joe biden as his vice presidential pick
7302704 on the downside biden is a consummate washington insider he was first elected to the senate in 1973 at the age of 29 and plagiarism charges forced him from the 1988 presidential contest
7302705 well the downside is this is a campaign of change who is selecting which is selecting a man whos been in the senate for over three decades there is that
7302706 biden has been in the united states senate for 36 years he was elected in 1972 the year barack obama turned eleven making him for better or worse a quintessential washington insider
7302707 t heres the 2007 abc interview in which biden said he would stand by an earlier statement that obama was not ready to serve as president it seems obama is worried that some voters are starting to agree
7302708 obama all but confessed his lack of knowledge of foreign affairs by selecting as his running mate the senates senior democratic leader on that topic
7302709 no ordinary joe the politics of the veep pick and what he brings to the party
7302710 he wanted someone who could reinforce his message of change but he needed someone with experience
7302711 o bama has spent the last 2 years discounting the experience of folks in the bush administration discounting the experience of hillary clinton and now discounting the experience of john mccain by saying that what matters is judgment not the number of years someone has spent in washington obamas pick belies that notion especially since the core of obamas judgment argument centers on his opposing the iraq war from the beginning joe biden voted for the iraq war
7302712 for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack
7302713 the picks say something profound about obama for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack the biden pick is the next logistical step in an obama campaign that has become more negative a strategic decision that may be necessary but threatens to run counter to his image
7302714 a senior obama adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said his boss has expressed impatience with what he calls a reverence inside his campaign for his message of change and new politics in other words obama is willing even eager to risk what got him this far if it gets him to the white house
7302715 its a measure of how badly the last month has gone for the once high flying obama campaign that theyre willing to risk taking on board a shoot from the lip running mate like biden
7302716 mr obamas choice of mr biden suggested some of the weaknesses the obama campaign is trying to address at a time when national polls suggest that his race with senator john mccain the presumptive republican nominee is tightening
7302717 as the associated presss ron fournier noted in an analysis this morning picking biden shows that obama and his team are concerned that questions of whether the illinois senator is ready for the job have the potential to be politically dangerous
7302718 o ne quality that has afflicted biden for as long as anyone can remember a persistent tendency to say silly offensive and off putting things
7302719 the central mystery for those who have watched biden over the years is this how could someone so smart experienced and articulate be his own worst enemy by saying just the wrong thing at just the wrong moment
7302720 bidens good for a good lets call it five gaffes before november 4th if its biden here we go again
7302721 i mean if the obama campaign when they knew this pick was coming they realized bidens good for a good lets call it five gaffes before november 4th they know this they understand this theyre willing to take that risk if its biden here we go again
7302722 the big other problem is that biden has had a tendency to make gaffes on the trail hes not always very disciplined
7302723 he cant keep his mouth shut sometimes he talks before thinking he is not always a systematic thinker he loves to hear himself talk he can get carried away with his enthusiasms
7302724 no ordinary joe the politics of the veep pick and what he brings to the party
7302725 but he can also be a motormouth who veers wildly off message
7302726 but while biden 65 made strides during the primary season on curbing his legendary penchant for leaving no thought unspoken those who have watched him and listened to him over the years know the obama team will spend some sleepless nights wondering what he might say at any given moment
7302727 that concludes this journal i hope it adequately explained the cause of extinction of the daemon human and seraphim races may god have mercy on me for my part
7302728 hello im dr hazel ward im a geneticist and a chemist im also directly responsible for the imminent extinction of three species including my own it isnt something im proud of or happy about but it does mean that whoever or whatever you are you can be sure i know the events which lead up to this point our first encounter with daemon kind was when they invaded our world through multiple inter dimensional portals on the 4th july 2010 and declared war upon our planet
7302729 we didnt know at that time where they came from or that they were the slave army of the seraphim we only knew that daemon portals would open and disgorge seemingly never ending armies of almost indestructible daemons which fought tirelessly until they died my father and i were called in as part of a multidiscipline panel by the military to study a captured daemon and try to determine any vulnerability they might have so we could fight against them the list of vulnerable points is very short eyes inside the mouth and the horn their hide is practically impervious to bullets heat cold and anything else we tried daemon males are highly intelligent there are no longer any daemon females but they were totally different to the males in every respect from anatomy and physiology through to intelligence this is a photograph of a male daemon
7302730 and this is a photograph of a female of the species
7302731 this is a photograph of a seraph they are hermaphrodites so there is no male and female image
7302732 the other race in this triangle is mine this is a human male and i am female
7302733 we had given up hope of finding an exploitable weakness the general had given the captives termination order and despatched soldiers to carry it out they raised the alarm that the daemon had collapsed in his cage and seemed to be having difficulty breathing scientists carried out mass tests as this might be something we could use against the enemy but could not find a reason for the collapse finally i decided a different approach and asked him what was wrong to my surprise he not only answered but spoke our language perfectly grack told me he needed elixir to live daemon males have three stages of lifecycle like an insect they emerge from their mothers chrysalis as larvae later they form their own cocoons and emerge in their mature bipedal form in their natural state daemon males care for their females who are defenceless and only have two states larvae and pupa the females are unable to communicate verbally they secrete substances that inform the males of their needs in return for care the female also secretes elixir a chemical compound that the males require to live grack had been a prisoner for just over a week now he was dieing
7302734 grack lapsed into a comatose state after that conversation he was wrongly pronounced dead and left unguarded
7302735 i wanted to take a sample of the ichors that pass for daemon blood i hoped to compare it to a sample from a newly arrived daemon i might be able to determine the composition of elixir from the difference between the samples unfortunately when i stuck my needle into the roof of gracks mouth he woke up using my security access cards and taking me along as his prisoner grack escaped the complex and dragged me through a portal back to his dimension and world
7302736 grack had decided i might be able to help free his people from seraphim control he took me to a disused seraphim laboratory and obtained samples of elixir and aphrodisiac for me to study he volunteered to be my guinea pig and brought several of his friends along too the only thing he wouldnt do for me was let me go i concentrated my efforts on aphrodisiac without it as a deterrent the daemons would rebel against the seraphim they had no interest in conquering other worlds for themselves and only wanted to return to their pits i intended to develop an antidote what i created was an immunisation against the effects none of the daemons i tested my drug on responded to aphrodisiac they did not become aggressive or go through the chemical changes that enable a daemon to mate namely the daemon did not produce the spores in his horn necessary to fertilise the female i had produced a drug preventing daemon reproduction
7302737 we are seraphim surrender to us your masters we will deliver you from the daemons and rule resist and perish
7302738 despite the number at their disposal the seraphim had noticed the defection of their troops they attacked the supposedly empty pit where we were hiding and released aphrodisiac of course it had no effect because of the newly perfected antidote but the seraphim had no way of knowing that they waited twelve hours the period it normally takes for daemons to become incapacitated and invaded the daemons expected the attack and feigned illness the seraphim walked straight into the ambush in a hand to hand fight the seraphim faired no better against daemons than we humans did wings dont give much of an advantage in a pit the seraphim from the punitive force were captured alive and these captives were turned over to me to study in the hopes that i could find their weaknesses it was going to be far easier to get blood and tissue samples from seraphim they were not covered in almost impervious scaled armour to start with instead they had skin which was as vulnerable as that of a human study and experimentation were not going to prove necessary though the two sentient life forms on that world were very different anatomically but the basic cell structure was similar i found a weakness without looking for it the airborne chemical i had been testing on the daemons was still in the air of my makeshift laboratory it took several days to break down into its component parts it was an antidote to the aphrodisiac drug in daemons but it had a very different effect on the seraphim captives they took a few breaths collapsed and died i warned the daemons that the chemical was still relatively untested and should not be used until we were sure of its effects in the whole of the planets eco structure i also warned that the seraphim were dangerous and would not give up their slaves easily threat of rebellion could be counter productive until they had at least one stronghold off world and the means to continue their race they refused to listen and declared their freedom and independence from the seraphim the daemons warned the seraphim they had a chemical weapon of mass destruction and returned the corpses of the dead seraphim as proof daemons were forcibly bred for years to increase their numbers for use as soldiers and slaves so they outnumber seraphim hundreds to one now if they should rebel those numbers could be used against the seraphim in the past their domed citadels advanced weaponry and synthetic drugs had rendered the seraphim unbeatable without their main method of control the daemons finally had a chance at freedom the slaves were kept in foul conditions and terminated at the first sign of illness or injury daemons were deemed an easily replaceable commodity and their life had no value to the seraphim and very little to themselves death was the one sure escape from their horrendous existence the soldiers fared no better being unimportant they were used as canon fodder and frontline troops in any and all wars such as the one with us the seraphim did not care how many soldiers they lost as they bred quickly and were not valued as living beings the only blood that mattered to the seraphim was that of their own race enraged that their lowly slaves had dared to rebel and incensed at the loss of seraphim life the seraphim decided their whole current race of slaves was expendable now they had less dangerous human slaves to replace them they committed genocide the seraphim are highly evolved and intelligent and they have been experimenting on their slaves for a very long time they already had a control solution in place all the female daemons lived in pits owned by seraphim the slavers released toxins into the pits murdering all the females without a means to reproduce the daemons were practically extinct in retaliation huge vats of the chemical compound deadly to seraphim were produced and released into the domed citadels atmospheres the effect was instantaneous there were no survivors there were seraphim off world though and being hermaphrodites they can all reproduce so the seraphim race was not exterminated they planned their revenge against the race which had allowed the daemons to revolt humans were to be destroyed utterly using a two pronged attack a virus was released into our atmosphere and water which accelerates the aging process it was intended to affect all humans but it wasnt quite perfect only women are affected but every woman is infected including me you will have noticed me aging as this journal progresses well over half our female population is already dead and the rest will soon follow we are as extinct as the daemons even girl babies in their mothers wombs are infected their cells growing old and dying before their little bodies can even form most are stillborn but the few that survive age in their cots and will not live long enough to reproduce in retaliation the daemons and humans joined forces using the chemical i developed as an antidote for the daemons they hunted down and destroyed every known seraph to my knowledge the race is extinct and to my shame i made this genocide possible the alliance has not relaxed its vigilance though they search diligently for seraphs to kill that concludes this journal i hope it adequately explained the cause of extinction of the daemon human and seraphim races may god have mercy on me for my part
7302739 the global economy is in a tough spot caught between sharply slowing demand in many advanced economies and rising inflation everywhere
7302740 its the rest of the world going down not the united states going up
7302741 exports have been sort of holding us out of the graveyard
7302742 that may begin to peter out a little bit if the dollar continues to climb
7302743 if the rest of the world economy slows the demand just isnt going to be there
7302744 the slowdown has reached such a wide range of countries that theyre now feeding on one another
7302745 leap and the net will americas toughest jobs premieres monday august 25
7302746 ich wusste dass meine teamkollegen etwas schneller als ich sein w rden aber ich war trotzdem in der lage zu gewinnen die meisterschaft ist nach wie vor greifbar und wir werden sehen was in donington so passiert ich hoffe dass ich dort auch gewinnen kann
7302747 ich kann mich ber den zweiten platz heute nicht beklagen
7302748 obwohl ich ein paar gesundheitliche probleme hatte war es insgesamt ein positives wochenende f r uns berholen war auf dieser strecke nicht einfach doch unsere rundenzeiten zeigten dass wir einen guten speed hatten und das stimmt mich zuversichtlich ich konnte meine f hrung in der gesamtwertung ausbauen und zusammen mit heikki holten wir 13 punkte das ist gut f r das team es war also ein zufriedenstellendes wenn auch nicht spektakul res wochenende f r uns
7302749 ich startete gut und berholte kimi r ikk nen vor der ersten kurve
7302750 mit dem weiteren rennen bis zum zweiten boxenstopp war ich nicht so zufrieden denn mit den h rteren reifen prime hatte ich zu wenig grip als wir dann auf die weicheren reifen option wechselten lief es besser und ich verk rzte etwas den abstand hinter robert kubica immerhin holte ich f nf z hler und ich freue mich dass das team gut gepunktet hat
7302751 wieder eine sehr solide leistung unseres mclaren mercedes teams die mit 13 wm punkten belohnt wurde
7302752 unsere siegchance verloren wir bereits im gestrigen qualifying ich bin sicher dass lewis das rennen wahrscheinlich von der spitze kontrolliert h tte wenn er mit der gleichen benzinmenge ins qualifying gegangen w re wie felipe massa
7302753 da das berholen auf dieser strecke sehr schwierig ist entschieden wir uns fr hzeitig dazu im hinblick auf die meisterschaft den zweiten platz zu sichern heikki fuhr nach seinem sieg in ungarn ebenfalls ein starkes rennen hielt dem druck von kimi r ikk nen stand und trug zu unserem punktekonto in der konstrukteurs wm bei
7302754 lewis f hrt in der fahrerweltmeisterschaft mit sechs punkten vor felipe massa und mit 13 punkten vor kimi r ikk nen kein team holte heute mehr punkte als wir in der konstrukteurs wm holten wir auf und in der fahrer wm bauten wir unsere f hrung leicht aus gl ckwunsch an felipe massa und ferrari zu einem starken rennen und dem sieg
7302755 der erste grand prix hier in valencia war eine gro artige premiere danke an die organisatoren und an bernie ecclestone dieser grand prix hat sicherlich zeichen gesetzt sehr positiv war au erdem dass unsere ersatzteilkisten das ganze wochenende ber geschlossen blieben wir mussten hier wo jeder mit vielen unf llen rechnete nicht ein einziges teil austauschen
7302756 wir werden jetzt weiter hart arbeiten um f r das letzte saisondrittel gut ger stet zu sein es beginnt in zwei wochen mit den rennen in spa und monza die innerhalb von acht tagen stattfinden und an die motoren die h chsten anforderungen der saison stellen
7302757 in the grand scheme of things this is a new low
7302758 this pub is a very respectable place that is used by many local groups the elderly and for social occasions for someone to come in and spray a load of bullets is definitely a new low with the risk of hurting innocent people
7302759 we have received great co operation so far and we are appealing for anyone with information to contact us
7302760 unfortunately shootings in dublin have become an all too regular occurrence
7302761 the fact that many shootings are taking place in public places such as last nights shootings in a pub in finglas shows that the criminals responsible have absolutely no fear of being caught
7302762 this is partially because of a lack of garda in the communities where they operate
7302763 sinn f in has been calling for higher garda visibility in communities that are suffering from high levels of crime we want to see extra garda patrols particularly on foot and on bicycle in these communities
7302764 when you do shop at the grocery store its very limited they dont have a very wide selection
7302765 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7302766 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7302767 it helps the local farmer it helps the families both stretch their food dollars and makes sure they are getting access to fruits and vegetables
7302768 es gibt offensichtlich eine unsch rfe in den vereinbarungen die die franzosen mit den russen geschlossen haben
7302769 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7302770 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7302771 si el tsj no nos restituye llegaremos hasta la oea
7302772 es un pronunciamiento hist rico qued demostrado la arbitrariedad y la poca autonom a del tsj para decidir fuimos destituidos por razones pol ticas la sentencia es un triunfo para la democracia y el estado de derecho
7302773 la decisi n est en manos de la presidenta luisa estella morales y de los dem s magistrados el tsj seguir inhabilitado mientras incumpla el mandato de la corte interamericana de derechos humanos no podemos hablar de poder judicial aut nomo mientras los jueces son perseguidos

7302775 ebay operates on one technology platform and to the extent that ebay has to change its business model in other countries it would change it everywhere
7302776 los organismos internacionales ya est n mirando con atenci n las violaciones de los derechos humanos que se han venido cometiendo en los ltimos diez a os en venezuela
7302777 estamos viviendo un clima de inestabilidad pol tica y por eso hemos echado a andar esta colecta de firmas nosotros somos dem cratas y nuestras armas son el coraz n la constituci n y las leyes el imperio que nos mueve es el imperio de la ley

7302779 en defensa de nuestra libertad y democracia tu firma estar en reserva en la oea
7302780 nosotros el 2 de diciembre le dijimos no al socialismo no a la fuerza armada bolivariana no a la violaci n del derecho a la propiedad y no al centralismo por eso la colecta de estas firmas es un acto que va paralelo a la elecci n de los nuevos l deres que van a conquistar alcald as y gobernaciones el 23 de noviembre el paquetazo de las 26 leyes lo interpretamos como otro trapo rojo que intenta desmotivar a los electores
7302781 esa es la oligarqu a que est chillando son 26 leyes para favorecer al pueblo eso ah est y no se las quitar nadie y promulgaremos 50 leyes m s si es necesario
7302782 los empresarios deben colocar su producci n y sus empresas al servicio de los intereses del pa s
7302783 andan de nuevo en esa que hay que matarme no me voy a esconder hoy haremos el al presidente desde la bombilla en petare y el lunes voy a tegucigalpa dios sabr nosotros nos cuidaremos
7302784 queremos hacer la negociaci n dentro del marco de la cordialidad pero tambi n lo haremos en cualquier terreno que sea necesario
7302785 lo que se est planteado es la disposici n de llegar a un acuerdo tanto del gobierno venezolano como de la empresa cemex
7302786 traza un camino para encontrar una soluci n favorable para ambas partes
7302787 nosotros como gobierno respetamos las decisiones soberanas de venezuela nosotros como gobierno de m xico tenemos la obligaci n de velar por los intereses de m xico y buscar lo que consideramos un trato justo y no discriminatorio
7302788 der sechs punkte plan ist nach jetzigem stand nicht erf llt

7302794 obviously its a blow the front row has been a bit of a cursed position for us this year
7302795 maurie is unlikely but well give him every chance and nick will come into contention
7302796 today is another important victory in the fight to preserve equal access to opportunity as was the case in oklahoma and missouri ward connerlys misguided and divisive effort has again fallen short this time in arizona in light of the staggering disqualification rate that the secretary of state found in its review of the signatures the curtain has been pulled back on connerlys attempts to abuse the democratic process

7302800 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7302801 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7302802 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7302803 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7302804 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7302805 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7302806 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7302807 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat

7302863 icant believe you turned me away at 9 55 blah blah blah blah blah
7302864 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7302865 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective has demonstrated is a winning combination
7302866 like care for working families and the poor and foreign policy premised on peace over war
7302867 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7302868 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7302869 separate themselves from communion with the church and should not present themselves for the eucharist
7302870 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7302871 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7302872 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7302873 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7302874 i know that joe will campaign well for and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7302875 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a
7302876 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes obamas made a very wise selection
7302877 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7302878 experience and relationships to help him obama govern both domestically and around the world
7302879 about george bush and four more years of the same
7302880 knowingly and intentionally rent lease profit from or make available for use with or without compensation a place for the purpose of unlawfully manufacturing storing distributing or using a controlled substance
7302881 the purpose of my legislation is not to prosecute legitimate law abiding managers of stadiums arenas performing arts centers licensed beverage facilities and other venues because of incidental drug use at their events
7302882 my bill would help in the prosecution of rogue promoters who not only know that there is drug use at their event but also hold the event for the purpose of illegal drug use or distribution
7302883 business owners have come to congress and told us there are only so many steps they can take to prevent any of the thousands of people who may attend a concert or a rave from using drugs and they are worried about being held personally accountable for the illegal acts of others
7302884 those concerns may well be overstated but they deserve a fuller hearing i think we would have been well served by making a greater effort to find out
7302885 ma tu si tu che mi hai abbandonata la sera ma tu di che razza sei umana o disumana umana se lasci la tua amica con amici che sai che possono stare svegli fino a tardi o in un canile disumana se la abbandoni

7302890 certo ma il tono pu ingannare le bugie non sono soltanto parole false possono essere anche una voce impostata per sembrare una cosa e invece unaltra una scatola vuota la societ dellapparire
7302891 some coffeehouse in dinkytown in 77 or 78 anybody remember that one
7302892 you may not use the services and may not accept the terms if a you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with google
7302893 its nice to come somewhere knowing that i had to play well and then actually do it
7302894 we try to get ourselves to play as well as we can every week
7302895 i have two weeks to impress nick and show him im playing okay the first week is out of the way and i seemed to have done that
7302896 i got caught in between clubs on the second and got too aggressive there
7302897 i knew i was swinging well and hit some really nice shots after that and knocked a few putts in
7302898 to be honest no one epitomised the spirit of the fringe this year so were just going to give it to you all
7302899 often misrepresented as a cow town stuck in the middle of flyover country
7302900 what i tell people is that had we known then what we know now we wouldve never bid for the convention
7302901 while this individual does not pose any immediate risk to the public we would still advise people not to approach him
7302902 we must be positive there must be no negativity to score that first goal is so important
7302903 so another 2 0 win against nordsjaelland would do me just fine but well go out there and give it everything weve got
7302904 of course theyll be favourites but well have about 900 fans cheering us on so we wont lack for support to me its only half time and our dream is still alive
7302905 i must admit i was disappointed in the first leg as i felt we deserved something from the game the goals we lost were bad ones so we must ensure were better organised in defence this time
7302906 i netted in three minutes at dunfermline on wednesday night and id like to grab another early counter in the uefa cup
7302907 that would give as that wee lift we need an early goal is what we need and id love to be the player who scores it
7302908 i still think we could pull it off in denmark but what we cant afford to do is concede an early goal
7302909 recovered from his plagiarism scandal by burying all presidential ambitions for a generation and burrowing into his senate work he wasnt a foreign policy expert so he became one
7302910 bringing out the hardcover last year during the hectic lead in to the primaries didnt help the book because it was perceived by some to be a campaign tool its actually a fine and moving memoir
7302911 wed been holding off releasing the paperback until the election season was over when we felt people would be able to focus on the human story he is telling but clearly this is a new opportunity for the book and its a great way to get to know who this man is and what he stands for
7302912 my goal is to make d c the highest performing urban school system in the country
7302913 the beijing games look set to become the biggest broadcasted event in olympic history
7302914 in china alone more than 102 million people watched the games live on line
7302915 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7302916 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7302917 its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
7302918 its a total diss to senator clinton in my opinion
7302919 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7302920 the simple message to the women who voted for hillary clinton is if you liked the last eight years under george w bush youre going to love the next four under john mccain
7302921 lets be honest its the most disastrous presidency weve had in modern american history and john mccain has said there are not a lot of significant issues that he disagrees with george w bush on
7302922 i suspect hillary clinton will be the good soldier and praise obama and rally her supporters to obama but the fact that he doesnt speak until the fourth night of the convention and that her supporters have significant roles on the first three nights could be risky
7302923 clinton and her supporters will be whooping it up on the convention floor for the first three nights while the obama backers look askance at them out of the corner of their eye waiting for him to take to the stage on the fourth and final night
7302924 race has always been a crucial issue in american politics and its one of the elephants in the room but there are a number of elephants in the room that obama has to deal with
7302925 hes still relatively new on the political scene and hes still introducing himself to the american people while theres an ongoing war so people wonder about his foreign policy and military affairs credentials and thats what selecting senator joe biden as his running mate was all about
7302926 there are a significant number of whites who wonder how can a black candidate not be terribly mad about the treatment of blacks in america over the course of history and what that anger could mean in terms of his governance
7302927 so that my head office bosses will not ask me questions about it
7302928 it is tough enough being in china and trying to counter sneaky companies like baidu but to sit overseas and direct anti piracy operations whilst not understanding the language culture social norms and even technology in china makes it a futile exercise
7302929 this is a rising up over a 5 000 year old institution that is being hammered right now
7302930 if proposition 8 fails there is an inevitable loss of religious freedom
7302931 i will defend to my last breath the right of any of those folks to exercise their religion as they believe they are called to do it
7302932 but ill resist to my last breath vote e mail and blog their right to inflict their religious beliefs on the constitution of the state of california
7302933 i absolutely think that jesus would support the freedom to marry and because of that as a follower of jesus it is absolutely incumbent upon me to support the freedom to marry as well
7302934 my faith supports the freedom to marry because as a jew i have a responsibility to fight for what is right and to help bring goodness into the world
7302935 its an interesting time to get to know each other in different ways

7302971 we have been receiving reports for quite some time that kato is more of a ji than an milf leader
7302972 with this i mean the communist new peoples army npa and even extreme rightist groups
7302973 now there is a big debate in the milf leadership on the peace process
7302974 they milf leaders are really really trying hard to strike a balance between showing sincerity and showing that they are a force to reckon with
7302975 self exiled communist leader jose maria joma sison has given orders for guerrilla fronts to undertake attacks knowing that government troops are busy in mindanao
7302976 then he and his men must stand down as government forces enforce the law
7302977 neutralized and punished in accordance with our law for their acts of terrorism against innocent and helpless civilians
7302978 the inaction of the milf leadership will be construed as tacit approval of the criminal acts of its three commanders and will be a clear proof of milf leaders insincerity to pursue the conclusion of the peace talks
7302979 there is no all out war in mindanao this military operations is waging all out peace in mindanao
7302980 malaca ang needs to provide direction not confusion the uncertainty will only end if somebody truly takes charge to put it simply that really should be the job of the president
7302981 we certainly dont want to happen to mindanao what happened to kosovo
7302982 i hope malaca ang will find the moral courage to send a diplomatic note to malaysia saying in no uncertain terms that the philippine government will implement its laws against criminals who attack and murder unarmed civilians
7302983 i am sure that the malaysian government will understand and will not give the impression that it condones the unlawful acts of the milf especially the unprovoked killing of innocent civilians

7303013 in the uk the government only vaccinates those deemed to be at high risk but evidence shows that this policy is failing a recent investigation into nhs use of the vaccine found only half of gp practices are following clinical guidelines on protecting patients this is leaving millions of patients at risk of a preventable disease the government itself has revealed that prisoners who are particularly at risk are left exposed to infection

7303040 es ist gut einen punkt nach hause zu bringen da es doch eine lange zeit her ist seit es das letzte mal passiert ist das rennen ist gut f r mich gelaufen und ich habe alles gegeben und bin immer wieder runden gefahren die sich wie qualifying runden angesp rt haben
7303041 es war da ein gro er kampf vor mir und ich konnte es nicht verhindern ihn zu treffen
7303042 meine pace war in ordnung aber ich war hinter barrichello und es war schwer ihn zu berholen schlie lich kam ich an ihm vorbei und habe mich verbessert aber es war zu sp t
7303043 ich hatte wirklich ein echt miserables wochenende ich hatte die grippe als ich ankam also hatte ich eigentlich jeden tag ziemliches fieber und wenig energie ich hatte auch probleme mit halsmuskelkr mpfen die beinahe dazu f hrten dass ich an diesem wochenende nicht fuhr
7303044 zum gl ck habe ich einen tollen trainer der geholfen hat pedro de la rosa hat sich schon aufs fahren gefreut
7303045 ich denke wenn man das bedenkt habe ich aber einen guten job gemacht
7303046 mit den option reifen im letzten stint hatte ich dann viel mehr grip und traktion dadurch konnte ich dann auch die l cke zu robert ein wenig schlie en zumindest habe ich f nf punkte geholt aber ein podestplatz w re viel netter gewesen

7303055 largando da posi o onde est vamos n o tinha muita chance
7303056 dava para ter sido melhor minha primeira volta n o foi boa de novo porque tive azar do alonso quebrar a asa na minha frente e ainda encostei com o coulthard
7303057 se n o fosse isso poderia ter ficado frente do rosberg em oitavo
7303058 eu quero estar acho que vou estar e tenho capacidade de estar com a equipe no ano que vem eles gostam de mim eu gosto da equipe ent o esse o plano
7303059 a prova foi muito tensa dif cil mas depois de um fim horr vel l gico que pensava durante a corrida se alguma poderia acontecer tinha um lado do diabinho que ficava espetando dizendo o motor pode quebrar e do outro lado o anjinho falando n o pode acontecer duas vezes seguidas havia os dois lados em que pensava principalmente nas ltimas dez voltas
7303060 mas acho que o trabalho hoje foi impec vel sensacional e mais uma vez mostrou uma for a em nosso carro ritmo vamos tentar mant la at o fim do campeonato que n o ser f cil mas vamos trabalhar muito para isso
7303061 sabia que o motor dele estava na segunda corrida o meu estava na primeira l gico que ficamos um pouco preocupados mas acho que consegui salvar bastante o motor nas ltimas 20 voltas agora veremos para pr xima corrida e tentaremos fazer o melhor para que nada aconte a
7303062 fiquei surpreso vimos esse tipo de manobra muitas vezes na f 1 neste ano em todos os anos ela foi totalmente aceit vel
7303063 acho que n o sou eu que tenho que responder meu trabalho fazer o melhor dentro da pista melhor para a equipe como sempre fiz se tiver que acontecer n o serei eu que decidirei apenas ficarei sabendo
7303064 a primeira volta foi dura pois eu estava no pelot o intermedi rio e perdi diversas posi es ap s isso tentei lutar mas o bico do meu carro estava danificado e foi dif cil ultrapassar uma pena que n o consegui chegar no
7303065 eu tinha uma reserva guardada para um ataque quando eles tivessem os pneus mais desgastados mas n o precisei usar pois eles acabaram batendo entre si e aproveitei para tomar a ponta
7303066 o carro estava muito bom felizmente n o tive os problemas mec nicos que me atrapalharam na sexta feira e no s bado
7303067 h ainda 40 pontos em jogo nas ltimas quatro corridas do ano ent o enquanto houver chances matem ticas preciso acreditar e tentar por m n o entrei na gp2 pensando no t tulo a meta era apenas manter os reflexos em dia
7303068 n o sei direito o que ocorreu passei por cima de muita sujeira pode ter sido tamb m um furo de pneu mas n o descarto a possibilidade de um erro s sei que estou bastante chateado com tudo
7303069 h muita coisa em jogo faltam quatro etapas e apenas uma delas pode mudar tudo o que preciso aproveitar as oportunidades

7303072 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7303073 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself

7303080 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7303081 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7303082 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7303083 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7303084 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7303085 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7303086 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7303087 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7303088 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7303089 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7303090 about what it means to be a good or bad catholic as a politician
7303091 i am on the dirt frontage road to the internet thingy
7303092 it could be due to the cost of living going up particularly food and petrol prices but there are signs that this is easing
7303093 the outlook is quite good with the reserve bank dropping the official cash rate and signalling cuts will continue people will be factoring that in as they anticipate cheaper mortgages and tax cuts which come in later this year
7303094 im not sure why southland is feeling pessimistic its one of those things that you cant pinpoint

7303104 promoting mental health for all americans will require scientific know how but even more importantly a societal resolve that we will make the needed investment the investment does not call for massive budgets rather it calls for the willingness of each of us to educate ourselves and others about mental health and mental illness and thus to confront the attitudes fear and misunderstanding that remain as barriers before us
7303105 culture and society play pivotal roles in mental health mental illness and mental health services clinicians view symptoms diagnoses and treatments in ways that sometimes diverge from their clients views especially when the cultural backgrounds of the consumer and provider are dissimilar
7303106 the mental health delivery system is fragmented and in disarray lead ing to unnecessary and costly disability homelessness school failure and incarceration the time has long passed for yet another piecemeal approach to mental health reform instead the commission recommends a fundamental transformation of the nations approach to mental health care
7303107 every year up to 30 of the population worldwide will suffer from some form of mental disorder and at least two thirds of those receive inadequate or no treatment even in countries with the best resources
7303108 barriers to effective treatment of mental illness include lack of recognition of the seriousness of mental illness and lack of understanding about the benefits of services policy makers insurance companies health and labour policies and the public at large all discriminate between physical and mental problems
7303109 stigma erodes confidence that mental disorders are real treatable health conditions we have allowed stigma and a now unwarranted sense of hopelessness to erect attitudinal structural and financial barriers to effective treatment and recovery it is time to take these barriers down mental illnesses are not the result of personal weakness lack of character or poor upbringing
7303110 all of us live with these daily threats to our mental health many of us also face additional challenges that test us and put our mental health at risk the good news is we have the knowledge and experience now about what works for good mental health
7303111 the mission of nimh is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research paving the way for prevention recovery and cure for the institute to continue fulfilling this vital public health mission it must foster innovative thinking and ensure that a full array of novel scientific perspectives are used to further discovery in the evolving science of brain behavior and experience
7303112 jon fleischmans flashreport is a great source to keep in touch with the political buzz stories ideas and opinions among californias conservative insiders
7303113 ive come to depend on jons great daily compendium and analysis of the news the flashreport is great and i recommend it to all who follow california politics

7303230 id be remiss if i didnt tell you that youd be out at the edge if you adopt this
7303231 i will tell you that ive been made to understand that you can go a couple of miles down the street and purchase cd roms depicting each of these things that would be prohibited by the ordinance except perhaps sexual conduct with minors which is a violation of federal law
7303232 of all the loony ordinances weve seen lately this one takes the cake
7303233 the county is attempting to create a new category of unprotected speech as a method of driving our client out of business
7303234 apparently nassau county believes that they are the first ones who thought about outlawing commercial pornography as a means of eliminating adult businesses
7303235 unfortunately for the county the first amendment poses a significant hurdle for their efforts
7303236 it seems to me like were being asked to legislate morality in nassau county
7303237 im not against it but i want to be very clear that thats what were going to do
7303238 described or depicted sexual conduct that the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest
7303239 that the work taken as a whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value
7303240 this modified miller test that theyve invented appears to be blatantly unconstitutional under a long line of supreme court cases most recently fsc v ashcroft which struck down another modified miller test dealing with virtual child pornography
7303241 well you know what people have got to move with the times they all want to hang on to custom and tradition custom and tradition is diametrically opposed to progress and reform they get the rules they know what they are before they go in there and because things go back to the other way you cant hold on to the old you gotta take on the new i think the best way to sum it up where many people can understand is chapter 16 of revelations he says behold i make all things new of former things are passed away you gotta be able to adapt and thats what our thing is adapt is improvise and overcome
7303242 a few of the boxes you know i have never ever pursued an olympic boxer
7303243 but this little guy i seen him beat our guy he was unbelievable hes got all the moves i see a china man doing this kind of stuff laughs you know what i mean and so its a remarkable thing and all of the fighters that are in there fighting you could never deal with excuses only results and it doesnt matter what rules you play by you got to go out and win you got to win man and then you can come back and talk about how difficult it was for you under the most strenuous conditions of what they were that is one of the mottos that i subscribe to many years ago im in it to win it i cant give in i cant give up and i cant quit so what i do is deal with results and not excuses in the foot race of life youre going against all type of odds when you get to the victory circle then you can demonstrate why you there and how much more difficult it was for you than your counterpart or your opposition but they dont interview losers so you gotta win
7303244 but when you got a guy thats gonna compete and hes there and hes really in that win category you know what i mean cotto had hell on his hands they both fought very valiantly but you could see margarito dominated that fight it was a good fight that demonstrated what cotto was made of to go out there and fight but more or less cotto quit on that fight he took two knees and went back to his corner and told them that it was over so thats the only thing that hurt me because puerto ricans dont quit but he did

7303258 slates describes the combined use of effective enterprise search and discovery using links to connect information together into a meaningful information ecosystem using the model of the web providing low barrier social tools for public authorship of enterprise content tags to let users create emergent organizational structure extensions to spontaneously provide intelligent content suggestions similar to amazons recommendation system and signals to let users know when enterprise information they care about has been published or updated such as when a corporate rss feed of interest changes while slates forms the basic framework of enterprise 2 0 it does not negate all of the higher level web 2 0 design patterns and business models

7303272 i cant complain with second place today this was a strong weekend for us despite my having a few problems health wise but we pulled through the track was pretty difficult to overtake on but i maintained the gap our lap times showed that our overall pace was good which was encouraging heikki and i scored 13 points today which is very positive for the team so id describe it as a satisfactory weekend for us
7303273 my start was good and i was consequently able to overtake kimi before the first corner however im not really happy with how the race went for me after that because i had grip problems with the prime tyres in the first and second stints whereas with the option tyres in the last stint i had much better grip and traction as a result i could close the gap to a little at least i scored five points but a podium would have been much nicer having said that its good that the team scored a lot of points with lewiss second place and my fourth place
7303274 we saw another extremely solid vodafone team performance today the result of which was a very useful clutch of championship points but in truth we lost the chance of outright victory yesterday in qualifying in my view its pretty clear that if lewis had qualified with the same level of fuel as felipe hed probably have been able to control the race from the front but the nature of the circuit dictated that it was always going to be difficult for him to overtake today and that being the case we opted fairly early on to take the championship strategic option of settling for second place following on from his victory in hungary heikki also drove very strongly and helped bolster our points total in the constructors championship he responded well to the pressure applied by kimi and thoroughly deserved his fourth place
7303275 i want you to go to the window open it stick your head out and yell im as mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore
7303276 its a blow the front row has been a bit of a cursed position for us this year

7303292 i disagree categorically with mr gonzales the constitution guarantees the right of habeas corpus unless in the case of rebellion or invasion it is suspended my national security with justice act reinforces this constitutional right by extending by statute meaningful habeas review for all guant namo detainees

7303301 i have been using your adrenoboost for a few months now and although i was skeptical that it would help i was desperate i have worked in a highly pressurized corporate environment for more than a decade and being a woman always felt the extra pressure to prove myself as well after a few weeks of using adrenoboost and trying to eat more healthily i started to notice a difference and for the first time in years i woke up feeling refreshed in the morning i had forgotten what that felt like thank you for an amazing product it has helped me to regain control
7303302 i started researching natural products and came across your site and ordered the adrenoboost boy am i glad i did i havent had such energy and stamina since my 20s
7303303 i am going to stock up on your adrenoboost remedy i dont quite know how i survived without it
7303304 i found your product on the internet and showed the information to my doctor he was cynical but said i could try it as long as it was under his monitoring after a few months on adrenoboost i felt better than i had in a long time my doctor was impressed and so am i thank you so much for providing a safe and effective alternative i am going to tell everyone i know about your natural remedies
7303305 now that i am 73 i decided to find help on my own and met up with your web site i have been taking adrenoboost now for 4 weeks and have noticed a definite change i had to start with a very low dosage now i am up to the normal dosage and am sure that it is definitely helping me i will probably take adrenoboost the rest of my life thank god for natural remedies and your website

7303318 the president remains committed to peace but the development in mindanao leaves us no choice but to review and revisit the provision contained in the moa ad the administration of pgma upholds greater public interest she is committed to upholding the constitution and thus will seek peace within the boundaries of law set within the constitution

7303324 i think im fitting in better today and i think that next week ill feel the same way
7303325 i think the guys in that room would say theyre getting a better feel for me and how i play i felt more at ease in the huddle i felt more at ease on the field
7303326 but it looks like hes getting more and more comfortable each and every day and every game
7303327 ill present my side ill say that id love to play one series two series
7303328 he may say that its not worth it and so be it
7303329 that was probably just me staying in mike mccarthys ear
7303330 i say heck if im going to practice i want to play at least a series

7303333 i would prefer not to be hit but thats ok
7303334 to sit here and say as the season gets under way that i wont get hit thats crazy i think our line is very good but most of the teams well be playing against are good
7303335 but i was able to use my feet to bail myself out a little bit
7303336 he was on the corners all night the ball was down he mixed his pitches
7303337 we knew coming into the game we saw that they lost
7303338 he hides the arm a little bit his changeup looks just like his fastball it can be up in the zone which can look like a fastball and get early swings on it
7303339 i think after the first time around we just kind of dialed in on him
7303340 i was feeling good enough to throw another inning and tc comes in with the bases loaded gets an rbi
7303341 i cant control that i went six innings anything to help the team win
7303342 the radar gun only says 86 or 88 but hes a lot more sneaky than that
7303343 he kind of turns his body a little bit hes got a little bit of a pause then all of a sudden out comes the ball
7303344 im just looking for a good pitch and trying to use the whole field
7303345 they got a couple of runs that inning and we could have been out of there and still seen a 2 1 ballgame
7303346 but then it just kind of got out of hand

7303370 they are a living thing and like humans there are some good ones and there are some bad ones some people say their dog would never be aggressive but i think that could be brought out in most of them
7303371 humans like dogs are very social and you need to have certain rules of engagement otherwise there is complete chaos
7303372 people are interpreting morality in that sense when they look at dogs but they could well be very basic fundamental behaviours that animals exhibit

7303387 i got a good start and i pushed to the maximum right from the early laps in the second part of the race the car was exceptional but also in the final stint when i had the softer tyres i could do the lap times easily this is an important moment in my career and i must continue to work in this way i am sorry for what happened to kimi we have to look very carefully at our reliability i am confident the team knows which countermeasures to take to react to this issue as it has always done in the past
7303388 today i lost a place at the start and i was stuck in traffic for all of the first stint then when i had a clear track ahead of me i was able to push and was doing good lap times at the second pit stop i made a mistake and left before i should have done fortunately pietro timpini is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke now we must concentrate on preparing for the next rounds and on improving our qualifying performance
7303389 now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react
7303390 we still have two test sessions at monza and then jerez and a lot of hard days work in the factory finally i want to say a few words about piero timpini our mechanic unfortunately injured in kimis second pit stop his first words were to say sorry as though the incident was his fault it is thanks to the passion dedication and professionalism that these guys show on a daily basis for ferrari how special is our team

7303395 everyone knows that these are the games we have to win if we are going to mount a serious title challenge too many home points were squandered last season
7303396 maybe our fans were thinking of what happened last season when we drew too many games at home
7303397 but this time we have sent out a message that we can produce results like this
7303398 last season we had some bad home results but this time around we have tried very hard to be positive and to make sure such things do not happen again this win shows we can do it
7303399 ive had problems with my groin throughout pre season and things have not gone the way i wanted them to
7303400 i have missed a lot of training and i am a couple of weeks behind the other lads when it comes to match fitness
7303401 the only way i am going to get that edge again is to get out on the pitch and play
7303402 i am not at my best at the moment but i hope the fans will be patient because i am only three weeks away from my best form and fitness
7303403 i have been given a fantastic opportunity to play for the team i supported as a kid and all i want to do is work hard and fight for my place in the team
7303404 you could tell how much our winner meant to the fans the roof came off when my goal went in

7303413 gerrard has quality he can score the sort of goal he got he has that ability right at the death he has done it before and he will continue to have the mentality to win games at the end
7303414 we sent a lot of players forward the idea was to have many people around their box it does leave us open to a counter attack but it is a gamble we will take
7303415 we know we did not play well but you have to win games like this if you want to be contenders for the title it is a message for everyone for the rest of the season
7303416 last season we would probably have lost or drawn but now we have different qualities and we have many options
7303417 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a qualifier
7303418 i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages
7303419 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg their manager said we were sleeping but they deserve credit for the way they played they were spot on tactically hitting us on the counter attack we didnt play well and we know well have to improve tactically
7303420 any side which can keep fernando torres and robbie keane as quiet as they did in the first leg has quality we didnt have any chances in the game
7303421 it would be unthinkable for us not to be in the champions league to go through will give us momentum and confidence
7303422 im absolutely flattered that my name is being mentioned about managing the great britain team he told the sunday mirror yesterday would i take it if they offered it to me absolutely i would be a fool not to ive had some great managerial jobs during my career but there is no doubt this would be the icing on the cake the fact it is being held on my old stamping ground in east london makes it even more appealing
7303423 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that i think when people are looking at the olympics in 2012 britain home of football where football was invented which we gave to the world i think people would be very surprised if there is an olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it
7303424 painkiller is a 1990 gold certified album by british heavy metal band
7303425 the idea for the painkiller cover was inspired by the sad wings cover i approached the band with the idea that how would that angel in hell look like now in the future robotic riding a bike its all about floating ideas and it worked
7303426 i think the basic concept came out of conversations that we all had about taking the concept of an angel from the sad wings of destiny cover in a robo cop type of mode we put all this armor and stuff on it but it still had the wings but they were made of steel and everything and then we thought about the motorcycle that we always use and thought about making that into something unusual like a man machine kind of animal thing and then the dragon bike developed out of that and all of these things came together
7303427 its a typical fantasy priest character you dont know whether its from heaven or hell but you do know you wouldnt like to meet him on a dark night or to upset him we did feel that maybe wed over used that type of image but it s sort of expected from us and it s just a bit of fun really
7303428 the band originally suggested a hells angel type character on a motorcycle but also with a metallic creature my recollection is that he would have been a pillion rider or maybe even made into part of the bike eventually i had the idea of flipping the idea on its head and having the metal creature sitting on the bike making the bike the living creature instead and the chainsaw idea came to me because my studio at the time was above a hardware shop

7303474 we are currently reviewing their technical and economic terms but not their political component
7303475 did someone within the u s suggest that iraq reach out to russia as a show of good will or did russia want to show that they are indispensable in the middle east that they are a player
7303476 russia wants to go back into areas where it has lost influence
7303477 they might be able to say we are a responsible player that would certainly counter their image over the past two weeks as a force that can do a lot of damage
7303478 the only danger is if there are deals to sell off some of that infrastructure to russia power plants and such
7303479 that would come with greater political influence which would not fit in with our policies in the middle east

7303495 anything you dont have to treat me like im radioactive im going to the prom with bridget its no big deal
7303496 the fuck do i care if youre dating some bitch
7303497 why not she is no matter how gorgeous she is
7303498 i dont know whats going on between you and her and i dont care youve changed dan youre never around you dont hang out
7303499 i understand why you prefer spending time with elaine instead of those losers
7303500 whatever elaine said i should ask how your mom reacted when you told her we were going to the prom together
7303501 what happened she went nuts over my dead body is an exact quote
7303502 my mommy got down on her hands and knees and begged me to change my mind shes afraid of what your mother might do to her
7303503 ill talk to her ill keep her away from julia
7303504 no dont bother elaine said that youve honestly tried to help my mommy
7303505 i appreciate that really but there might be another way to fix things between them
7303506 dont worry about it something that elaine suggested but that isnt our only problem
7303507 first she begged me not to go to the prom with you and then she begged me to bring you with her she loves your dick as much as i do
7303508 thats why i didnt tell her about my little plan until now i knew shed be a total pest pleading me to bring you to our house so she could fuck you
7303509 well if you want me to pay julia a visit i guess i could be persuaded to
7303510 i dont want you and you mom ganging up on her
7303511 if you want me to like you and respect you dont even think about my mommy in that way and let me tell you something right now i dont like you and im not even close to respecting you
7303512 i cant believe im actually saying that its like im in the middle of a bad porn movie
7303513 ok tomorrow were going to get your tuxedo and get your hair cut
7303514 we dont have enough time for me to go into the details well go to my stylist and shell make you look human and i know where to get a tux that doesnt look like something you should be buried in
7303515 no ill handle it myself no if you were here it would only make things more complicated
7303516 bill shes here ok ok i love you too i promise ill make it up to you bye bye
7303517 i understand that you and my son are going to the prom together
7303518 are you surprised because im so far out of his league or do you think im not good enough for him
7303519 no youre not good enough for my son you are beautiful thats true extraordinarily beautiful
7303520 youre welcome dear but i know that the only reason youre going out with danny is to get back at me because of what you think im doing to your mother maybe you plan on making danny fall in love with you and then break his heart
7303521 thats part of it but its not that simple hes in love with me
7303522 he should be with a girl he can have fun with a girl who treats him right
7303523 i do i like him a lot do you know why
7303524 no its not his dick thats why i dream about him every night when i play with myself but that isnt why i like him
7303525 because hes a snob just like me he says what he wants does what he wants and he doesnt give a shit what anyone thinks about him he stood up to michael panucci and didnt back off even when four of them started beating him and do you know what he told me
7303526 he said that he doesnt want to have sex with me he wants my respect he wants me to like him can you believe that
7303527 yes can you understand that makes me proud of him
7303528 sure thats what made me interested in him hes the only man who ever told me to my face that he wasnt interested in my body i mean i know hes interested but at least hes trying to resist me
7303529 hell probably be the last man able to do that dear
7303530 its very simple i want you to stop tormenting my mommy
7303531 if you to promise to leave her alone and never see her again i wont destroy danny
7303532 so once again we come back to julia dear dont you understand that the mere fact that youre here pleading with me shows that she needs a firm hand
7303533 your mother and i have a two way relationship its not that i impose myself on her she submits willingly when she gives herself to me she finds a different kind of fulfillment than she does with any other partner
7303534 if you break things off with my mommy it will save danny a lot of pain
7303535 what makes you think you can manipulate him so easily
7303536 you think i cant wrap him around my little finger please
7303537 no come now what kind of deal is this for me really i get nothing out of it i have break things off with your mother and thats a relationship that gives me a tremendous amount of pleasure and even if you let danny down gently hes going to be miserable you get everything you want and i get nothing
7303538 i dont think you understand danny with a case of the blues is nothing compared to what i could do to him
7303539 i understand you perfectly but hes a big boy he needs to learn that life isnt always fair and easy life can be cruel as well as kind
7303540 i dont doubt that for a second dear but i think youre underestimating danny hes more resourceful and resilient than you think he is and
7303541 youre too clever to think id cave in like that
7303542 i dont think you came here looking to make a deal
7303543 ill take my mothers place leave her alone and ill be your slave

7303565 women who want an abortion have always been able to get one
7303566 an indolent man devoted to music and the punt who operated with a lit cigarette at his lips singing snatches of gilbert and sullivan
7303567 those providing abortion had a vested interest in it remaining illegal
7303568 from a practical standpoint i dont think it will have a huge effect in fact the general attitude of people to the resurfacing of debate about abortion is oh abortion didnt they fix that years ago
7303569 what they actually did in a kind of very australian way was jury rig a solution that seemed to reflect a majority view while also reflecting a residual ambivalence
7303570 i was conscious then mostly of the unborn child but after 20 years experience having talked to many women whove had abortions decades ago the more significant issue is the effect on women
7303571 just as its cruel to pretend that stillbirth and adoption didnt change a woman the motherhood is as real for those whove had abortions
7303572 the offer of counselling to be compulsory and it should be independent counselling not counselling that pushes women towards abortion
7303573 i think there are a lot of women in the labor party who have personally had abortions and dont want to feel they are criminals
7303574 and i dont want to make them feel like criminals i want them to be able to acknowledge that abortion is not a clump of cells
7303575 the final taboo the thing we dont talk about and i think the damage comes from the guilt
7303576 i dont regret for one second what i did the damage is done by other people who want to make it a massive secret and make it a crime
7303577 my family werent aware my mother i could never have told her
7303578 we dont think there should be a cut off point
7303579 theres a tiny number of late term abortions 21 done in victoria last year and 300 done post 20 weeks these are very much wanted pregnancies that go hideously wrong the testing isnt done until 20 weeks so there cant be that cut off
7303580 safe legal abortion is essential parliament should not legislate on issues of private morality it is for women to make their personal decisions according to their conscience
7303581 doctors need no longer fear that they will unexpectedly be subject to investigations adverse press and possible criminal charges
7303582 we want the government to vote for model c so women have complete control
7303583 it is up to a woman whether she wants to have a baby or not
7303584 abortions that are late are only done in the most extreme circumstances but it really doesnt matter if it the fetus can survive or not
7303585 you have to start with the premise that its a womans right to decide if a woman doesnt have that right she will abort anyway
7303586 we believe abortion is a serious moral issue but we do not believe abortion should remain a matter for criminal law
7303587 reading the report leaves the clear impression that this could have been penned directly by the abortion industry itself it reads like a pro death wish list
7303588 has been a real impediment to debate and to best practice
7303589 its given a lot of air space to the anti choice brigade they are dealing with something that is illegal so they can get upset and angry about it
7303590 these changes will pave the way for some sensible debate once abortion is legal we will be able to say ok how can we improve it
7303591 we will be able to collect data who has abortions why do they have them
7303592 the service will improve its a grey area in the law so doctors arent attracted to it i can understand why a doctor would not want to get into it so we may not have best practice

7303597 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7303598 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
7303599 include that drilling let it compete and see where we come down on it and if that in fact is a good alternative then that is something that we should do

7303702 i think the states plan lacks a lot compared to our final plan
7303703 they didnt take into consideration competitive balance whereas they just looked at geography and numbers heck you could get a secretary to do that the competitive imbalances of some of those divisions are absurd
7303704 what i think is workable is the fact that the state has recognized and agreed there is a problem thats a big step forward
7303705 what puts ours head and shoulders above it is our attempt to work out competitive balance
7303706 i like ours a whole lot better i didnt hear that kind of complaining when ours came out

7303708 a full fair schedule historically weve tried to look at it from a football perspective first its the tail that wags the dog obviously the state did not look at it that way and it does fail when you talk about competitive balance that certainly could not have been a priority
7303709 i think our plan addressed the private school issue a lot better
7303710 no matter what plan you have there are always going to be people who are upset and people who are happy but i dont think they really addressed the main concerns
7303711 i thought the lopsided scores in some of their games were harmful to both the winner and loser now they dont even play st joes or bergen twice in the regular season
7303712 all they did was a political decision hoping this would go away we got away from the politics and tried to satisfy the majority of the needs and we didnt become sports specific the problem is in north jersey and the north needs to solve the problem and the njsiaa committee that was put together either had its hands tied or werent pro active enough they didnt succeed so the problem might have gotten worse

7303739 i realized that to make an r all i had to do was first write a p and then draw a line down from its loop and i was so surprised that i could turn a yellow letter into an orange letter just by adding a line
7303740 i often associate letters and numbers with colors every digit and every letter has a color associated with it in my head sometimes when letters are written boldly on a piece of paper they will briefly appear to be that color if im not focusing on it some examples s is red h is orange c is yellow j is yellow green g is green e is blue x is purple i is pale yellow 2 is tan 1 is white if i write shcjgex it registers as a rainbow when i read over it as does abcpdef
7303741 when people ask me about the sensation they might ask so when you look at a page of text its a rainbow of color it isnt exactly like that for me when i read words about five words around the exact one im reading are in color its also the only way i can spell i remember in elementary school remembering how to spell the word priority because the color scheme in general was darker than many other words i would know that an e was out of place in that word because es were yellow and didnt fit
7303742 when i actually look at words on a page the letters themselves are not colored but instead in my mind they all have a color that goes along with them and it has always been this way i remember back in kindergarten thinking that each homeroom had a different color associated with it i would sometimes say things referring to that class and calling it by its color it is also like this with days of the week months and so on i thought this was caused by me over thinking things but i finally have come to realise that synesthesia is real

7303810 undoubtedly it does good it promotes a strong sense of community opens its doors to all who wish to come but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic

7303859 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7303860 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7303861 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7303862 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7303863 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7303864 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7303865 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history

7303875 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7303876 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7303877 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7303878 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7303879 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7303880 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7303881 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7303882 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7303883 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7303884 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7303885 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7303886 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7303887 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7303888 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7303889 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7303890 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7303891 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7303892 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7303893 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted
7303894 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7303895 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7303896 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7303897 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7303898 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7303899 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7303900 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7303901 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7303902 i voted for the bill before i voted against it

7303913 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7303914 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7303915 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7303916 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7303917 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7303918 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7303919 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7303920 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7303921 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7303922 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7303923 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7303924 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7303925 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7303926 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7303927 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7303928 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7303929 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7303930 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7303931 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7303932 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7303933 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7303934 right now more than ever we just cant afford insert here

7303957 ellos fueron m s contundentes en los momentos importantes no supimos aumentar las ventajas que conseguimos por ah la expulsi n nos afect aunque suene a pretexto pero debemos ver para adelante
7303958 no vamos a poner pretextos ni peros ellos hicieron su trabajo y la metieron duele todo porqu es derrota debido a que la idea es jugar bien metimos goles pero tambi n recibimos muchos hubo desatenciones y ah est la derrota hay que analizar los errores
7303959 el equipo nunca se desesper a n perdiendo al arranque del segundo tiempo por lo que demostr que no existe esa palabra que tanto es blanco de muchas cr ticas como lo es la campeonitis
7303960 no s si el equipo ya est al nivel de cuando obtuvo el campeonato pero lo que me da m s gusto es la reaparici n de daniel emmanuel ludue a quien ten a para tres meses de rehabilitaci n pero que estuvo listo en dos y qu mejor que lo haga con un gol retomando de nueva cuenta el nivel
7303961 qu bueno que se pudo queremos ir paso a paso no podemos pensar todav a en otro campeonato ya que primero tenemos que calificar debemos estar tranquilos y estar conscientes que al parecer ya estamos completos
7303962 fue un partidazo de ida y vuelta chivas tuvo sus aproximaciones aunque nosotros tambi n y concretamos m s que ellos supimos aprovechar las ocasiones de gol en un ritmo importante de juego
7303963 todos mis compa eros hicieron un gran trabajo arriba mati y christian estuvieron muy bien y acertados es un resultado muy positivo para nosotros nunca me pas por la mente resentirme de la lesi n
7303964 ante chivas no hab a que desesperarnos sab amos que juegan muy bien ya que aprovechan los espacios que dejan y ah te atacan pero nosotros hacemos el futbol que nos caracteriza y ah est el resultado

7303980 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7303981 he also has an occasional tendency to stick his foot in his mouth

7303987 4 the images were taken with a kddi sh w52sh drag an image and right click to see properties go to flickr and there is no image in their kddi sh database
7303988 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7303989 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7303990 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7303991 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7303992 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7303993 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7303994 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7303995 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7303996 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems

7304013 the bill permits the board of game to allow a predator program for wolves and grizzly bears if the commissioner of fish and game finds an emergency where wolves or grizzly bears in an area are causing a decline in prey
7304014 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7304015 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7304016 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7304017 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7304018 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7304019 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7304020 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7304021 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7304022 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7304023 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7304024 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7304025 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7304026 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7304027 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7304028 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7304029 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7304030 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7304031 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7304032 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7304033 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7304034 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7304035 i was surprised and a little disappointed i thought that big businesses in the united states were by and large recognizing domestic partnerships like this for health care benefits
7304036 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7304037 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7304038 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7304039 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7304040 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7304041 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7304042 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7304043 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7304044 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7304045 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7304046 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7304047 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7304048 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7304049 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7304050 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7304051 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7304052 the beat him up and left him for dead in the bush
7304053 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7304054 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7304055 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7304056 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7304057 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7304058 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7304059 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7304060 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7304061 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7304062 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7304063 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7304064 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7304065 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7304066 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7304067 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7304068 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7304069 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7304070 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7304071 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7304072 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7304073 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7304074 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7304075 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7304076 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7304077 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7304078 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7304079 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7304080 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7304081 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7304082 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7304083 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7304084 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7304085 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7304086 im big and beautiful and doing my best to keep my stress levels down so i can stay healthy thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
7304087 what we want now is a comprehensive things to do from the icc so that we could implement those measures in the next home series against india
7304088 when suicide bombings happen in pakistan of course those who live thousands miles away from our country have fears
7304089 we even told these four countries to send their representatives and have their own security assessment
7304090 not only us but india had also decided to boycott
7304091 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7304092 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7304093 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7304094 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7304095 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7304096 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7304097 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7304098 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7304099 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7304100 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7304101 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7304102 the only common denominator between all those non commitment guys is me
7304103 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7304104 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7304105 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7304106 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7304107 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7304108 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7304109 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7304110 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7304111 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7304112 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7304113 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7304114 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7304115 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7304116 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7304117 oh weve got more important things we have to do

7304150 het wordt gezegd dat hier een schild is dat niemand kan dragen of onheil of de dood zal hem binnen drie dagen treffen of hij zal voor altijd verminkt worden maar sir
7304151 ik zal het morgen dragen om dit avontuur te beproeven
7304152 en als ik het avontuur van dit schild niet volbreng moet u het op zich nemen want ik weet zeker dat u niet zult falen
7304153 sir daar stem ik geheel en al mee in want ik heb geen schild
7304154 dit schild hoort om geen andere nek te hangen dan die van de waardigste ridder van de wereld daarom raad ik u ridders om goed na te denken
7304155 ik weet wel dat ik niet de beste ridder ben maar ik zal proberen het te dragen
7304156 wacht alstublieft hier tot u weet hoe het mij vergaat
7304157 ridder dat was een grote dwaasheid van u want dit schild behoort slechts te worden gedragen door hem die in deze wereld geen gelijke heeft
7304158 breng dit schild naar de goede ridder sir galahad die u in de abdij achterliet en groet hem hartelijk van mij
7304159 want het is niet aan u noch aan enige sterveling om die te weten
7304160 bij de genade van jezus christus zeg mij waarom dit schild door niemand kan worden gedragen zonder dat hem onheil treft
7304161 de ridder die bagdemagus heeft verwond laat u groeten en vraagt u om dit schild te dragen waardoor grote avonturen plaats zullen vinden
7304162 dat zult u niet doen want ik moet alleen gaan op deze schildknaap na die mij zal vergezellen
7304163 het was twee ndertig jaar na de passie van onze heer jezus christus dat jozef van arimathea die edele ridder die onze heer van het heilige kruis afnam uit jeruzalem vertrok met een groot deel van zijn verwanten

7304192 i remember when it poured and you sang to me in summer its a fantasy
7304193 we must be positive there must be no negativity to score that first goal is so important
7304194 so another 2 0 win against nordsjaelland would do me just fine but well go out there and give it everything weve got
7304195 of course theyll be favourites but well have about 900 fans cheering us on so we wont lack for support to me its only half time and our dream is still alive
7304196 i must admit i was disappointed in the first leg as i felt we deserved something from the game the goals we lost were bad ones so we must ensure were better organised in defence this time
7304197 i netted in three minutes at dunfermline on wednesday night and id like to grab another early counter in the uefa cup
7304198 that would give as that wee lift we need an early goal is what we need and id love to be the player who scores it
7304199 i still think we could pull it off in denmark but what we cant afford to do is concede an early goal
7304200 china has been quick to catch up with india and surpass it in terms of art prices despite paying attention to art post 2004 bulk of the buyers of chinese art are westerners who started looking to quality chinese art in galleries spread across hong kong the indian market on the other hand is homegrown
7304201 few people were interested in chinese artists and their art
7304202 the global nature of the collectors have changed most of them have made money on their own which has given an amount of self confidence they see good things about indian and chinese art on the front pages of newspapers and flock to the global sales
7304203 now you have celebrities collectors like charles saatchi and frank cohen buying indian art i am sure we will cross the chinese market in the next three to four years
7304204 they are more focused on quality and only the best are being picked up it has never happened in the art market before

7304245 we are competing for the tri nations its a seriously tough competition you only have to look at the games so far to see that
7304246 our mindset is to get up for the challenge next week if we can do that there might be an opportunity for us a couple of weeks after that
7304247 everyone can do the ramifications and what ifs but that wont come into play too much for us
7304248 chalk and cheese i feel very honoured to have been part of that era winning pretty much every trophy there was to win
7304249 at the moment we are a group that is starting on a journey that hopefully is very productive but its only a beginning for this group
7304250 if you ask that question in a year or two hopefully ill give you a positive answer
7304251 we have come over so many times and got so close but weve faced disappointment after disappointment
7304252 to finally get the monkey off our back is just great
7304253 that really emphasises where this group is at at the moment weve got so many young guys who havent got that baggage i think that helps all those guys whose first time it was on african soil i thought they did really well
7304254 belief was something that i mentioned before the game that always gets tested over here and again it came into play late in the game the positive mindset this team has and the belief is so far holding us in good stead
7304255 i lost my composure a little bit but that was because i was pretty dirty with myself for what i did a few minutes before which led to them scoring
7304256 it was a square up as far as i was concerned so i was pretty happy also in the context of the game it got us into a more comfortable position
7304257 we know this is a two match tour very happy with what we achieved today and rightly so but another challenge awaits us in seven days

7304267 silver star is our long term solution to the gang problems on the central coast we must have firm enforcement to keep our communities safe now but unless we pair that with serious prevention efforts we will never be tackling the root of the problem
7304268 like any education or health initiative we have to set children on the right path at an early age silver star aims to do just that through all of its programs and dedicated staff they do a great job and are worthy of praise
7304269 due to the difficult fiscal times we are facing this funding is vital to continue the services for our youth and families
7304270 we owe a debt of gratitude to congressman farr for his continuing support of these critical programs
7304271 silver star is exactly the kind of local project that federal dollars should support
7304272 i visited their facilities in january and spoke with the kids who are being helped by the programs and it was a very touching time i will continue to support silver star its one of the few bright lights in our battle against gang violence
7304273 keeping the central coasts military presence on the cutting edge has been a top priority of mine
7304274 from fort hunter liggett in the south to dli and nps in the north our active duty presence is vital to military readiness and im pleased to have funds included in this bill for important programs
7304275 this is another example of states being two steps ahead of the federal government with the white house and gop leadership continuing to block environmental bills states are being forced to come up with their own plans
7304276 instead of wasting time debating offshore drilling plans that are opposed by the public and which will do nothing to solve our energy problems the ocean action plan wisely promotes renewable offshore energy and ecosystem based management to ensure our ocean are being administered responsibly and protected for future generations

7304282 non ho mai detto che gli insegnanti del sud abbassano la qualit della scuola italiana chi riporta il mio pensiero in questo modo in grave malafede e vuole creare una polemica che chi conosce il mio pensiero sa che non ha fondamento

7304284 la principal diferencia entre este partido y el de la fase de grupos ha sido la intensidad

7304372 i stood in the field tonight and just had one goal in my mind that was to win the gold medal
7304373 i wanted to perform well throughout the game but at the end of the ninth inning i felt a little bit nervous
7304374 im very sorry that the umpire judged that it was a ball
7304375 i think its not funny to joke about whether it is a ball or a strike in this final so i appealed but i failed so i was ejected but when i heard our team won the gold medal i felt very happy i was not worried at all because i knew my ejection would lead to a more boosted morale on my team
7304376 tonight we faced a good pitcher he was really tough on the batters
7304377 and the last situation in the ninth inning we were not able to execute but thats baseball

7304501 any investment strategy that allocates significant portions of the portfolio to volatile or illiquid assets

7304503 these are products that have just disappeared and we certainly dont expect to be coming back
7304504 there is an overwhelming level of investor concern about what will happen in credit markets as opposed to what has happened that is impacting issuance
7304505 we have seen far more contagion of risk than anyone anticipated
7304506 we are not seeing much happening at the moment and yes it is the height of the vacation season in u s and europe but i think it is deliberate nothing is being done

7304509 if we reasonably assume that the treasury would only intervene in the event that fannie or freddie is declared significantly undercapitalized by its regulator
7304510 then interest payments on the qualifying subordinated debt is automatically deferred for up to five years
7304511 to the extent that theyre nationalized theyre not going to default on their debt or derivative obligations
7304512 i think most parties would look at it as the u s government stepping in and guaranteeing the obligations of fannie and freddie
7304513 to that extent a counterparty to a derivatives contract with fannie and freddie would take great comfort in that
7304514 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7304515 performed worst both as regards macroeconomic stability and as regards one of the two time dimensions of financial stability minimising the likelihood and severity of future financial crises
7304516 partly as the result of an accident of history did best as regards putting out fires
7304517 cognitive regulatory capture of the fed by wall street resulted in excess sensitivity of the fed not just to asset prices the greenspan bernanke put but also to the concerns and fears of wall street more generally
7304518 between the taf tslf the pdcf the rescue of bear stearns and the opening of the discount window to fannie mae and freddie mac the fed and the us tax payer have effectively underwritten directly all of the
7304519 these errors are shared by many federal open market committee members and by senior staff
7304520 although the bernanke fed has but a short track record its too often rather panicky and exaggerated reactions and actions since august 2007 suggest that it also may have a distorted and exaggerated view of the importance of the financial sector for macroeconomic stability
7304521 the fed listens to wall street and believes what it hears
7304522 this distortion into a partial and often highly distorted perception of reality is unhealthy and dangerous
7304523 as if by osmosis the objectives interests and perception of reality of the vested interest they are meant to regulate and supervise in the public interest

7304525 there are a lot of unguided missiles that have been shot off
7304526 financial institutions can hold low quality securities for the period where no reporting is required
7304527 temporarily increasing the supply of treasuries makes this kind of deception easier it helps remove market and regulator discipline
7304528 you have to give credit to a guy with the nerve to come here with black bears on the outside and the fomc on the inside and be this critical of the federal reserve
7304529 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7304530 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7304531 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7304532 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7304533 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7304534 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while
7304535 in the case of bear stearns it is not clear from publicly available information how much contagion there would have been had it been allowed to fail
7304536 i ring my contacts and theyre all in abu dhabi
7304537 these are the guys the sovereign wealth funds want to work with guys so far off the radar they make the hedge funds look transparent
7304538 people say we are in a downturn like the early 1990s
7304539 i think its going to be worse than that were in for something like the 1970s or even the 1930s
7304540 greenspan was part of a new political culture that started in the 1990s and violated the integrity of his predecessor paul volcker
7304541 feel good politicians like bill clinton and tony blair started telling people only what they wanted to hear
7304542 stoking up the economy on debt was a way for the west to sustain an unsustainable standard of living
7304543 in this sense the financial system wasnt the cause of the problems it was the messenger
7304544 if the chinese wont revalue it the us needs to talk about import tariffs
7304545 regulatory reform proper incentives for bankers these are valid issues
7304546 the root cause of financial market excesses on both the upside and downside of the cycle is collective human behaviour unbridled optimism on the upside and fear bordering on panic on the downside
7304547 to think that the us will not come back is short sighted we are building in the us while competition there is weak
7304548 i dont think it will be too bad the stock market is down about 20 maybe it needs to go down by 30 40 and there could be one more shock a large european company could fail but my instinct is for a market upturn by the end of the year
7304549 the final tally will depend in large measure on us house prices and the broader stabilisation of the credit markets
7304550 the mpc needs to respond to recessionary not inflationary expectations
7304551 people are worrying about a replay of the wage price spiral
7304552 but that happened 30 years ago and the economy has moved on
7304553 i would be astonished and horrified if the government accepted the tucs advice
7304554 a winter of discontent would ensure they get what they dont want
7304555 many people in the west are full of fear now
7304556 how you deal with the coming changes say half the general motors assembly line moving to china will determine where the downturn comes out
7304557 how much has the west spent on the iraq war
7304558 three trillion dollars bush may have thought he was getting a new source of oil for that money but has he
7304559 the us election is the most important thing happening this autumn a barack obama victory would signal a new beginning to the world
7304560 the west especially america with the entrepreneurial energies of its new immigrants will come back
7304561 what has been done until now has been pretty well done it seems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7304562 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7304563 the stimulus helped to support consumption in the middle part of this year
7304564 one of the things well be experiencing later this year is the withdrawal of that effect leading to economic weakness
7304565 when you can get an adverse feedback loop that argues that what you need to do is act more aggressively
7304566 we will have to see where it will go it is too early to give a comment on that
7304567 this half year weve seen a substantial and sudden uplift in demand for advice on unsecured debt problems
7304568 in the past six weeks it has got even worse we reckon theres been an increase in calls of about 25 per cent
7304569 we make sure households classify debts as priority and non priority when they call for advice
7304570 priority is when you risk losing something like your house or your utilities
7304571 the issue now is the us slowdown and whether it enters a technical recession and what that does to the credit card and unsecured books
7304572 there are signs of increasing strain in the homeowner segment highlighted by the fact that almost 40 per cent of iva proposals are now coming from people who own property
7304573 historically over 50 per cent of struggling homeowners would refinance or remortgage themselves out of trouble but this option is less readily available today
7304574 people are really feeling the squeeze there is definitely some strain there
7304575 banks are opting for debt management plans and have been clamping down on ivas
7304576 it flatters their provisioning policy they would have had to write down an iva almost immediately debt management plans delay the impairment and the banks are likely to lose less
7304577 but for the ones who havent this takes a lot of money off the table
7304578 under none of the scenarios was it contemplated that the government would taking this subsidy into account make a net profit from taking northern rock into the public sector
7304579 ministers considered that this share of the returns was disproportionate to the share of risk borne by the taxpayer or in other words the private provider would receive an excessive return relative to the risk taken
7304580 the value of the additional equity will be reflected in the sale price for northern rock on return to the private sector
7304581 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here
7304582 there are a lot of cross currents here youve got oil financials and politics coming together and its hard to see that combining in a way thats a perfect storm to the downside or a perfect environment to the upside
7304583 i think its important that the week ahead is the last week in august and so whatever happens we should take it with a grain of salt
7304584 what weve been saying about housing is just show us some stability were looking for a silver lining
7304585 the second quarter gdp data will be revised higher because of the trade numbers but the market will be looking more closely at some of the more forward looking data to see what will happen next what is the extent of the economic slowdown going forward
7304586 china may still grow significantly faster than developed economies for at least another one or two decades
7304587 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
7304588 we are approaching a solvency crisis that we think is about to result in an avalanche of asset sales
7304589 the global economy is in a tough spot caught between sharply slowing demand in many advanced economies and rising inflation everywhere
7304590 the slowdown has reached such a wide range of countries that theyre now feeding on one another
7304591 the u k has been really soft for the last six months
7304592 western europe overall has been flat weve not seen the growth weve seen in the last few years
7304593 the year 2009 in europe is going to look significantly worse than 2008
7304594 it was too hot not to cool down as the song goes
7304595 a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year
7304596 its the rest of the world going down not the united states going up
7304597 exports have been sort of holding us out of the graveyard
7304598 that may begin to peter out a little bit if the dollar continues to climb
7304599 if the rest of the world economy slows the demand just isnt going to be there
7304600 when i see the headlines i worry but when i look at my order book i stop worrying
7304601 when china decides they want to build a car somebody runs a steel mill with coal and iron ore out of australia and they mine it with caterpillar dump trucks which are full of timken bearings
7304602 what is driving our success is the globalization of markets
7304603 the global slowdown is going to create some headwind for the united states
7304604 because managements perception of the companys value is meaningfully different than the investors perception
7304605 solvency concerns like trading errors do not age well we believe the longer the market frets about lehmans balance sheet exposures the more likely counterparties are to pull back from the firm which could cause lasting damage to its franchise
7304606 investors are convinced that this company cannot survive or that it will be forced into taking huge losses that will devastate book value
7304607 my point was that we had gone eight years since the last serious problem in capital markets and that thered been all of this innovation
7304608 no one would have predicted the russian default in 98 or some of the things that happened in asia
7304609 i cant remember when treasury has been so deeply involved in the structure of securities markets
7304610 one of my management principles is to define your job expansively
7304611 hank paulson blew a supreme opportunity to make a substantial reform
7304612 hes caved in to the political pressure in washington which is in essence keep fannie and freddie largely as they are
7304613 he said the culture at goldman sachs was not hierarchical and that people learned to work in teams and to work with people well
7304614 when youre advising a principal you need to have a role where you are candid
7304615 but outside theres never daylight between you and your boss
7304616 i was hopeful wed get the reform and we wouldnt have to use the plan
7304617 bringing the federal reserve into it brings a measure of independence that is consoling to the congress
7304618 its important to have a secretary of the treasury that the president would listen to and respect
7304619 of the problems that were created by the reckless deregulation that led to the subprime crisis and the neglect of affordable housing that has marked republican rule in congress this package of measures is the best response we could make
7304620 this will begin to lay the groundwork for a turnaround in the housing market
7304621 the time to judge economic policy management is in times of crisis and i think he has brought the right skills to bear
7304622 even if i dont necessarily agree with everything hes done i think hes been incredibly thoughtful incredibly careful and a real leader
7304623 we recognized quite early on that if there was some concern or lack of confidence in their access to capital this could create a serious problem
7304624 but we certainly couldnt go to congress and ask for these powers that would make it a self fulfilling prophecy or we wouldnt have gotten the powers
7304625 hes used the fact that everyone in washington goes out of town as his strength because he stays in town and then works the phones and then gets a plan that he can unveil monday morning
7304626 as the secretary has said we have no plans to use these authorities
7304627 we continue to stay in touch with the companies and their regulators and are staying on top of the situation
7304628 he really likes to sit down go around the room and get conflicting views
7304629 theres never shading with hank in the sense that i think you always are getting the straight picture
7304630 i dont believe that you get things done just by getting together and having a drink or laughing or interacting personally while thats never a negative you need to bring value
7304631 theyve worked with me enough that they knew i wouldnt say it unless i believed it
7304632 you cant have a discussion if one side doesnt want to talk about it
7304633 my objective and we put out a series of reports and continue to has been to depoliticize the issue and do some things that make it easier for the next person sitting in the seat
7304634 behind the scenes theyre always trying to prop things up
7304635 i think barney frank sort of likes him which to anybody who may have believed in the free markets ought to raise questions
7304636 its another way to get liquidity into the housing market and thats very important if we want a turnaround
7304637 if we get the issuers the dealers and the investors to move at the same time nobody has the risk of going first
7304638 a big part of my life will be devoted to conservation and the environment
7304639 the only thing that isnt a certainty is whether that will be my primary or sole focus

7304667 the ana are very well equipped to conduct counter insurgency operations
7304668 the fact is the ana are afghans they speak the language and understand the culture they are able to do a great job of counter insurgency because the people truly identify with them
7304669 our mp platoon has done an absolutely fabulous job mentoring the ana and anp and their hard effort has paid off by making this transition possible

7304701 it was a constant struggle because its such a whitewash town in a sense
7304702 last week there was much excitement over the news that an independent ticket featuring michael bloomberg and ron paul would be placed on the ballot in virginia this was eventually shot down because the ticket was to be replaced by the constitution partys ticket
7304703 now in louisiana a similar but more exciting thing is happening
7304704 mr rockwell we hope that you will permit us to place your name on the ballot beside heroic constitutionalist ron paul we feel that youve done much in the service to liberty and recieved little in return you neednt sign any paperwork or even agree to be on the ballot
7304705 after the season last year in the offseason we actually did our own study and we gathered as much information as we could around the country and we are under the national average per team and our recovery is actually faster and more lasting
7304706 most of our linemen they are having an injury that is called linemans shoulder now where the labrum in back because the force is getting so strong it is actually causing that labrum to tear which is the equivalent of like a wet piece of newspaper and so i think it is a natural occurrence as bodies get bigger and bigger
7304707 again our numbers say that we are below the average and our recoveries have been faster and have held longer and most of it happens when the shoulder is outside the body frame so i think a lot is too strong a term but is it something every coach has to consider now it is

7304886 although it looks like your typical first person shooter bioshock is one of the freshest gaming experiences in years expertly blending addictive gameplay with deft storytelling but this is no art house cult game it does it all while staying within the confines of polished mass market entertainment
7304887 bioshock is an intensely beautiful game the textures and artwork are high quality and are used very sparingly there are no repeated rooms every single chamber in rapture looks different from the last and has been intricately detailed with individualized set pieces the late 50s style posters that decorate the walls add an authentic period ambience and also subtly foreshadow elements of the story
7304888 bioshock is one of the scariest games ive ever played thanks both to the creepy atmosphere and a few very specifically chosen freak out moments
7304889 but everything is redeemed in the end with a plot twist that not only turns the games story on its head but is actually a wry commentary on the single mindedly violent nature of videogames in general i wont spoil it here but bioshocks politically charged plot will be discussed for years to come

7304958 interessanterweise sehen wir jetzt bei allen drei teams einen ziemlich gro en unterschied zwischen den beiden fahrern
7304959 mir ist auch nicht ganz klar warum das so ist aber es ist eindeutig das haben wir hier wieder gesehen
7304960 vielleicht sind die mit den schwarzen haaren schneller was wei ich
7304961 nick hatte f r vier runden mehr benzin an bord als robert da gab es leute im feld die deutlich l nger fuhren
7304962 fahrer sind kein thema dazu werde ich mich im moment nicht u ern
7304963 wir brauchen dazu zwei autos die in der lage sind ordentlich zu punkten
7304964 nick sitzt sowieso bei den testfahrten in monza an zwei tagen in auto aber da wird das paket f r monza ausprobiert vielleicht testet man da speziell die eine oder andere sache aber dass man extra einen gesamten tag f r ihn testet das sehe ich nicht
7304965 wenn ein fahrer strauchelt dann muss ich versuchen diese schw che zu berwinden und zwar mit den personen und mit dem material das ich im team habe
7304966 das hei t im fall des fahrers mit ihm arbeiten so wie wir dies auch schon in den vergangenen monaten getan haben er muss an sich arbeiten er muss sich mit den ingenieuren zusammensetzen die daten analysieren und ber seinen fahrstil nachdenken er muss versuchen herauszufinden woran es liegt
7304967 wir k nnen ihm dann auch einen testtag geben auch das haben wir schon gemacht um zu versuchen etwas zu ndern man muss eigentlich nichts anderes tun als wenn es woanders brennt wenn das auto langsam ist dann muss ich an anderer stelle analysieren dieses problem hatten wir im januar als das auto auf anhieb nicht die erwarteten rundenzeiten fuhr so etwas findet man nicht ber nacht in dem fall ist der nick ganz offensichtlich noch nicht ber den berg
7304968 wenn ich gestern die zweite runde im zweiten qualifying teil angeschaut habe dann ist es v llig klar dass er es drauf hat
7304969 mir ist er bekannt aber wir reden nicht dar ber
7304970 ich bin eigentlich schon zuversichtlich was die schnellen rennen angeht ich glaube dass das auto dort passt nun m ssen wir einmal abwarten wie die ergebnisse aussehen aber ich bin zuversichtlich
7304971 wir haben f r spa und monza noch einiges im programm
7304972 es ist f r uns dieses jahr nicht so eindeutig sagen zu k nnen dass uns die langsamen oder die schnelleren strecken besser liegen zu beginn der saison waren wir in langsamen kurven besonders gut als wir dann mit hohen erwartungen nach monaco kamen war das dann gar nicht so mittlerweile habe ich eher den eindruck dass wir in schnellen kurven dabei sind
7304973 ungarn kann man streichen das war ein echtes streich resultat wenn ich mir dieses wochenende und das qualifying anschaue und man dort das benzin herausgerechnet dann war der robert nur um eine zehntelsekunde hinter hamilton und massa im rennen war es deutlich mehr da waren es so drei bis f nf zehntelsekunden
7304974 ich habe beim start den motor fast abgew rgt und war dadurch in der ersten kurve nur mehr zehnter dann habe ich versucht mich schritt f r schritt nach vor zu arbeiten dabei habe ich nat rlich auch von einigen ausritten meiner konkurrenten profitiert
7304975 beim diesem rennen habe ich mir nat rlich einen besseren platz gew nscht wenn man am start als sechster wegf hrt und dann nur sechster wird ist das nicht befriedigend
7304976 es war aber insgesamt ein gutes rennen wobei das auto jetzt besser liegt als zuletzt immerhin war ich mit den pl tzen neun und heute mit sechs zweimal in den punkter ngen und habe einen platz gutgemacht
7304977 estou muito feliz pois percebo que venho melhorando a cada prova a cada ano que passa
7304978 depois de uma corrida horr vel na hungria sensacional chegar aqui espanha e fazer tudo isso n o posso pedir mais nada

7304983 to those people who are ill and to the families who have lost loved ones i offer my deepest and sincerest sympathies
7304984 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7304985 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy

7304992 its time for low income families across america to stand up and stand together
7304993 we need to demand that our voices are heard and that the daily human rights violations we are experiencing are exposed and ended
7304994 now is the time for all of us to come together
7304995 its time to bring about the real change that working families need
7304996 its time to turn the page its time to bring about the real change that americas working families need that change is building an economy that rewards not just wealth but work and the workers who create it
7304997 whatever divided us in the past doesnt mean diddly squat
7304998 somethings got to change and weve got make it happen
7304999 the men and women of the nalc are ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with the men and women of the apwu to make sure that it does
7305000 have not discussed the thought of merger what we have done is taken the first step in a long journey that could lead to an improved relationship
7305001 were appalled that the u s postal service has entered into an approved shipper program partnership with the franchising operation
7305002 those of you that have been around long enough will remember that betty evans one of the societys past presidents used to have these fancy garage sales named excess freight and baggage she thought it was a cute name given the fact it was being held in the freight room of the depot i will be following in her tradition and will be having a good old fashioned garage sale

7305007 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7305008 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7305009 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7305010 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7305011 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7305012 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7305013 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7305014 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7305015 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7305016 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7305017 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7305018 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7305019 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7305020 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7305021 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7305022 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7305023 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7305024 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7305025 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7305026 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7305027 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7305028 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7305029 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7305030 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7305031 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7305032 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7305033 ah je komt van de kapper je kortgeknipte haartjes hebben een rossige schijn

7305035 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7305036 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7305037 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible

7305042 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7305043 this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit pissed off
7305044 when that dreadful day comes the audience will be ready for it
7305045 the reason the finale of the last series worked so well is that it was top secret
7305046 it s a free country and people are entitled to say this is richard and judy going off into the dim antechamber of television but i would ask them whats the future digital or analogue of course we are going to get smaller audiences but this is the challenge of the moment
7305047 most people are desperate to be famous and would do anything
7305048 it appeals to the mentality of people who stop to watch after an accident
7305049 the wonderful thing about the olympics is seeing people become famous because they have talent what a lovely change
7305050 it is more fulfilling of course because it concerns talent the beatles didnt make it because of me but because of the songs they wrote
7305051 we have had a lot of complaints about the gassing of chicks from the germans this has gone all round the world and the one country that had a problem with it
7305052 i wanted to stand up and say hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up it was a very unwise thing to say i was shocked
7305053 we work very closely with german tv and the german book publisher and we love all germans
7305054 i was driven to tell a certain kind of story about global consciousness and interconnectivity i asked can people with these powers find each other defeat evil and save the world it was important to have people in the show that werent just blonde haired blue eyed californians
7305055 our relationship with our audience is tenuous but they are passionate intense involved and yes obsessive
7305056 i dont think the executive branch has authority to say how and when funding is distributed
7305057 money shall be drawn from the state treasury only pursuant to an appropriation made in accordance with law
7305058 may review and approve the initial allocation of expenditures for each appropriation for a fiscal year
7305059 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7305060 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7305061 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7305062 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7305063 un homme au parcours remarquable un homme fondamentalement honn te et cet homme est joe biden

7305069 joe et moi sommes amis depuis de nombreuses ann es et nous nous connaissons tr s bien je pense donc quil obama a fait un tr s bon choix
7305070 il ny a personne qui critique davantage le manque dexp rience de barack obama que joe biden
7305071 john mccain na pas ce genre de pr occupations il doit se demander autour de laquelle de ses sept tables de cuisine il doit sasseoir
7305072 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7305073 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7305074 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7305075 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7305076 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7305077 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7305078 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7305079 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards

7305090 arriver la construction dun nouveau projet qui rassemble tout le monde
7305091 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7305092 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7305093 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7305094 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7305095 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7305096 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
7305097 so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7305098 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7305099 this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7305100 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit pissed off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines i think hell always probably tend to be around 40
7305101 theres basically a blanket ban on anyone over the age of 35 playing the doctor
7305102 its to allow the show to connect to its younger audience
7305103 there was a death we are investigating that to see if it is linked were doing extra due diligence
7305104 theres been no indication that its been shipped anywhere within our region
7305105 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7305106 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7305107 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7305108 this is very simple our sport is about which athlete stops the time by pushing the touchpad
7305109 in our sport we dont have photo finishes like in athletics in our sport its who touches first water is a different element
7305110 if there was no wind i could probably add a couple of meters now it comes backward
7305111 i do think canada can get to the top 12 in 2012 but its going to take a big effort i do think there is a need for more investment
7305112 there were a number of events out there where we got a silver and i thought dammit just short of the gold
7305113 our ultimate objective at some time has to be how many gold medals will we win were certainly talking about that a lot more
7305114 we would appeal to prime minister stephen harper to give us the extra 6 million dollars wed asked for in the last budget
7305115 wed asked for 30 million lets look at the extra 50 or 60 million were going to need over the next few years to try and build the kinds of programs theyve got in britain and australia and the united states
7305116 if were going to play with the big boys if were going to be a g8 nation lets be g8 at all levels
7305117 canadas athletes rose to the occasion providing exciting and memorable moments which included personal bests and new national records
7305118 canadians watched your outstanding performances with great pride and excitement and we salute you
7305119 today i like all canadian sports fans am looking back with pride at the many memorable performances of our fellow canadians at the 2008 olympic games
7305120 its definitely hard to compete with the top countries especially when you look at diving trampoline and gymnastics
7305121 it was so difficult to compete against the chinese athletes here and the programs they have in place are just amazing
7305122 funding has to come early enough that theres time for the athletes to prepare and have access to everything they need and the support they need to compete with the top countries in the world were already seeing small improvements and hopefully its going to continue that way
7305123 we made a decision some time ago to start targeting the money and we realized we couldnt be a mile wide and an inch deep
7305124 australia targets the sports where they know they can get medals
7305125 im not sure we can ever be as targeted as that and i dont think canadians would accept that we have a certain egalitarian nature that is going to demand that every kid gets a chance but we can target more than we have in the past
7305126 the more you see of these tremendous young people the more you want to see of them but if you dont see them and you dont know who they are there isnt that passion to watch them
7305127 its tough enough in the ups and downs of the olympics world its another game in the ups and downs of the political world
7305128 athletes are training to perform in the sports world we would be very careful how they might be used in the political field

7305151 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
7305152 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth

7305218 weve certainly only got ourselves to blame four goals and four errors really
7305219 its disappointing i think we were brighter and we were better tonight than last week but you feel more disappointed that you got nothing for it
7305220 we had quite a few chances so were certainly creating them and to score two at home that should be good enough to win
7305221 its only two down though weve got 19 to go
7305222 i thought we played better football yet were on the end of a 4 2 thumping which is very disappointing
7305223 we were well aware of their strengths but i guess we just didnt deal with it as well as we should have
7305224 in those conditions we tried to bypass the midfield and once we got that happening we knew wed cause a lot of trouble and thats exactly how it worked out
7305225 we just need the game so we can mould the test team and give them a game before we play a test against australia
7305226 they want to back a winning side but we never go out there to lose on purpose and its a new playing style im trying to get out there rome wasnt built in a day and i ask the people to be patient to give us more time
7305227 it was all about execution because the chances were there but we cannot make mistakes like we did today its unacceptable for any international player
7305228 the guys have really come to the party its quite unnatural for them and some of them have felt a bit out of their depth but theyve really got stuck in and been good sports about it really
7305229 of course he spends most of his time in speedos anyway so hes pretty comfortable in his underwear
7305230 im supportive of sport in general and especially sport in wellington and glad to help
7305231 its awesome im busy can always be busier but im lucky to be as busy as i am now i wrestle pretty much every weekend and thats all i can ask for
7305232 everybodys opinion is just something that motivated me to try and up my game in every aspect if people thought i was missing that one thing obviously there was something that wasnt connecting me to everybody which is the point in this business is to connect with everybody no matter who they are
7305233 right now things are going good theres a decent amount of young guys that are looking to work hard and earn their stripes and take the next step to become a better performer and a better pro wrestler so i think right now all the companies are doing sort of what they need to do to work together and help and keep everyone busy because thats the only way you can really learn in this business is to wrestle as much as you possibly can in front of different people and different crowds
7305234 there are a handful of groups that are doing right for this business in florida im pretty impressed with it actually
7305235 just having the opportunity to do the things ive done in ring of honor thats the first major test if i can stay there as long as i possibly can and make it there i can see no reason why i couldnt go anywhere else and stay for just as long
7305236 sometimes when that camera gets in your face i just lock up im not going to deny it its truthful and sometimes things dont come off the way i really feel about them its like anything anybody does like an actor tom cruise wasnt tom cruise right off the bat its all a matter of just finding your niche and finding out whats comfortable to you and what can put you into that character the easies thats the only way that you do get better
7305237 when you work with people you teach them the things you know and i try not to teach anything outside of my boundaries because obviously i dont know it if i dont have an understanding of it i wont try to teach somebody that it brings you back to your first day your second day so as you teach the people you kind of go through those steps again and you catch a lot of your flaws that you were making and didnt realize you were making because you havent been critiqued specifically as you are critiquing this person
7305238 it was a great opportunity when i was there and my face was on tv a lot in my four or five months that i was actually going on tv so i appreciated the opportunity there
7305239 me and austin aries got suspended we were asked to leave a ring of honor show early and miss it and fly into orlando for the ppv we let them know that we would be making it to the pay per view but we had to fulfill our commitment to ring of honor as well we ended up making it to the pay per view just late and they suspended us because of that it was their decision and it was right in their book so im not going to argue with them about that
7305240 its just something in this business if you say you are going to be there you want to be there no matter what thats the way that people can believe in you and trust you in a business where trust is very important
7305241 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time

7305244 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
7305245 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
7305246 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense

7305249 you become a writer by writing it is a yoga
7305250 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it
7305251 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that
7305252 i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7305253 i tried 100 per cent he got the lead a silly lead at the start of it i was still asleep
7305254 im disgusted with myself for that thats my only regret in the whole competition the first round but i gave it everything i had in the last three
7305255 i had that in the back of my head but i didnt let it affect my game i just threw everything i had
7305256 he caught me with a couple of good shots i caught him body shots as well that probably didnt score
7305257 but im not going to start making excuses ive had a great campaign i want to thank all the supporters here and at home thats it thats the end of the fairytale for now
7305258 im happy im very very happy it would have been nice to take the gold its always the same when you win something you want more
7305259 he boxed well himself he had a hard draw himself he done well and beat the russian and kazakh you cant take it away from him he done it there tonight
7305260 while the nation hails his resignation this is a moment to reflect on the challenges ahead as we move towards an order of parliamentary supremacy his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with its governance agenda of providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
7305261 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
7305262 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation

7305282 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7305283 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
7305284 include that drilling let it compete and see where we come down on it and if that in fact is a good alternative then that is something that we should do

7305301 well its very obvious like i said when i go home and i travel down a road that used to have traffic jams every day and theres no traffic on it anymore its like where did everybody go the last one out turns the lights off theres nobody there its kind of scary its really scary its not very cool the economy is what it is a few racers aint going to change it but what we can do to support american manufacturers were going to do
7305302 of the new development projects one area that may receive greater attention is the public transport system while the regional development corridors would likely receive greater priority in the current budget with particular focus on sabah and sarawak
7305303 the key focus will be on measures to assist households cope with the rising cost of living
7305304 possible measures include cuts in personal income tax rates and raising thresholds for taxable income which will help middle income households
7305305 cuts in employee epf contribution rates to about nine per cent could free up disposable income for households without straining the governments finances
7305306 although the economic case for modest rate hikes to anchor inflation expectations remains intact policymakers appear to be focused on the risks to growth and believe that slowdown will in itself take care of inflation
7305307 the recent asymmetric adjustments to the petrol pricing scheme will ensure a quicker pass through of sliding crude oil prices into domestic crude oil prices
7305308 the cost of setting up this branch would be much higher than the conventional ones
7305309 infrastructure will help us test wireless phone banking wireless atms before we roll these services out to other branches
7305310 and this goes for other usage of energy for an aircraft during takeoff the figure is only eight per cent while there is only 35 per cent of burnt coal in a power plant that becomes electricity the rest again is lost as heat
7305311 that is entirely feasible provided that they apply new technology and we apply discipline in the use of energy if people experience a true value of energy then they will be more amenable to reducing energy
7305312 we will also work with governments and advocate the need for more effective co2 regulations
7305313 it would be cheaper to operate if the stations were located near a gas pipeline if there is no pipeline it has to be supplied using trucks which is costly and a bit of a hassle
7305314 there is a big market for islamic estate planning as 95 per cent of the muslim community has yet to undertake estate planning
7305315 our forecast of rm500 million hibah asset value is achievable as we are strengthening our network and the raising of awareness among the people on the importance of estate planning
7305316 am i at the summit now nope this isnt it maybe its that next bit
7305317 bob was killed instantly and both of us got out without a scratch you dont think im fatalistic if its not your time to go youre not going to go
7305318 i think if for some reason something doesnt get done i will personally ask the governor to call a special session to deal with this issue
7305319 this is for those employers that tell the illegal immigrant dont fill out any forms im just going to pay you cash
7305320 when we were designing the latest version of docmetrics we asked our customers and prospects what features they would like to see added to our dynamic pdf forms technology
7305321 based on their feedback we made it a priority to ensure that docmetrics users are able to create fully branded forms that leverage the look and feel of their other marketing materials
7305322 millions and millions of pdf documents are passed along every day and nobody knows whats happening to them
7305323 we have the first application in the world that does that

7305326 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7305327 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7305328 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7305329 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7305330 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7305331 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7305332 this finding means that it is possible to offer simple non invasive screening for patients with a family history of neuroblastoma
7305333 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile
7305334 its an advantage to be able to start with agents that have already been shown to be safe in adults
7305335 together with this current study we are defining the genetic events that underlie this childhood cancer
7305336 better understanding of these biological pathways will guide our efforts to develop more effective treatments
7305337 we want to sell these products in bigger markets after we received positive response from markets in malaysia singapore and the middle east
7305338 we have a variety of plants and herbs in our forest which can be commercialised but the problem is that theyre not well researched and fully tapped
7305339 we plan to launch about 200 products by end 2009
7305340 bsn offers various promotions under islamic banking products including giro i savings account islamic al bai bithaman ajil home loan personal loan scheme and al aiman credit card
7305341 islamic banking is expanding fast and many people including non muslims have accepted it
7305342 in theory this amount is enough to keep us going for about 400 years based on the current rate of consumption but in practice less than half can be recovered by existing technologies
7305343 it needs a lot of advance technologies high investment and a lot of patience
7305344 currently renewable energy is about one per cent of total energy mix it is estimated that by 2050 it could rise to 30 per cent assuming the technological breakthrough required for large scale commercial production is achieved
7305345 even if we achieve this 70 per cent of the energy mix will still depend on fossil fuels and that is a very huge amount
7305346 in order to achieve the rm10 billion target for malaysian furniture export by 2010 set out by the plantation industries and commodities minister we need to build and expand our factories to employ more workers
7305347 if we are having difficulties in getting the workers needless to say it will be difficult to increase our production and output
7305348 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7305349 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7305350 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7305351 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7305352 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7305353 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7305354 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7305355 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7305356 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7305357 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

7305363 i would be a very negligent president if i hadnt put away in a drawer somewhere a plan b
7305364 so well done england and the fa they were missed at the euros so it is only fitting that we ensure their attendance at the world cup by letting them host it
7305365 ultimately it came down to recognising caroline and georginas extraordinary performance at beijing but also taking into account their performance in athens
7305366 there was a very small number of painted vehicles and we understand quite a few of them went through to queenstown for skiing
7305367 its quite clear that it the undie 500 is seen as a magnet
7305368 its much improved on last year our belief has been student behaviour is improving but its still far from acceptable
7305369 its a booze trip it does have something to do with it
7305370 we had done all we could to distance ourselves from this years trip
7305371 there is no doubt the combined efforts of all these agencies resulted in reduced overall levels of disorder
7305372 in the end we remain dependent upon the responsibility of individuals involved
7305373 i dont want to pre empt it but we do know that its not getting any cheaper to participate in the olympics if you fund at the same level you move backwards
7305374 we have got the formula right but lets look at how it can be honed even further
7305375 of course people are hurting because of change in the economy but i think this is an appropriate spend its not just about medals its about encouraging participation that leads to better health and tackling obesity
7305376 if we stay still we will get further behind in our review we have to look for another edge
7305377 howard its on gary page one in green at the bottom
7305378 i dont think new zealanders are going to see 50 to 100 toll roads but i think youll see four or five quite large ones
7305379 we are appalled by this cruel abduction of journalists and call for the immediate release of our colleagues who are being held captive because of their noble work for somali people
7305380 she has to be on the front lines and she has to be with the people to tell their story and the humanitarian side of everything was is huge for amanda to bring that to the light so that people can help
7305381 i heard a voice ordering them to turn the car in a different direction
7305382 my brother in a low tone was trying not to answer my inquiries but made me understood that they were caught in a difficult situation i realized that things had changed and then their voices disappeared
7305383 wherever she is right now i know that shes keeping a positive attitude because shes an innately positive person
7305384 i dont want to use the word fearless but she is a courageous person of course theres apprehension and she did speak about that but she never really used the term fear
7305385 she said she was drawn to the passion of the people who were in these zones in other words if youre in a zone of conflict nothing is taken for granted and you live each moment like it was a lifetime of experience
7305386 she is an intelligent caring and adventurous professional who was well aware of the dangers of the regions she frequented
7305387 she was also aware that her audience was keenly interested in her world perspective and she worked bravely to bring them that perspective
7305388 for those who export it has been and will continue to be through the holiday season a more challenging period for them
7305389 it might be a little worse in the u s but i still think the trend will be to purchasing later and a little bit less and being a little bit more selective with discretionary dollars
7305390 we expect to see continued growth over last year but at a pace that is softer than it was in 2007
7305391 theres no question we have seen a small decline in employment in canada we have seen the cost of gas chew into family budgets but generally factors are still quite positive for canadian consumers
7305392 a lot of people who might not have otherwise been in the market find themselves as the school year starts kicking tires on new devices and new services
7305393 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7305394 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7305395 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7305396 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7305397 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7305398 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7305399 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7305400 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7305401 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7305402 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7305403 ultimately it came down to recognising caroline and georginas extraordinary performance at beijing but also taking into account their performance in athens
7305404 responsible for managing day to day strategy and operations of the national party
7305405 is the extent to which we allow people of faith to be a vibrant active part of the party because that is a longer term benefit with greater implications than what one election may or may not yield
7305406 secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square frederick douglass abraham lincoln william jennings bryan dorothy day martin luther king indeed the majority of great reformers in american history were not only motivated by faith but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause
7305407 i think its wonderful and as a voter i want to know what makes the candidate tick this is a core part of his understanding
7305408 i am on the rise i am the power and not the pig i am on the rise i am the master and not the mastered i am on the rise
7305409 i am on the rise i am on the rise i am on the rise
7305410 i believe as the church believes that marriage is intended for one man and one woman
7305411 people know that i am a reverend but it is completely separate from the work at the dnc
7305412 we had two very important groups of people in the dnc disagreeing with each other
7305413 and i wanted to achieve it in a way that wasnt offensive to the history of the civil rights movement
7305414 i was richly blessed in my life with parents who raised me in a christian home
7305415 require public schools to offer bible literacy as part of their curriculum
7305416 pass a constitutional amendment confirming that all life is a gift from god and should be protected and that life begins at conception
7305417 defeat any efforts to redefine marriage or provide the benefits of marriage to a same sex union
7305418 whether to accept him in our lives how then can we take away choice on other profound issues we dont believe the government should interfere
7305419 the wonderful thing about the democratic party is that we have room for all kinds of opinions
7305420 the intellectuals the egghead types pentecostalism is incomprehensible to them they dont understand the spirit driven i can make the trains run on time and they have a hard time reconciling that with my religion
7305421 i dont want to pre empt it but we do know that its not getting any cheaper to participate in the olympics if you fund at the same level you move backwards
7305422 we have got the formula right but lets look at how it can be honed even further
7305423 of course people are hurting because of change in the economy but i think this is an appropriate spend its not just about medals its about encouraging participation that leads to better health and tackling obesity
7305424 if we stay still we will get further behind in our review we have to look for another edge
7305425 it was a messy affair and the rain right on kick off didnt help and they taranaki put a lot into it
7305426 although we dominated possession pretty much i felt we were just unable to get our game going we didnt have any accuracy in our early kicking and some individuals made a few too many errors i think we made something like 28 unforced errors and they were similar which probably made it a terrible spectacle
7305427 the forwards didnt think they were too bad but the backs thought the ball was like a cake of soap so it was partly conditions and partly coming off the performance against auckland last week mentally we probably werent where we needed to be
7305428 the plan was to kick but not kick a lot but playing taranaki in taranaki is a difficult proposition at the best of times and we wanted to keep the ball out of our half because we didnt want to give them any semblance of an opportunity
7305429 what tended to happen instead was that our kicking game wasnt as accurate as it shouldve been and we put a bit of pressure on ourselves through that but to be fair they were worse if theyd been on song we couldve been under the cosh i think
7305430 i hear horror stories all the time about people mixing the wrong chemicals or starting projects that are really above their skill level
7305431 most accidents can be avoided if people simply use the necessary safety gear and take the time to read instructions
7305432 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days we will cherish forever
7305433 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world
7305434 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7305435 the hills are actually a play on the name hillary but of course they cant but help make us think of the mountains that he loved and of course the scaling of everest
7305436 its lovely thats in a place thats very much visited like st marys and i think people will see it as a great tribute to ed that its here in his home town and a lot of people can view it
7305437 it was a very simple ceremony receiving the banner from st georges chapel in windsor into the church here and it looks highly appropriate seeing it in that setting
7305438 only three new zealanders were ever members of the order of the garter sir keith holyoakes banner is in te papa and lord elworthys banner is in timaru
7305439 this ones here in auckland close to eds home and i think thats really appropriate
7305440 i think its great to have it in a place that the living are part of
7305441 this is the best of times and the worst of times and i am just trying to delve into both those emotions
7305442 my heart aches for my wife and my family but at the same time i am immensely proud of what my team has achieved
7305443 on that final moment it dawned on me what had happened so i grabbed my staff who have been so instrumental in this
7305444 i dont want to pre empt it but we do know that its not getting any cheaper to participate in the olympics if you fund at the same level you move backwards
7305445 we cant let up on the momentum we have gained we have got the formula right but lets look at how it can be honed even further
7305446 absolutely of course people are hurting because of change in the economy but i think this is an appropriate spend its not just about medals its about encouraging participation that leads to better health and tackling obesity
7305447 according to their foster mom they are the best cutest and most social group of puppies to be found
7305448 love pig and friends are very affable raised with children and other dogs
7305449 some days id be walking around and look at all of the people and think i have to be here but why are you all here
7305450 clearly missing the cool ocean breezes and the streets of his hometown
7305451 im not going to sacrifice my life for my art
7305452 the tremendous outpouring of support and financial contributions from the community will help to provide expanded recreational programs for these at risk children and youth for years to come
7305453 i noticed that you havent posted to the blog much i thought maybe your camera was broken
7305454 ganar la medalla de oro en pek n fue algo impresionante algo nico que no se consigue todos los d as la verdad es que estoy muy feliz y contento por haber marcado dos goles a brasil en las semifinales porque para los argentinos este partido es un cl sico
7305455 schalke se trata de un rival muy duro porque todos los equipos alemanes son fuertes no va a ser nada f cil eliminarles pero hay que estar tranquilos y confiar en la victoria
7305456 llegar en plenas condiciones para jugar el partido ahora quiero descansar un poco y pensar de lleno en el encuentro ojal pasemos y nosotros vamos a hacer todo lo posible para conseguirlo
7305457 no ser sencillo y por ello todos debemos estar concentrados por encima de todo tenemos que tener confianza en nosotros mismos hay que afrontar el partido con paciencia y tranquilidad debemos estar concentrados y bien ordenados en el campo porque seguro que vamos a tener muchas ocasiones de gol
7305458 we are still expecting to decline at the upper levels but have one more kindergarten class than we had expected so perhaps things will be turning around somewhat
7305459 the growth in our student population is exciting and a wonderful academic opportunity for students throughout the valley and the county
7305460 we limited ourselves to 40 because we only have so much space being next to the farmers market
7305461 we need to present to health care systems that nosocomial diseases diseases acquired during a hospital stay can be prevented inexpensively and effectively
7305462 you have to surround yourself with the right people who believe that you can cure yourself
7305463 im a registered nurse but i love hearing about this
7305464 la consigna principal es tener paciencia porque podemos darle la vuelta a la eliminatoria no hay que recordar los partidos ante el bolton y el valencia todos los encuentros son diferentes y hablamos de temporadas distintas
7305465 debemos llevar el ritmo del partido y estar metidos en todo momentos en la eliminatoria para conseguir un buen resultado
7305466 es una cuesti n que nos preocupa a todos sabemos que su fuerte en ataque es el juego por alto y debemos tratar de contrarrestarlo
7305467 schalke es un equipo con jugadores de bastante nivel y que cuenta con recambios habr que ver c mo llegan al partido pero debemos ocuparnos de nosotros mismos y tratar de llevar el ritmo de partido
7305468 it opens new horizons for relations based on mutual respect the agreement turns the page on the negative past forever

7305472 the chamber has unhesitatingly concluded that the right to a fair trial which is without doubt a fundamental right includes an entitlement to disclosure of exculpatory material
7305473 the public interest is excluded where its application would deny to the accused the opportunity to establish his or her innocence
7305474 i have been fortunate to have a fantastically varied career working on some of the most high profile cases in the uk and abroad which are often in the public spotlight
7305475 my worst moment was probably in the lockerbie trial when the panel of four judges delivered their verdict of
7305476 is that the same as being japanese or like not at all
7305477 the bombing of the pan am flight was conceived authorized and financed by ali akbar mohtashemi pur the former iranian minister of interior
7305478 the operation was contracted to ahmad jibril for 1 million
7305479 i still agree with that we felt quite sure that this was a pflp thing

7305482 we dont want him in a white house he says he has seven kitchen tables we dont want to give him an eighth kitchen table we underst amp he has a wonderful life this is a great country but millions of americans at this hour are suffering through a housing market that is colldrunk newssed housing foreclosures so when john mccain gets up in a morning amp leaves his house to lock his door he has to shuffle through a number of keys to figure out which key works in which door in which home hes at at any given time
7305483 what concerns me more than not exactly knowing how many homes he has bob amp jesses right it shows hes out of touch but when he said in january that americans have done well under a george bush economy hes so out of touch hardly any american except people who make five six hundred thous amp dollars plus have done well under this economy wages are down everything else is up americans middle class working americans are getting slaughtered under this economy how could he have said that
7305484 if im still enjoying it and doing well then why not
7305485 itll be the first time ive spent a good chunk of time there for a while
7305486 im looking forward to it being a kiwi at home again
7305487 every time we do something you tell me americans will do this and will do that i want to tell you something very clear dont worry about american pressure on israel we the jewish people control america and the americans know it
7305488 all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others
7305489 of course the media are free to go to tibet
7305490 but as you know due to the recent riots that are happening in tibet there is a limitation not only for the media but also for the general public to go to tibet so i think maybe you need approval but in general the media in the past and the present and the future are free to go to tibet
7305491 the ioc would have liked to have seen the protest zones genuinely being used but its not an area that falls within our direct remit
7305492 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7305493 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7305494 it was just a matter of us weathering the storm in the first half and alex and ross got us off to a good start with some great yardage
7305495 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7305496 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7305497 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7305498 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7305499 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7305500 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7305501 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7305502 who are open to doing something on the production side
7305503 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7305504 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7305505 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7305506 if im still enjoying it and doing well then why not
7305507 itll be the first time ive spent a good chunk of time there for a while
7305508 im looking forward to it being a kiwi at home again
7305509 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7305510 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7305511 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7305512 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7305513 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7305514 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7305515 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7305516 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7305517 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7305518 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7305519 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7305520 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7305521 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7305522 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7305523 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7305524 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7305525 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7305526 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7305527 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7305528 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7305529 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7305530 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7305531 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7305532 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7305533 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7305534 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7305535 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7305536 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7305537 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7305538 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7305539 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7305540 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7305541 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7305542 so youre ok with drastically increased capital gains taxes and a 45 death tax
7305543 i certainly would not go above what existed under bill clinton which was 28
7305544 estamos alinhados como pensamento da medicina preventiva e da promo o da sa de
7305545 they probably deserved the shield after the way they have played all season but we turned up on the day and played better
7305546 we have been just a goal behind them all season today we played more consistently
7305547 it was our worst performance they played well and put all the pressure on us
7305548 yay redos its taken us a few years but we have finally done it
7305549 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7305550 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7305551 meeting di rimini il programma degli spettacoli il sole 24 ore
7305552 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7305553 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7305554 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7305555 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7305556 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7305557 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7305558 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7305559 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7305560 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7305561 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7305562 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

7305564 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7305565 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7305566 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7305567 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7305568 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7305569 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7305570 un magazine paga 200 000 sterline per le foto e mel b replica le nozze con stephen belafonte
7305571 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7305572 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7305573 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7305574 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

7305585 there will be a few that may not but for the most part i think that will happen
7305586 here i was on the day before the convention starts on c span talking about how barack obama is going to win wisconsin and the presidency
7305587 we are appalled by this cruel abduction of journalists and call for the immediate release of our colleagues who are being held captive because of their noble work for somali people
7305588 she has to be on the front lines and she has to be with the people to tell their story and the humanitarian side of everything was is huge for amanda to bring that to the light so that people can help
7305589 i heard a voice ordering them to turn the car in a different direction
7305590 my brother in a low tone was trying not to answer my inquiries but made me understood that they were caught in a difficult situation i realized that things had changed and then their voices disappeared
7305591 wherever she is right now i know that shes keeping a positive attitude because shes an innately positive person
7305592 i dont want to use the word fearless but she is a courageous person of course theres apprehension and she did speak about that but she never really used the term fear
7305593 she said she was drawn to the passion of the people who were in these zones in other words if youre in a zone of conflict nothing is taken for granted and you live each moment like it was a lifetime of experience
7305594 she is an intelligent caring and adventurous professional who was well aware of the dangers of the regions she frequented
7305595 she was also aware that her audience was keenly interested in her world perspective and she worked bravely to bring them that perspective
7305596 it is a red light telling us that something is beginning to go wrong with the quality of water

7305598 its a total diss to senator clinton in my opinion
7305599 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7305600 the simple message to the women who voted for hillary clinton is if you liked the last eight years under george w bush youre going to love the next four under john mccain
7305601 lets be honest its the most disastrous presidency weve had in modern american history and john mccain has said there are not a lot of significant issues that he disagrees with george w bush on
7305602 i suspect hillary clinton will be the good soldier and praise obama and rally her supporters to obama but the fact that he doesnt speak until the fourth night of the convention and that her supporters have significant roles on the first three nights could be risky
7305603 clinton and her supporters will be whooping it up on the convention floor for the first three nights while the obama backers look askance at them out of the corner of their eye waiting for him to take to the stage on the fourth and final night
7305604 race has always been a crucial issue in american politics and its one of the elephants in the room but there are a number of elephants in the room that obama has to deal with
7305605 hes still relatively new on the political scene and hes still introducing himself to the american people while theres an ongoing war so people wonder about his foreign policy and military affairs credentials and thats what selecting senator joe biden as his running mate was all about
7305606 there are a significant number of whites who wonder how can a black candidate not be terribly mad about the treatment of blacks in america over the course of history and what that anger could mean in terms of his governance

7305613 think to yourself do i need it for a checking account
7305614 are there minimum balance fees for the kind of account that you want if it is a checking account are there checking account fees and does that change depending on the number of checks you write
7305615 if you are planning to use atm machines and planning to make deposits or withdrawals in atm machines are there fees that are charged
7305616 those fees can range anywhere between 30 to 40 overdraft protection is often included as a courtesy but is a feature of the account a consumer needs to affirmatively opt out of
7305617 overdraft fees in the u s total billions of dollars so thats something consumers have to be aware of is that a feature that they think would be an advantage or a disadvantage
7305618 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7305619 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
7305620 include that drilling let it compete and see where we come down on it and if that in fact is a good alternative then that is something that we should do

7305743 okay boys today im going to teach you about the sacrament of confession
7305744 that when we go to confession we are kneeling down not before a priest but were kneeling down by the cross of her son and that when we are truly sorry for our sins and we confess our sins the blood he shed flows down over us and washes us free from all sins
7305745 oh dont be angry dont be angry i didnt mean to blurt it out
7305746 were not angry were just amazed you have seen her again
7305747 she told me that if you doubted me or showed hesitancy i was to remind you that lying in a ditch in holland in 1940 you made a vow to her which shes still waiting for you to keep
7305748 you should not be afraid to go to confession youre really telling god your sins not this priest or any priest were telling god our sins
7305749 you know the lady said that confession is something like a telephone we talk through the priest to god and god talks back to us through the priest
7305750 the lady told me that in communion i will only see what looks like a piece of bread but she told me that that is really and truly her son and that he will be with me just for a few moments as he was with her before he was born in bethlehem and that i should spend my time like she did in all her time with him in loving him adoring him thanking him praising him and asking him for blessings i shouldnt be bothered by anybody else or anything else but i should spend those few minutes with him

7305756 what have i done wrong these past weeks that god would refuse me my going home
7305757 why why must i still remain here for two weeks
7305758 maybe our blessed mother wants you to offer this denial of being with her for his conversion
7305759 why dont you offer to god every moment you are separated from her for this prisoner so that he will not be separated from god for all eternity
7305760 that prisoner hated me before but oh father how he hates me now
7305761 ive never seen anyone go to his death as joyfully and happily even the official witnesses and the newspaper reporters were amazed they said they couldnt understand how anyone could go and sit in the electric chair actually beaming with happiness
7305762 father i will remember you and whenever you have a request ask me and i will ask her
7305763 this man was the filthiest most immoral person i had ever come across
7305764 remember that black man claude who i hated so much well hes standing there he pointed over in that corner and behind him with one hand on each shoulder is the blessed mother and claude said to me i offered my death in union with christ on the cross for your salvation she has obtained for you this gift to see your place in hell if you do not repent i was shown my place in hell and thats when i screamed

7305769 virgin mother who brought forth the king of the whole world
7305770 that she has brought forth god as man and even as supreme king
7305771 we should realize that mary means lady in the syrian language
7305772 by the grace of the holy and consubstantial trinity and by the prayers of mary our lady the holy and glorious virgin and mother of god
7305773 the queen of mortal man the most holy mother of god
7305774 today he transports from her earthly dwelling as queen of the human race his ever virgin mother from whose womb he the living god took on human form
7305775 the queen of the entire human race faithful to the exact meaning of her name who is exalted above all things save only god himself
7305776 be enthroned lady for it is fitting that you should sit in an exalted place since you are a queen and glorious above all kings
7305777 o my lady my sovereign you who rule over me mother of my lord
7305778 our lady truly and in a proper sense the mother of god
7305779 who is always vigilant to intercede with the king whom she bore
7305780 because the virgin mary was raised to such a lofty dignity as to be the mother of the king of kings it is deservedly and by every right that the church has honored her with the title of queen
7305781 o mother of god today thou art carried into heaven on the chariots of the cherubim the seraphim wait upon thee and the ranks of the heavenly army bow before thee
7305782 o just o most blessed joseph since thou art sprung from a royal line thou hast been chosen from among all mankind to be spouse of the pure queen who in a way which defies description will give birth to jesus the king
7305783 i shall sing a hymn to the mother the queen whom i joyously approach in praise gladly celebrating her wonders in song
7305784 the queen stood at thy right hand in golden vesture surrounded with beauty
7305785 today the virgin mary ascends into heaven rejoice because she reigns with christ forever
7305786 he shall be called the son of the most high and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of david his father and he shall reign in the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end
7305787 when she became mother of the creator she truly became queen of every creature
7305788 near the cross of our lord jesus christ there stood sorrowful the blessed mary queen of heaven and queen of the world
7305789 just as christ because he redeemed us is our lord and king by a special title so the blessed virgin also is our queen on account of the unique manner in which she assisted in our redemption by giving of her own substance by freely offering him for us by her singular desire and petition for and active interest in our salvation
7305790 in order that she might become a partner in the redemption of the human race
7305791 it was she who free of the stain of actual and original sin and ever most closely bound to her son on golgotha offered that son to the eternal father together with the complete sacrifice of her maternal rights and maternal love like a new eve for all the sons of adam stained as they were by his lamentable fall
7305792 what can be more sublime than your joy o virgin mother what more noble than this grace which you alone have received from god
7305793 your honor and dignity surpass the whole of creation your greatness places you above the angels
7305794 limitless is the difference between gods servants and his mother
7305795 showered her with heavenly gifts and graces from the treasury of his divinity so far beyond what he gave to all the angels and saints that she was ever free from the least stain of sin she is so beautiful and perfect and possesses such fullness of innocence and holiness that under god a greater could not be dreamed and only god can comprehend the marvel
7305796 does she approach the problem of our salvation and is solicitous for the whole human race made queen of heaven and earth by the lord exalted above all choirs of angels and saints and standing at the right hand of her only a son jesus christ our lord she intercedes powerfully for us with a mothers prayers obtains what she seeks and cannot be refused
7305797 also to illustrate and explain those matters which are contained only in an obscure way and implicitly in the deposit of faith
7305798 exalted to the heavenly throne above the choirs of angels
7305799 look upon the rainbow and bless him that made it surely it is beautiful in its brightness

7305857 con lo que se alentar a el consumo de productos chatarra en los ni os lesionando su salud
7305858 con base en un aparente rendimiento busquen m s recursos
7305859 pues consideramos que no ha fungido como nuestro representante al traicionar a la base trabajadora por no tomarla en cuenta para firmar la alianza
7305860 ha comenzado con la represi n para desestabilizar el movimiento
7305861 pese a que exist a una minuta con el compromiso nuestra comisi n no fue recibida vemos una total insensibilidad del gobernador tal parece que no le interesa la educaci n pero le recordamos que no somos pocos los que nos hemos movilizado
7305862 el profesor mexicano dej de ser maestro par ser ense ador
7305863 el poder de elba esther gordillo no deriva de cualidades como la inteligencia sino del dinero y los apoyos oficiales es una manifestaci n muy acentuada de la descomposici n del movimiento sindical mexicano
7305864 puede jugar todos los papeles menos el de ser formadora de la conciencia c vica y pol tica de las nuevas generaciones
7305865 pobre educaci n que no le dej a los alumnos otra inquietud que su porvenir personal
7305866 s lo una manifestaci n muy acentuada del estado de postraci n pol tica ideol gica y te rica que vive el pa s
7305867 es necesario convocar a una fuerza organizada aunque sea m nima para dar un grito de rebeld a y realizar un encuentro donde se analice el estado actual que viven las normales formadoras de maestros y buscar alternativas libres m s all de los espacios de control de gordillo morales y de josefina v zquez mota titular de la sep
7305868 la desaparici n de las normales es imposible pues hasta hoy son stas las escuelas con las cualidades para formar maestros no hay otras puede haber formaci n universitaria en la rama pedag gica pero no es lo mismo
7305869 las escuelas normales son uno de los puntales m s grandes con que deber a contar la educaci n nacional ya han desaparecido un n mero importante de normales rurales y esto puede continuar si no hay una fuerza que detenga la mentalidad reaccionaria de quienes dirigen la educaci n p blica en m xico y del propio gobierno federal
7305870 la escuela vistos los intereses de la revoluci n que la cre y los de ahora vemos que tiene una diferencia de kil metros la escuela p blica casi est ganada por los intereses del capital nacional y extranjero el profesor mexicano dej de ser maestro y est convertido en ense ador
7305871 hoy la situaci n ha llegado a niveles verdaderamente lamentables la conciencia de los maestros mexicanos est burocratizada su entrada a la escuela su salida su cheque quincenal eso es lo que importa lo dem s que vaya y venga como sea
7305872 en mi experiencia y formaci n como docente en las normales rurales y m s tarde en la benem rita escuela nacional de maestros me toc ver a mis profesores que eran gente que parec a ver los ltimos rel mpagos de la revoluci n y casi todos manten an un esp ritu de amor a m xico muy grande eso fue muy importante en mi formaci n
7305873 y en general tanto de gordillo como de v zquez mota y sus autoridades no pueden esperarse resultados diferentes en cuanto a la titular de la sep su formaci n no le da m s que para poner parches a los problemas del sistema educativo nacional en el caso de gordillo est endiosada con la cantidad de millones de pesos de que dispone el snte pero tambi n con el apoyo que recibe del alto mando gubernamental en todas las cosas que se mete mientras que el gremio con poco m s de un mill n 300 mil maestros es una fuerza num rica grande pero anulada por un bajo estado de conciencia y para hacerle frente al cacicazgo brutal que encabeza elba esther se requiere una disposici n de lucha con mucha firmeza
7305874 y la escuela se redujo de ser un instrumento de liberaci n social a uno en favor de los intereses del capital nacional y extranjero
7305875 ahora tenemos una escuela p blica que juega todos los papeles que se quiera menos el de la formaci n de la conciencia c vica y pol tica de la nueva generaci n de mexicanos
7305876 por eso debemos luchar por que las grandes banderas levantadas y por las cuales murieron millones de mexicanos se vuelvan a tomar y agitar p blicamente llamando al pueblo a que se haga consciente de los extremos brutales de debilidad ideol gica y pol tica al que lo han llevado los intereses del capital nacional y extranjero y es en la construcci n de este esfuerzo que los maestros tenemos grandes cosas por hacer
7305877 we think we can fill a void not only in faneuil hall but also in the boston comedy scene
7305878 mottley s comedy club will be a showcase club for the citys best comedians in an environment that encourages creativity sound lights and staging will be top notch and the quality of comedians and atmosphere will be a level above what youll find anywhere else in town
7305879 i love the boston comics but the day of boston people flocking to see local comedians has come and gone you cant squeeze blood out of a stone
7305880 luckily i have a great doctor and a great team or i might not have made it
7305881 as it was it was pretty tough in the race and i had a lot of pain but i dont think i lost time because of it
7305882 i think the spasms started when i woke up at around 5am yesterday saturday and they were so bad i was struggling to stand up
7305883 i had to have injections in my neck and i took some painkillers and i got through it but it was tough pedro was looking forward to racing i know that
7305884 i have had a miserable weekend really from the day i arrived i have a lot of flu symptoms a fever every day
7305885 i have had low energy just felt poorly with problems with the spasms in my neck which led to me being in doubt for the weekend and obviously for this race
7305886 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7305887 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7305888 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7305889 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7305890 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7305891 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7305892 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7305893 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7305894 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7305895 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7305896 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7305897 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7305898 such repressive measures will not work we will emerge stronger and more vibrant
7305899 the whole thing is truly compact it could be put in a cell phone and it can use just sunlight for illumination which makes it very appealing for third world applications
7305900 our research is motivated by the fact that microscopes have been around since the 16th century and yet their basic design has undergone very little change and has proven prohibitively expensive to miniaturize our new design operates on a different principle and allows us to do away with lenses and bulky optical elements
7305901 we could build hundreds or thousands of optofluidic microscopes onto a single chip which would allow many organisms to be imaged and analyzed at once
7305902 an implantable microscope analysis system can autonomously screen for and isolate rogue cancer cells in blood circulation thus providing important diagnostic information and helping arrest the spread of cancer

7305904 eine genossenschaft ist ein guter platz zum arbeiten aber entscheidungen dauern hier l nger als in anderen firmen

7305909 werden die pr fungen des mischverfahrens an den rohstoffen durchgef hrt welche die qualit t des produkts beeintr chtigen k nnen ein kleiner teil der dosierung liegt jedoch im verantwortungsbereich der mitarbeiter grund hierf r ist die absolute personalisierung der produkte auf dem markt in einigen f llen werden 10 000 kg waschmittel nur 15 g farbe beigemischt in quantitativer hinsicht stellt das einen geringf gigen anteil dar der f r die produktion aber unverzichtbar ist

7305911 among hundreds of italian companies producing ceramic tiles cooperativa ceramica dimola occupies a unique position its unceasing search for new ideas and capabilities has earned the company the long standing reputation as a leader in its field emphasizing the importance of research and technology while maintaining the highest possible standards of workmanship and design with three factories and fully automated production facilities cooperativa ceramica dimola is one of the five largest ceramic producers in italy with a range of products and activities that span the centuries and combine the disciplines of craftsmanship science architecture and fine art its origins were in a 15th century ceramics shop in the italian town of imola producing fine glazed traditional pottery over the many years the business grew into a small ceramic industry in an historic move giuseppe bucci the owner in 1874 transferred ownership of the company to its workers the result was italys first cooperative a company owned and managed by the people who worked there the philosophy of this utopian ideal led to the adoption of the companys symbol the industrious and cooperative bee in 1913 production was expanded to include wall tiles as well as pottery and in 1922 a former glassworks on imolas via veneto veneto street was purchased to become the companys first tile factory today the 33 000 square meter plant is still in operation producing double fired decorative tiles for interiors and exteriors these tiles have made the town of imola and cooperative ceramica dimola renowned throughout the world imola has continually updated its facilities to keep pace with production and technological evolution all of the factories are equipped with advanced machinery with completely automated pressing glazing seriographic color varnishing and firing together they produce millions of square meters of tiles each year which are shipped all over the world for cooperativa ceramica dimola styling is as important as the quality of raw materials used as well as quality of its end products the company has developed partnerships with artists designers and others who use ceramics as an instrument of creative expression in projects with the widest range of experimentation the fine glazed artistic pottery the companys first love is still considered with respect but imola has moved far beyond tradition to stand in the forefront of todays ceramic industry its present production combines sophisticated lines and materials with a business policy committed to the reinvestment of profits which has proven to be a winning combination imolas market area now reaches more than 75 countries around the world and with the support and cooperation of master distributors like bedrosians cooperativa ceramica dimola will play out its future development on a worldwide scal with its characteristic combination of originality and professionalism
7305912 today cooperativa ceramica dimola occupies a place at the summit of the industry in terms of technology and production standards as demonstrated by its export volumes which account for 75 of total sales cooperativa ceramica dimolas total production amounts to 16 million square meters per year it manufactures single fired double fired and fine porcelain stoneware tiles in a wide range of sizes as far as the production of fine porcelain stoneware tiles is concerned cooperativa ceramica dimola manufactures the largest tiles in the world imola engineering is the technical division of cooperativa ceramica dimola set up to help designers in the application of large slabs in fine porcelain stoneware the artistic workshop produces traditional and artistic ceramics revealing the companys commitment to artistic expression like any other story that of cooperativa ceramica dimola is based on important dates and events its origins date back to a 15th ceramic shop of fine glazed traditional pottery that developed into a ceramic industry with the passing of time in 1874 the small majolica and tableware factory known as fabbrica bucci was sold by the then owner giuseppe bucci to his workers who created the first form of cooperative enterprise in italy the use of the bee as a symbol indicating the virtues of hardwork and cooperation came about at a time when the workers considered the values of the community and solidarity as the basis for the future then came 1913 when production was enlarged a decision was taken to manufacture not only glazed traditional pottery and crockery but also wall tiles this quality leap demanded new space in a short amount of time so in 1922 the glassworks of via veneto were purchased by then the cooperative held a strong position had a central role in the development of imolas ceramic industry the war caused destruction but this was overcome by the will to reconstruct start again and update inorder not to lose out all the technical and productive developments this growth lead to a new production center set up in via correcchio in the 70s that was divided into three establishments for single fired and double fired tile production in the 80s cooperativa ceramica dimola purchased the borgo tossignano plant for the production of fine porcelain stoneware tiles the company was then able to offer its customers a complete range of ceramic products

7305914 die italienische genossenschaftsbewegung in italien haben genossenschaften eine lange tradition in der region emilia romagna konzentriert sich sogar die gr sste genossenschaftliche produktion der welt mitte der 80er jahre arbeiteten hier 50 der bev lkerung in einer kooperative im verlaufe der zeit haben sich die genossenschaften den jeweiligen bed rfnissen angepasst w hrend fr her die landwirtschaftliche kooperative mit mittelpunkt stand entstehen heute kooperativen wie gemeinschaftspraxen freier berufe neue dienstleistungsagenturen softwareh user freizeit bildungs und kultureinrichtungen eben so wie sich die genossenschaften den bed rfnissen der zeit angepasst haben wurde seit ende des 19 jahrhunderts die gesetzgebung permanent an die entwicklung angepasst aus der vielzahl der genossenschaften ist eine eigentliche kultur der kooperation erwachsen die heute dazu beitr gt dass die emilia romagna zu den wirtschaftlich erfolgreichsten regionen der welt geh rt diese kultur der kooperation zeigt auch ber die genossenschaftlich organisierte wirtschaft hinaus wirkung ein beispiel daf r die regionale wirtschaftsf rderung akquiriert auf dem markt der globalen wirtschaft auftr ge die keiner der betriebe in der region allein ausf hren k nnte um den auftrag ausf hren zu k nnen werden die verschiedenen teilarbeiten unter den betrieben der region aufgeteilt 80 der vereinbarungen die f r die kooperation n tig sind laufen per handschlag also auf blosse m ndliche absprache hin genossenschaften sind f r ganz italien von wirtschaftlicher bedeutung 1970 waren insgesamt 48 297 genossenschaften registriert 10 jahre sp ter bereits 84 183 ende 1990 z hlte das land gar 159 417 genossenschaftliche unternehmen in den vergangenen jahren konnten sich die genossenschaften vor allem auch in wirtschaftlichen bergangszonen im s den etablieren
7305915 die republik anerkennt die gesellschaftliche funktion der genossenschaft mit selbsthilfecharakter und ohne die zielsetzung des privaten gewinnstrebens das gesetz f rdert sie und beg nstigt ihr wachstum mit den daf r geeigneten mitteln und garantiert ihren charakter und ihre zielsetzungen durch entsprechende kontrollen
7305916 auf dem workshop soll der frage nachgegangen werden inwieweit genossenschaftliche ans tze alternativen zur privatisierung ffentlicher daseinsvorsorge bieten k nnen in den letzten jahren ist das interesse an genossenschaften gewachsen ilo und uno haben sich mehrfach intensiv mit der genossenschaftsproblematik befasst sie haben empfehlungen und programme diskutiert und verabschiedet die darauf zielen die potenzen von genossenschaften f r die l sung sozialer und globaler probleme zu erschlie en hunger unterentwicklung armut unterdr ckung und diskriminierung von frauen arbeitslosigkeit unw rdige arbeitsbedingungen und soziale ausgrenzung werden als herausforderungen genannt f r deren berwindung genossenschaften eine relevante rolle spielen k nnten staaten und regierungen wirtschaftspolitische zusammenschl sse arbeitgeber und gewerkschaften akteure der zivilgesellschaft werden aufgerufen ein gesellschaftliches klima zu schaffen das der gr ndung und entwicklung von genossenschaften f rderlich ist
7305917 wir w gen sorgf ltig ab zwischen dem schutz der genossenschaften und dem interesse der verbraucher an einem unverf lschten wettbewerb auf dem einzelhandelsmarkt steuererleichterungen f r kleine mutualistisch funktionierende genossenschaften und verg nstigungen die durch eine soziale zielsetzung im interesse der allgemeinheit gerechtfertigt sind wollen wir erhalten ungerechtfertigte steuerbefreiungen f r gro e genossenschaften jedoch die im direkten wettbewerb mit traditionellen handelsgesellschaften stehen unterbinden ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir in dieser sache rasch eine l sung finden wenn wir die gute zusammenarbeit mit den italienischen beh rden fortsetzen k nnen

7306260 i couldnt bring myself to do it i dont know i just wanted to know that he could know and be happy i didnt want his knowledge of our child to be tainted by that memory of his pain

7306268 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7306269 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7306270 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable

7306276 considering the cost as a percentage of entire military expenditure on an annual basis who wouldnt want a placebo or at best currently barely functional but potentially effective in the future missile defence system the goal doesnt have to be to thwart a russian missile armada even if the missile defense system deters a rogue nation like north korea from attacking it has paid for itself a thousand times over even if north korea does attack and manages to send three taepodong 2 icbms somewhere into our allies territory if our missile shield stops even one of those icbms we could be looking at several hundred thousands to millions of lives saved how can you say its a poor investment
7306277 what both of these camps overlook is that the sort of missile defenses that the united states might plausibly deploy would be valuable primarily in an offensive context not a defensive one as an adjunct to a u s first strike capability not as a standalone shield

7306327 as the flags are lowered over the 2008 olympic games china is basking in the achievement of a major objective an increase of its soft power not only in terms of gold medals won by chinese athletes but by the successful staging of the games china hopes to have advanced its prestige and attraction to other countries power is the ability to affect others to obtain the outcomes you want one can affect their behavior in three main ways threats of coercion sticks inducements or payments carrots and attraction that makes others want what you want a country may obtain the outcomes it wants in world politics because other countries want to follow it admiring its values emulating its example aspiring to its level of prosperity and openness soft power has now entered chinas official language in his keynote speech to the 17th national congress of the communist party of china cpc on october 15 2007 hu jintao stated that the cpc must enhance culture as part of the soft power of our country to better guarantee the peoples basic cultural rights and interests china has always had an attractive traditional culture but now it is entering the realm of global popular culture as well yao ming the chinese star of the national basketball associations houston rockets could become another michael jordan and while china lost to the u s in basketball yao was one of the stars of the beijing olympics the enrollment of foreign students in china has tripled from 36 000 to 110 000 over the past decade and the number of foreign tourists has also increased dramatically to 17 million per year even before the olympics in addition china has created some 200 confucius institutes around the world to teach its language and culture and while the voice of americas was cutting its chinese broadcasts from 19 to 14 hours a day china radio international was increasing its broadcasts in english to 24 hours a day but just as chinas economic and military power does not yet match that of the united states chinas soft power still has a long way to go china does not have cultural industries like hollywood and its universities are not yet the equal of americas it lacks the many non governmental organizations that generate much of americas soft power politically china suffers from corruption inequality and a lack of democracy human rights and the rule of law while that may make beijing attractive in authoritarian and semi authoritarian developing countries it undercuts chinas soft power in the west given the domestic problems that china must still overcome there are limits to chinas ability to attract others but one would be foolish to ignore the gains it is making the beijing olympics were an important part of chinas strategy to increase its soft power
7306328 politically china suffers from corruption inequality and a lack of democracy human rights and the rule of law

7306426 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7306427 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7306428 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy

7306438 i dont want to pre empt it but we do know that its not getting any cheaper to participate in the olympics if you fund at the same level you move backwards
7306439 we have got the formula right but lets look at how it can be honed even further
7306440 of course people are hurting because of change in the economy but i think this is an appropriate spend its not just about medals its about encouraging participation that leads to better health and tackling obesity
7306441 if we stay still we will get further behind in our review we have to look for another edge
7306442 there was a very small number of painted vehicles and we understand quite a few of them went through to queenstown for skiing
7306443 its quite clear that it the undie 500 is seen as a magnet

7306446 we had done all we could to distance ourselves from this years trip
7306447 there is no doubt the combined efforts of all these agencies resulted in reduced overall levels of disorder
7306448 in the end we remain dependent upon the responsibility of individuals involved
7306449 ultimately it came down to recognising caroline and georginas extraordinary performance at beijing but also taking into account their performance in athens

7306451 air new zealand is in a strong financial position has completed its fleet upgrade and has the leading product on all of its key routes
7306452 we are likely to see rising costs slowing traffic and increased competition in the coming months
7306453 couple this with hedging benefits rolling off potential for a higher us dollar and slowing traffic 2009 and 2010 could be two very hard years for air new zealand
7306454 this is the best of times and the worst of times and i am just trying to delve into both those emotions
7306455 my heart aches for my wife and my family but at the same time i am immensely proud of what my team has achieved
7306456 on that final moment it dawned on me what had happened so i grabbed my staff who have been so instrumental in this
7306457 its been going in wellington for about 18 months we are hoping it can run every six months here
7306458 i think we got about 3000 people through over four hours
7306459 it was pretty packed there was a really good atmosphere and people seemed really excited about the whole idea the only slight criticism was that people wished it had gone on for longer

7306464 certain fish stocks are in trouble but because there isnt enough scientific evidence available i cant lower the quota getting it would be hard and prohibitively expensive in some cases in the case of orange roughy it might not be possible to get the required information until the species was gone
7306465 without the right information the law requires he must go for maximum sustainable yield and that is totally biased to the commercial side
7306466 there are a range of other valid internationally accepted stock assessment approaches that can be used the bill allows those approaches to be used to legally justify catch reductions
7306467 the select committee has allowed for all groups to have their say
7306468 and an ideological war it is our country and we will defend it
7306469 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taleban definitely have the upper hand
7306470 the issue which is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it
7306471 n o h decep o isso s haveria se a gente tivesse vindo e aqui e n o tivesse lutado a talvez eu daria uma resposta diferente desta mas jogamos com o cora o
7306472 when we compared the official policy statements and voting records of the two contenders for the white house we identified an obvious choice for farm families and rural america
7306473 we have closely studied the on line agricultural and rural policy statements of the two candidates and their voting records following a meeting with the obama campaign at our board conference in omaha last week the decision was clear to us acga endorses and supports the election of senator obama for president of the united states
7306474 at this time of great opportunity to rebuild not only rural america but all america through an aggressive national commitment to renewable energy of all kinds the voting record and policy statements of senator obama and senator mccain indicate very contrasting differences
7306475 senator obama also supported the recently passed food conservation and energy act of 2008 or as it is commonly called the farm bill
7306476 farmers and rural voters understand the importance of farm bills these packages not only address agriculture and farms but cover the full dynamic scope of issues vital to rural america conservation trade rural development research nutrition rural credit and more in fact the new farm bill spends over 80 percent of its resources on non farm programs and rightfully does not even have farm in its title
7306477 i can say unequivocally as an illinois farmer that senator obama has exactly the same amount of experience in terms of time served in the illinois legislature and in the u s congress as another illinois lawyer who was elected president just as the nation was coming apart at the seams abraham lincoln senator obama is ready to lead america and the american corn growers wholeheartedly endorse him for president of the united states of america
7306478 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7306479 i think the usoc and the chinese olympic organizing committee both have has done a wonderful job of making this seem like home
7306480 everyone in china has been so accommodating and helpful and i can honestly say that when you dream about the olympic experience what came to fruition here in china is what you dream about
7306481 the company feels it is time for a change to give the british public a time keeping service that is current modern and useful
7306482 even if we do not win medals in these competitions our athletes need foreign exposure in order to know their level in the international arena
7306483 talent identity should start very early and those chosen must have the commitment to train long eight to 12 years to win a medal in the olympics

7306529 i am often asked if the olympic village the vast restaurant and housing conglomeration that hosts the worlds top athletes for the duration of the games is the sex fest it is cracked up to be
7306530 my answer is always the same too right it is
7306531 are the principal objects of desire for many female athletes there is something about sporting success that makes a certain type of woman go crazy smiling flirting and sometimes even grabbing at the chaps who have done the business in the pool or on the track an olympic gold medal is not merely a route to fame and fortune it is also a surefire ticket to writhe
7306532 and then there were the female athletes literally thousands of them
7306533 strutting shimmying sashaying and jogging around the village clad in lycra and exposing yard upon yard of shiny toned rippling and unimaginably exotic flesh

7306554 every day in the gulf coast league youre liable to see something youve never seen before
7306555 others including the international olympic committee arrange their rankings by gold medals won
7306556 nobody in his right mind would claim that a country winning 15 silver medals should be ranked lower than a country winning a single gold medal
7306557 would rather live in the united states as a loser than in china as a winner
7306558 while many of taiwan s people are chinese migr s from the mainland or descendants of migr s the people native to the island are taiwanese
7306559 im better than you because the country i happen to be born in had other people born in who ive never met interacted with or seen other than in the newspaper or on the internet once or twice happen to have done a little better in an international sporting event than someone in your country
7306560 see the games as between athletes not countries nonetheless placed list countries in a order based on gold number too the ranking system used by most us media outlets to me is an unnecesary show of lack of confidence
7306561 the times is doing a much better job than 99 of the american media
7306562 taiwan an island which china regards as a breakaway province
7306563 the national media of all the countries who compete at these games display the medal table accordingly with the exception of the us
7306564 i do not know why non americans are so concerned about how the american media report the olympics to their own people
7306565 the us is probably the only country that refuses to get rid of english units of measurement
7306566 hurray we won 4 gold 3 siler and 7 bronze today in beijing it is going to be one of the many olympics that usa participated and achieved scores comparable to the top 5 nations blah blah blah
7306567 mens shooting 50m free rifle 3 positions 3 40 shots
7306568 but what if i won x and you won y
7306569 for the first time in our tabulation the united states has passed china in gold medals the chinese have a staggering 23 golds in judged events exactly half of their regular total the united states has just four golds in such sports in total china has earned 35 medals in sports with judges while the u s has 19
7306570 michael phelps plus 4 away from the us is he going next time
7306571 hahaha everything is always easy for america us can add 110m 120m 130m 390m 400m into swimming competitions then us will get 200 gold medals at least
7306572 at the times we have no interest in which country tops the list
7306573 it is funny when phelps got 6 golds and 2 silvers in 2004 nobody said he broke mark spitz s record then why not if you go with the ap way
7306574 it speaks more to true american values in saying that we americans rarely remember who lost the super bowl or the world series or the nba championship
7306575 it s hard to understand how this issue would even matter to the highest gold medal earners the chinese since they don t even have access to the foreign press
7306576 i cant quite fathom the pathological need of americans to feel 1 in everything even if they are not
7306577 the american track amp field team continues to lay a giant egg in the birds nest
7306578 as of 2007 the u s customary units remain the last widely used official non metric system of measurement as besides the united states only liberia and myanmar have not adopted the international system of units as their primary or sole system of measurement
7306579 the ioc does not have promote medal rankings so please quit talking about an official ioc ranking its against their charter to have such a thing
7306580 lets just enjoy the amazing performances from people all over the world
7306581 these olympics are between the u s and china and no other country is even in the running
7306582 first of all for all of the anti american posters just face the fact that these olympics are between the u s and china and no other country is even in the running many of the comments sound like sour grapes from people whose countries cannot compete with the best
7306583 i mean china rules table tennis but does anyone really care
7306584 why can t the media just be gracious and just congratulate china on doing a good job too the point of the games is still promote world peace and whatever happened to sportsmanship usa is a great country and people should not be so insecure that china did well it s good for the world all china wants is to bring back a sense of pride in the people and country every person around the world would want that let s just enjoy the amazing performances from people all over the world ditto
7306585 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7306586 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective has demonstrated is a winning combination
7306587 like care for working families and the poor and foreign policy premised on peace over war
7306588 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7306589 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7306590 separate themselves from communion with the church and should not present themselves for the eucharist
7306591 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7306592 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7306593 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7306594 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7306595 a going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7306596 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7306597 luckily i have a great doctor and a great team or i might not have made it
7306598 as it was it was pretty tough in the race and i had a lot of pain but i dont think i lost time because of it
7306599 i think the spasms started when i woke up at around 5am yesterday saturday and they were so bad i was struggling to stand up
7306600 i had to have injections in my neck and i took some painkillers and i got through it but it was tough pedro was looking forward to racing i know that
7306601 i have had a miserable weekend really from the day i arrived i have a lot of flu symptoms a fever every day
7306602 i have had low energy just felt poorly with problems with the spasms in my neck which led to me being in doubt for the weekend and obviously for this race
7306603 i really wish these 16 days could start all over again
7306604 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7306605 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7306606 the chinese people teeming with enthusiasm have honored the commitments they solemnly made
7306607 you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport
7306608 the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitors from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7306609 for 16 days and 16 nights we basked in the happiness and pride of the olympiad chinas fulfillment of its centennial dream coincides with the world
7306610 i bet you met many musicians to record there eh
7306611 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7306612 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
7306613 include that drilling let it compete and see where we come down on it and if that in fact is a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7306614 o psd recusa pactuar com a tentativa enganosa do primeiro ministro
7306615 diane worked with such compassion and integrity thats always been her skill
7306616 we look at disadvantaged residents of the keys towns and bring citizens together to express what they need
7306617 what if you have money but you have a disability the wealthy can be disadvantaged what if you are a wealthy woman but you have post partum depression what if toxins disadvantage you
7306618 we look at any keys resident struggling with a problem that has a community component and needs a community response not a portland answer not a portsmouth answer but an answer for the keys region
7306619 diane told us to not only look at the need but look at what the assets are we in the social services have a history of looking at need but diane said look at the assets because we have a lot of them
7306620 im not only talking about corporate entities who might make donations but people resources who are the people what are the assets of youth or our seniors or other targeted populations that we might not think to ask
7306621 raising children cooking getting everyone where they have to go is hard enough but what if she doesnt have a car what if shes being abused
7306622 we conducted long interviews and i learned how to listen how to see things from different sides and isnt that the basis of peace and not war seeing things from various perspectives
7306623 a lot of students dont want to be part of the drunk frat scene but dont know what else to do at orientation we told them if youre not attracted to the drinking scene we have an option for you
7306624 the feds were happy with it which kind of surprised me
7306625 i told them im not a medical person im not a hospital person
7306626 they said were hiring you to work in the community
7306627 unfortunately the area is seen as not maine and not new hampshire theres always been this split certain things were fully available for southern york county but a lot was not
7306628 in order to do what we were proposing there had to be a lot of facilitating a lot of communication we had to have people buy in and thats where she had strength
7306629 of all the things ive done in my life what we accomplished then was one of the more powerful examples of people who want to make a change creating a safe process to move improvements forward
7306630 and diane was at the center of it she was the glue that kept us all together we lived in fear of her leaving
7306631 the funding environment is less friendly right now for more creative holistic community based generalists like me
7306632 now you have to be specific if youre working organic matter into the garden and it helps everything in the garden thats a generalist if youre dealing with one crop and showing measurable improvements in the one crop you planted thats whats getting funding right now
7306633 ill be 63 in september for the last couple of years i was getting tired theres a physical and mental and emotional level that declines for most of us
7306634 im still intelligent and im still capable but having deadline deadline deadline made me ill its time to slow down
7306635 today people understand the concept of working together in a very real way because of diane
7306636 the fact is were much better off if we find common ground instead of looking for differences and she was very much a champion of common ground
7306637 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
7306638 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
7306639 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
7306640 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
7306641 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
7306642 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
7306643 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
7306644 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
7306645 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
7306646 we really want to get the message out to people
7306647 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
7306648 im not sure the reason i feel bad because wyland does fabulous work but my hands are tied
7306649 the fund raising process actually sounds like its going to be a lot of fun because it sounds like theres a ton of support in the community
7306650 the committee continues to move forward as best we can but until we get that element worked out it will be difficult

7306655 within juarez there has been mounting violence between the drug cartel and the police and the murder rate as chronicled in the media has soared
7306656 so much that 35 volunteer groups planning on building in juarez cancelled their trip it put a real strain on casa por cristo we decided not to cancel we persevered the authorities had taken measures to limit travel in the city
7306657 there was a grandfather armando the father jaime cuenca de la parra the mother who was pregnant with her third child rosa elvira larreta frias and two children alejandro and emanuel
7306658 one child was in the hospital with respiratory problems it was vital that they receive that home
7306659 our church has set up an endowment to assure money for future years
7306660 one thing that strikes me is that we built this house in four days and no one got hurt no one got sick
7306661 there were a few small dings but everyone looked out for each other the two groups became one id hear people say you look hot go sit down theyd ask if others were drinking enough water because it was so hot
7306662 when we arrived we saw a lot of casa houses
7306663 basically the technology is here its just a matter of engineering it for the lowest cost the highest reliability and the longest survivability in a hostile and corrosive environment

7306698 ahora nos vamos perdiendo pero dejando la imagen de lo que somos un equipo nico muy especial y que quiere ganar contra quien sea
7306699 hay que mirar cada partido como una batalla distinta ste dice mucho de nosotros y de lo merecedores que somos de estar aqu pero no puedo decir que una derrota sea el mejor encuentro de esta selecci n
7306700 ellos han tenido que dar m s del cien por cien cerca del 200 por cien porque si no no ganan

7306706 the occupation failed at killing the palestinian cause and the evidence is you
7306707 it is time the international community helped ease israel out from its fantasy world where stone and concrete equals right and justice
7306708 it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me and i think thats pretty important
7306709 the horrors of the second world war gave impetus to a quest for universal peace justice and human dignity with the united nations at the fore it is a disturbing commentary on our quest that as we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights palestinians mark six decades of what they refer to as the nakba or catastrophe with many languishing in conditions of exile exclusion and isolation this is a testament to our collective failure to give meaning to human dignity for palestinians and to achieve a lasting just peace in the middle east we who serve palestine refugees believe that there is time to make amends exile for sixty years palestine refugees have been in exile from their ancestral lands nowhere is this more starkly visible than in the west bank where the illegal barrier hundreds of checkpoints and physical obstructions daily reinforce the exile and in gaza the policies of closure and indiscriminate punishment devastate lives causing mass despair threatening to destroy hopes for peace exclusion palestine refugees also face exclusion from the justice afforded by international law the aim of which is to offer the protection security and dignity taken for granted in a world where respect for human rights and the rule of law have become guiding principles of global governance embodied in the canons of international law are clear prohibitions against systematic attacks against civilian populations against deliberately depriving civilians of food against the intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure and against the transfer of an occupying powers population onto the land it occupies the violations of these and other provisions serve to underscore among palestinians a sense of exclusion from the protection of the international system
7306710 everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration without distinction of any kind such as race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national or social origin property birth or other status
7306711 i assure you al awda is greatly appreciated at least we feel not abandoned and your work has certainly made a dent in spreading the truth around keep up the good work

7306714 no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country
7306715 the legality of the peoples struggle for self determination and liberation
7306716 it would be an offence against the principles of elemental justice if these innocent victims of the conflict were denied the right to return to their homes while jewish immigrants flow into palestine
7306717 the palestinian refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which under principles of international law or in equity should be made good by the governments or authorities responsible

7306721 nous ne disposons pas pour le moment dinformations sur le nombre de victimes
7306722 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7306723 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
7306724 include that drilling let it compete and see where we come down on it and if that in fact is a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7306725 f or many years now decades i have been silent as a jew about israels relationship to and treatment of the palestinian people and my place as an american jew in that equation
7306726 more than 1 5 billion in private u s funds go to israel annually
7306727 i just heard a report on national public radio those monsters are going to allow al jazeera to be broadcast in vermont i cant believe theyll allow that propaganda on the radio
7306728 dont you think that building a wall is somewhat reminiscent of the wall constructed around the warsaw ghetto during world war ii
7306729 i cant believe that a jew would say such a thing are you a maniac do you want to harm israel
7306730 t he lorry drivers who bring the pepsi and petrol for nato troops in kabul have their own way of calculating the talebans progress towards the afghan capital they simply count the lorries destroyed on the main roads
7306731 they just missed me but hit the two trucks behind
7306732 this road used to be safe but in the last month theyve been attacking more and more
7306733 if the afghan army isnt there a fly cannot pass
7306734 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7306735 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
7306736 the senator has even brought his military record into discussion of his music tastes explaining that his favorite song was dancing queen by abba he offered that his knowledge of music stopped evolving when his plane intercepted a surface to air missile dancing queen however was produced in 1975 eight years after mccains plane was shot down
7306737 certain fish stocks are in trouble but because there isnt enough scientific evidence available i cant lower the quota getting it would be hard and prohibitively expensive in some cases in the case of orange roughy it might not be possible to get the required information until the species was gone
7306738 without the right information the law requires he must go for maximum sustainable yield and that is totally biased to the commercial side
7306739 there are a range of other valid internationally accepted stock assessment approaches that can be used the bill allows those approaches to be used to legally justify catch reductions
7306740 the select committee has allowed for all groups to have their say
7306741 it is all about outlook statements where you are hedged at in the future and where oil is going to end up
7306742 we are likely to see rising costs slowing traffic and increased competition in the coming months
7306743 couple this with hedging benefits rolling off potential for a higher us dollar and slowing traffic 2009 and 2010 could be two very hard years for air new zealand
7306744 mr krukziener has not satisfied me that he has a counter claim set off or cross demand equal to or in excess of the summary judgment sum
7306745 he has not raised any other reason to impugn debt and i do not find any other circumstances which either cause the issue of the bankruptcy notice or continuation of bankruptcy proceedings based on it to be an abuse of process warranting exercise of the courts inherent jurisdiction to set aside or stay
7306746 they wanted something contemporary to house their new range of action films
7306747 were more about the idea but usually at the end we do have technology gluing it together and its generally mobile or the web

7306755 berry has given a very simple silhouette a rather complex appearance though the use of various types of graphics colours and materials each pair of kicks draws upon classic imagery from their assigned city for instance los angeles features a cool blue colorway whilst the uppers are littered with paisley print and graphics of palm trees and low rider bikes new york is represented by berrys reinterpretation of the citys subway system and notoriety for graffiti whilst mexico citys most obvious inspiration comes from the colours of the national flag turning back the clocks london finds itself in medieval history while moscow uses imagery from the soviet era the tokyo themed sneakers feature nice details but will not see a release in these parts due to the usage of graphics depicting the japanese army during wartime which could cause sensitivity issues

7306757 its such a huge country theres no point turning up in mumbai if you find out your best partners might be in jaipur or bagasra
7306758 if you are looking at normal developed economies you can find most things on the internet but not in india its not very well documented and the information is not widely available so you really have to come here to scope out the opportunities and find out who the partners are
7306759 once youre actually here its pretty straightforward its not a country that in my view is overly complex once you have found the right people and thats always an issue in any market finding the right people to work with
7306760 the opportunities are great at the moment especially with technology products or anything that is a niche product that might be able to be mass produced here in india
7306761 what we offer is a level of access that they might not otherwise be able to gain
7306762 even those who have done a certain amount of homework and spent some time sussing out the market still havent always hit the right combination of partnering with local resources
7306763 those who come here and who have done their homework know what theyre up against the infrastructure is what it is you have a number of permissions to get if youre setting up shop here if youre setting up a branch office or whatever then somebody has got to do their homework and when youre prepared for what is required to be done then its just a process
7306764 from start up to profitability id say between 18 months and two years
7306765 but you ought to be able to turn cash positive before that if you have done it the right way going the joint venture route or finding a local partner or just accessing the right types of training programmes or using the headhunters of infrastructure support services
7306766 thats where companies will do it in an increasingly better way so they get off the mark sooner and our job as mentors is basically to help them towards that
7306767 i know there are some fine new zealand wines wed like to quaff by the bottle too but otherwise awareness is low
7306768 some of the greatest potential in india is in sectors like agriculture household waste management energy efficient lighting or anything energy efficient because theres such a lack of electrification in many parts that if you can have something that minimises waste of energy it can help a lot

7306772 the meaninglessness of life in working class america takes its painful toll in loneliness and alienation that is bad enough in itself but the worst kind of people among us the very people and class that profit from misery and ignorance are always right there to direct the anger that ultimately must arise from the frustrating emptiness and fear that has become our national atmosphere mr adkisson may have been religiously obsessed but he was also an out of work truck driver nearing 60 and about to lose his food stamps we can blame mr adkisson we can blame the rush limbaughs and anne coulters for publicly advocating just this sort of action and making millions in the process but ultimately we must ask just what sort of society produces school shootings and the kind of violence we have just seen in my native tennessee when we honestly examine that question we will discover that we are active ingredients in that society one which has allowed faceless millions to decline into ignorance fear and despair and tolerated the hate speech of those who incite these damaged souls to violence for their own political or financial gain we all have a moral choice to make we can become more hateful each of us in our own political camp or we can forgive mr adkisson and make open personal resistance each in his or her own way against those who manage our society to such desperate ends or we can continue to be divided by those in whose best interests it is to see us hate one another politically or religiously i think the unitarians leadership and that of the local fundamentalist congregations should meet pray and break bread together regularly for all are believers in a peaceful and meaning filled life of purpose regardless of creed or even lack of creed the truth is that such a group sharing fellowship in the flesh cannot be falsely mislead by distant demagogues
7306773 how valuable an asset can experience be in a culture where knowledge wisdom and history are frowned upon
7306774 his very presence the color of his skin the very strangeness of his name is the best guarantee of his betrayal of the expectations of the constituencies that will vote to elect him
7306775 the truth violates the primary narrative that our elite use to justify their legitimacy which is the supposed meritocratic nature of american society

7306790 senator obama saying the question of when does a life begins is above his paygrade whether you are looking at it scientifically or theologically if he were to come to you and say help me out here madam speaker when does life begin what would you tell him
7306791 i would say that as an ardent and practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7306792 the catholic church at the moment feel very strongly that it begins at the moment of conception
7306793 his very presence the color of his skin the very strangeness of his name is the best guarantee of his betrayal of the expectations of the constituencies that will vote to elect him barack obama is in short order a far more reassuring prospect for the continued dominance of the financial elite than another four years of neo conservative rule which in an almost historically unique combination of greed ill will incompetence and stupidity have brought the country to the edge of disaster
7306794 i owe no man anything and no man owes me i am free unto myself
7306795 except for one transposition of quotes i have never milked a cow in my life and certainly never walked four miles to school that was 80 year old jim mccoys quote
7306796 the countries on the globe are not marked out in different colors because the soil is different in those places its marked off in colors because different mobsters control different areas of turf on the planet
7306797 they are stabilising things with some advice from geo technical advisers
7306798 at this stage weve got no significant issues within the highway other than possible effects to the services like gas and water
7306799 we have stringent requirements in terms of any destabilising of the highway
7306800 during the consent process of any proposed development we have to be satisfied that everything has been done and designed in an appropriate manner
7306801 people are much less likely to let their dogs poop on the lawns of people they know it is about social responsibility
7306802 the first games to compete in would be very overwhelming so being there now to see the hype means we wont be overwhelmed later and we can focus on the events
7306803 i made some good results in my first year competing in slalom in the 2005 fis federation internationale de ski races and when i went to alberta i started making some good results in grand slalom
7306804 i came first in the albert cup series race and the gs open womens and other podium finishes
7306805 im stronger than ive ever been and ive put on more body mass which was my aim so im more solid and flexible
7306806 i do hate not being able to ski especially on days like this but im skiing in my mind im always thinking about it and im still around my team and watching the world cup which is my long term goal
7306807 to be a world cup skier youve got to be pretty good competition is really strict in europe i want to be a top contender and i dont like going into races unprepared
7306808 my long term goal is to be the best in the world however long it takes well get there
7306809 certain fish stocks are in trouble but because there isnt enough scientific evidence available i cant lower the quota getting it would be hard and prohibitively expensive in some cases in the case of orange roughy it might not be possible to get the required information until the species was gone
7306810 without the right information the law requires he must go for maximum sustainable yield and that is totally biased to the commercial side
7306811 there are a range of other valid internationally accepted stock assessment approaches that can be used the bill allows those approaches to be used to legally justify catch reductions
7306812 the select committee has allowed for all groups to have their say
7306813 i think this is an event that we dont want to happen because it fuels things it proves to me all it is is a booze trip
7306814 there is no doubt the combined efforts of all these agencies resulted in reduced overall levels of disorder during the weekend however there is still a lot to be addressed in the end we remain dependent upon the responsibility of individuals involved to make good decisions
7306815 there were half the number of arrests and three times the number of police
7306816 you cant judge 20 000 students based on the actions of 12 who were arrested
7306817 i dont know that we can blame canterbury students for this one we may have to look at otago students this time
7306818 we thought the situation was under control the day had gone quietly it was pretty low key everyone was well behaved this the disorder that followed was definitely unexpected
7306819 ordinarily during times of high wholesale prices contact performs well as the gas fired generation more than compensates for the drop in hydro generation this year contact has been receiving significantly less for its gas generation compared to what it has had to pay to cover south island demand
7306820 if that was translated into a lot less money than youre currently burning just sitting going nowhere most new zealanders will go with it
7306821 if you go out to the public and say would you like to pay more no one is going to say yes to that its a ridiculous type of question
7306822 you have to consult with the right questions saying paying tolls will mean major reductions in fuel and time
7306823 other countries have more realistic time frames in the order of 50 and 60 years to get a reasonable return on your investment
7306824 to take all the windfall gains and basically socialise all the losses
7306825 now victoria new south wales and even queensland let the costs fall where they lie telling the private sector there is no guarantee well bail you out where things go wrong
7306826 we feel we can work our way through it we have sufficient capital to pay debentures as they come through
7306827 this is my first audio review sorry if i am a little bland this is mostly a test and just to see if this works razz a few things i would like to clear up is that its goemons great adventure not just ganbare goemon im just used to calling it that when in reality its the name of the series razz so yea other then that every time i say ganbare goemon its actually goemons great adventure so yea other then that hope you like it feedback much appreciated
7306828 existing policy and any legislative requirements will be dealt with first
7306829 we are starting to get more questions about it but the catch is there is always a trade off
7306830 just put me in a cardboard box and send me off
7306831 although it is nice to think of the natural approach and letting things go back into the environment that does not account for the fact we are human beings and we have got to grieve
7306832 its significant because its not a tourism award and its focused on an issue thats on the forefront of everyones mind
7306833 even if you dont win you still come out as a winner because of the amount of time and effort the judges spend on your submission
7306834 they gave suggestions on how we could improve and were already studying them
7306835 attention to detail reliability good branding hard work and fabulous places
7306836 were driven by trying to have as little impact on the environment given what we do
7306837 theres been a lot of people saying its all about fairytales its not actually coming to watch a fairytale at all
7306838 hes used the classic characters to say watch out for what you wish for wishes can come true and when they do is it what you really wanted in the first place happily ever after but at what cost
7306839 its very humorous but its very moving its about loss tragedies happen great things happen theres infidelity marriage and it all happens in the woods
7306840 its a big broadway production but were doing it in a very intimate way
7306841 we love using the arrowtown hall its just a nice community out there
7306842 the good value productions brand as it were is now out there
7306843 i think people remember hair in the queenstown gardens and cabaret and flagons and foxtrots and they know what they can expect from us
7306844 but do tell me my dear man who are your clients
7306845 now when obama was nominated in denver of colorado in the days of w the satan behold there came desperate dems from the 57 states to denver saying where is he that is born king of the dems for we have seen his star in the msm and are come to suck up to him
7306846 it is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood
7306847 lines written after hearing w s merwin read a poem about his last conversation with his father
7306848 it was a very high level of competition it was a significant step up from the level of questioning at regional level the girls handled it extremely well
7306849 tim and i have travelled together for years and weve never had a sincere conversation a triumph for male relationships

7306852 i dont want to pre empt it but we do know that its not getting any cheaper to participate in the olympics if you fund at the same level you move backwards
7306853 we cant let up on the momentum we have gained we have got the formula right but lets look at how it can be honed even further
7306854 absolutely of course people are hurting because of change in the economy but i think this is an appropriate spend its not just about medals its about encouraging participation that leads to better health and tackling obesity
7306855 there was a very small number of painted vehicles and we understand quite a few of them went through to queenstown for skiing
7306856 its quite clear that it the undie 500 is seen as a magnet
7306857 its much improved on last year our belief has been student behaviour is improving but its still far from acceptable
7306858 its a booze trip it does have something to do with it
7306859 we had done all we could to distance ourselves from this years trip
7306860 there is no doubt the combined efforts of all these agencies resulted in reduced overall levels of disorder
7306861 in the end we remain dependent upon the responsibility of individuals involved
7306862 all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others
7306863 of course the media are free to go to tibet
7306864 but as you know due to the recent riots that are happening in tibet there is a limitation not only for the media but also for the general public to go to tibet so i think maybe you need approval but in general the media in the past and the present and the future are free to go to tibet
7306865 the ioc would have liked to have seen the protest zones genuinely being used but its not an area that falls within our direct remit

7306869 you walk up to it and motion sensors trigger water to spray out in a mist and run down the wall it is atomised water so if they did get paint on the wall it is very easy to remove in the morning
7306870 all the walls we have in place are just never tagged they have a go once and they get water sprayed on them so they do not come back
7306871 were very pleased about that i have a personal concern about having to turn people away after the first of september in a truth and reconciliation process we dont want to turn people away
7306872 this is the pathway to change from grievance mode to growth mode
7306873 its fine for the crown who have the resources to do the research
7306874 were saying to everybody just get something in worry about the detail after we even went to the point of telling people write them down on table napkins just to get them in
7306875 it was interesting when we screened the film for some of the parents and the kids
7306876 the parents were really moved they had no idea the kids were thinking those thoughts it just goes to show that if you take the time and pay attention and if youre quiet enough you hear things
7306877 the scum were to be squished we were in afghanistan to kill the taliban it was a matter of our survival if we werent there theyd be here arguably they could be here because we are there no but such common sense questions are not permitted these days
7306878 the military is best used as a threat once you use it theres not much else the united states has lost the ability to influence events
7306879 rather than strengthening the british interest it proved to be the beginning of the decline of the british empire it barely won the first world war at a ghastly cost by the end of the second world war it was in hock to the u s and its empire was gone

7306888 its sad to see flair advertised for some low rent wrestling shows at this stage of his life
7306889 he should really be above that i dont know what his take will be in 12 months but unless its significantly above the half million dollars he was making from vince mcmahon i just dont understand what hes trying to accomplish
7306890 im not saying flair shouldnt take advantage of his earning potential right now and i hope he makes millions in whatever he does but seeing him in these ads for every rinky dink out there just makes him look ancient instead of being relevant which he still can be
7306891 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7306892 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region

7306960 we have to say without ambiguity or hesitation that capitalism historically realized deserves only the calm condemnation of christian consciousness is it necessary to justify this it will be enough to recall here some of the alienations of human nature characteristic of the concrete capitalist situation reduction of human labor to the condition of a commodity dictatorship of private property not subordinated to the demands of the common good abuses of economic power unbridled competition on one side and monopolistic practices of all kinds on the other central motivation as the pursuit of profit the humanity of the worker cannot remain in brazilian society submissive to the tyranny of money and of cruel competition in short to the mechanism of capitalism
7306961 the christian quest for justice is a demand arising from biblical teaching all men are merely humble stewards of material goods in the search for salvation we must avoid the dualism which separates temporal tasks from the work of sanctification although we are encompassed with imperfections we are men of hope we have faith that our love for christ and our brethren will not only be the great force liberating us from injustice and oppression but also the inspiration for social justice understood as a whole of life and as an impulse toward the integral growth of our countries
7306962 liberation a human phenomenon cannot be achieved by semihumans the conviction of the oppressed that they must fight for their liberation is not a gift bestowed by the revolutionary leadership but the result of their own conscientizacao it is essential for the oppressed to realize that when they accept the struggle for humanization they also accept from that moment their total responsibility for the struggle they must realize that they are fighting not merely for freedom from hunger but for freedom to create and to construct to wonder and to venture such freedom requires that the individual be active and responsible not a slave or a well fed cog in the machine it is not enough that men are not slaves if social conditions further the existence of automatons the result will not be love of life but love of death

7306984 stanco per le olimpiadi sono pronto a ricominciare con il napoli
7306985 mi hanno aiutato tutti adesso sono vicino al pieno recupero
7306986 io mi sento bene e la gamba risponde in maniera positiva sto lavorando molto e non mi sono mai praticamente fermato in tutto il lungo periodo estivo di riabilitazione vediamo coma va nella prossima settimana abbiamo due impegni importanti e spero di poter essere a disposizione
7306987 eh s lo ricordo bene magari potessi ripetermi ma per me adesso lobiettivo principale quello di ristabilirmi e tornare al massimo della mia condizione
7306988 sotto questo profilo devo ringraziare tante persone innanzitutto il dottore che mi ha operato e tutto lo staff medico del napoli poi la societ che mi stata sempre vicina la squadra ed i tifosi che mi hanno regalato tanto affetto mi hanno fatto sentire un giocatore importante e questo fondamentale quando si lontani dal campo e bisogna affrontare con fiducia un lavoro di recupero
7306989 personalmente vorrei fare pi gol dello scorso anno e poi soprattutto mi auguro che il ginocchio stia bene definitivamente
7306990 stanco per le olimpiadi sono pronto a ricominciare con il napoli
7306991 you saw what would have happened last year and what would happen this year if we tried to be one dimensional we have to go back to the same way we were before
7306992 we lost two significant parts of what our offense hoped to be
7306993 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7306994 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7306995 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7306996 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7306997 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7306998 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
7306999 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7307000 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7307001 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7307002 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
7307003 note that fidelity personal retirement annuity doesnt have a guaranteed minimum death benefit whereas the industry average annuity may

7307016 theres only about 90 megs of water in that were working out how to get it from point a to point b
7307017 all i can say is that weve taken steps to put drinking water in place which should have been done years ago
7307018 i would say there probably are some people drinking it if they are i hope theyre looking after their health
7307019 weve always struggled with water but its never been as bad as this
7307020 weve been promised by the premier that cloncurry is not going to run out of water

7307032 he needs to take a huge amount of credit for qualifying eight boxers to come to these games
7307033 this very important discovery not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7307034 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7307035 because there are already drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma

7307038 i am someone you do not want to fuck with
7307039 for me this is a huge opportunity to potentially bridge the gap between being a professional player and having a proper job as a coach
7307040 coaching was never a lifetime ambition for me but certainly at the end of the season i will be looking more into which direction i go in
7307041 i am learning a lot working alongside the ulster coaches and there is plenty of knowledge to draw on every day
7307042 saving forest creatures by collecting excessive packaging and recycling it
7307043 we have to think about the patient and not be dogmatic about it
7307044 and thats the problem in canada were very dogmatic about public and private and you know this public and private system exists everywhere in the world except three countries canada cuba and north korea
7307045 for example a surgeon could do 90 per cent of his surgery in the public system but if theres no operating room available then he could do maybe five or 10 per cent of his practice in the private sector
7307046 but then you dont need to lose that surgeon in the public sector because hes doing a small part of his practice in the private sector
7307047 i think i need to get a bumper sticker that says i brake for graffiti
7307048 the isst have been alerted to a number of arrests in metropolitan and regional areas in australias east and are actively assessing these cases
7307049 one helpful tip with regards to influence is that whenever you see an influence bar up to the right of your minimap whether its filled up or empty a click in the bar will open your tome of knowledge to the proper location showing you to what the influence applies the influence rewards and your exact numerical progress towards that goal if you hover over the bar in the tok

7307086 well ai chan took your side in conversation with reina and you know how hostile minded she is toward you reina felt betrayed and left fortunately everything is ok now
7307087 no i wont help you out by killing you besides dont you see it natsumi you are already dead
7307088 well then explain to me explain me why did you cross out five years from your life just like that huh
7307089 and why should i explain myself to someone who never has been in a relationship in the first place
7307090 actually you are right what can someone like me know about love right
7307091 just tell me one thing look me in the eyes and tell me that you dont regret your decision
7307092 fine if you dont want then dont tell me but promise me one thing that youll go and explain everything to her if you that badly want to end that then at least do it properly not like some kind of coward
7307093 on a night like this when we were on tour yuko told me the story about werewolves i stated firmly that i didnt belive in any werewolves but ended up under your doors clutching a pillow in my arms and asking is it ok if ill sleep with you
7307094 yeah i remember you didnt want to admit that you were scared so you told me not to tell about that anyone
7307095 hey dont look at me like that i honestly didnt tell her
7307096 and remember when years later we both went to the cinema to watch that horror film about werewolves and the roles reversed
7307097 mhm then i was the one who had to assure you the whole night that they didnt exist
7307098 i i wanted to talk and you where were you
7307099 i mean i used that whole incident with my manager to end everything without even properly explaining things to you however i thought that that way i would free you from both me and those guys listen i realized that i was relying too much upon you taking you for granted using you not thinking about your feelings forgive me this i promise not to bother you anymore i know that now it may make no sense for you but i also know that someday you will understand this people love you and im sure you will have a great career i believe in you so yeah thats all what i wanted to say bye maki

7307168 ik loop deze race om aandacht te trekken voor een humanitaire kwestie die bijna vergeten is door de wereld we moeten er alles aan doen om te tonen in welke verschrikkelijke omstandigheden de sahrawi al meer dan 30 jaar leven en om het onrecht dat hen wordt aangedaan aan de kaak te stellen deze vluchtelingen hebben het recht om terug te keren naar de westelijke sahara hun thuisland maar marokko ontzegt hen dat fundamentele recht nog steeds
7307169 marokko boycot systematisch het vn vredesproces om zo tijd te winnen en de controle over de westelijke sahara te behouden we mogen n kunnen dat niet accepteren we moeten de vluchtelingen steunen in hun vreedzame strijd tegen de bezetting
7307170 the fact that im running this race is a modest attempt to gather attention for a cause that is loosing the awareness in the international community we must do all in our power to spread the word regarding the terrible conditions under which the sahrawi refugees are living and about the injustice that is caused upon them the sahrawi refugees has a legitimate right of return home to a free western sahara but morocco will not accept that
7307171 morocco is systematically obstructing the un peace process in order to gain time and control over western sahara we cannot accept that and must support the refugees peaceful struggle for freedom from occupation

7307186 het is net een jongensboek we hebben zolang naar dit succes toegeleefd jarenlang werden onze demos afgekeurd door de platenmaatschappijen nu zijn we in een stroomversnelling terecht gekomen we krijgen de ene na de andere prijs en hebben zelfs al opgetreden in suriname en op curacao ons eerste album werd platina en we hebben vorig jaar 430 optredens gedaan in het begin waren we blij met alles wat op ons pad kwam we zeiden overal ja op maar eigenlijk was dat te veel iedereen denkt dat we gek zijn en daar zit ook wel een kern van waarheid in toch is het wel super natuurlijk het staat goed op ons cv al denk ik niet dat we ooit nog nodig hebben we hebben het m geflikt
7307187 voor mij was het vrij snel duidelijk dat ik mijn studie niet zo afmaken we konden moeilijk aan onze fans vragen nog twee jaar te wachten met het kopen van onze single mijn moeder vond het niets dat ik wilde stoppen met mijn opleiding ze wilde dat mijn toekomst zeker zou zijn om die garantie geef ik weinig ik wil van het leven genieten op mijn vijftiende is mijn vader overleden aan kanker dat heeft me laten zien hoe relatief het leven is ik wil alles er uithalen wat erin zit en dat doe ik door voor de volle honderd procent voro nick en simon te gaan ons succes voelt wel dubbel mijn vader was zelf ook veel met muziek bezig en onze doorbraak heeft hij niet meer meegemaakt er zijn momenten waarop ik het daar heel moeilijk mee heb bijvoorbeeld toen ik hoorde dat een andere zanger zijn nieuwe single met zijn vader heeft opgenomen dan besef ik dat ik dat nooit kan daarom ben ik des te blijer dat mijn moeder het w l allemaal meemaakt nu ze ziet hoe goed het gaat staat ze er gelukkig ook helemaal achter
7307188 dit is niet normaal meestal zitten we in van die vieze rokerige kleedkamers met hoogstens een kop koffie een paar jaar geleden dacht ik nog dat beroemd zijn glitter en glamour betekent en dat je continu in de watten word gelegd het is heel anders het is gewoon noeste arbeid
7307189 dat is wel het minste wat we voor onze fans kunnen doen e n keer heb ik geweigerd omdat dat meisje al honderd keer met me op de foto was geweest ze keek toen zo verdrietig dat ik me er helemaal rot door voelde terwijl ze daarvoor geen optreden miste is ze toen maanden niet geweest sinsdien zeg ik nooit meer nee
7307190 annemarie en ik zien elkaar vaak maar een uurtje per dag sinds de zomder wonen we samen en ik vind het te gek het mooiste moment van mijn dag is als ik thuiskom en haar een beetje wakker maak ze is dan zo lief
7307191 ze is echt mijn rustpunt in de storm we hebben heel veel moeten praten voordat onze liefde te combineren was met mijn werk nu gaat het gelukkig goed
7307192 een stem in me zegt dat ik dit moet doen anders zou ik die dagen van twintig uur niet kunnen maken
7307193 het is heel leuk iedere dag is anders we ontmoeten veel mensen en komen op veel verschillende plaatsen roem heeft ook meer diepgang dan dat gisteren vroeg de presentator van een optreden of we kijk omhoog nog en keer wilden spelen voor een vrouw die hij aan de telefoon had zij heeft nog maar een paar maanden te leven en put kracht uit ons nummer ik kreeg kippen vel van tot in mijn tenen op zon moment voel ik heel sterk dat het er toe doet wat we doen
7307194 we waren al goede vrienden en dat is alleen nog maar versterkt als ik er even doorheen zit voelt nick perfect aan wat ik nodig heb dat hoeft m helemaal niet te zitten in diepe gesprekken vaak is een schouderklopje al genoeg op vrije dagen spreken we niet af dan bel ik toch iemand anders uit onze vriendengroep zoals jan smit nick heb ik dan wel genoeg gezien
7307195 gelukkig hebben we dit altijd bij ons dan zien we hem toch nog regelmatig
7307196 jaha als twee lelijke hermannen waren geweest wat het toch anders het is het totaalplaatje
7307197 dat zo veel meisjes verliefd op onz zijn vind ik alleen maar grappig het maakt me niets uit het hoort erbij
7307198 eigenlijk vind ik al die aandacht van vrouwen wel heel leuk ik doe er niets mee maar het is wel goed voor mijn zelfvertrouwen haha
7307199 iedere dag zijn we er wel mee bezig we zijn heel benieuwd wat de single doet
7307200 we krijgen dagelijks de tussenstand doorgebeld en dat is toch wel spannend we zouden n dezer dagen misschien wel op 1 kunnen komen
7307201 soms komt het wel eens voor dat je voor het vierde optreden van die dag even inzakt dat is voor ons dan een rustmoment maar als het eenmaal begint dan zijn we er weer helemaal
7307202 je wordt natuurlijk ook gedragen door het succes iedere zaal ontploft als we opkomen en de fans zingen de liedjes van voor naar achter mee dus een optreden vliegt ook eigenlijk voorbij
7307203 tja ze vragen ook vaak geniet je er wel van ik vind alles heel leuk maar het gaat ook erg hard allemaal dus ik weet eigenlijk niet eens of ik het wel besef
7307204 we treden veel op dus we zijn wel continu met het succes bezig op die manier genieten we er wel van we zitten er middenin maar als we onze real life soap terug kijken dan weten we van 95 niet meer dat we het hebben meegemaakt
7307205 wij hebben ook veel luisterliedjes die komen in discotheken en feesttenten niet tot zn recht in een theater des te meer het grappige is dat de theaters aanvankelijk niet zo in ons ge nteresseerd waren maar nu blijkt dat een groot deel van de abonnementhouders van de theaters ook komen dit betekent dat we de oudere doelgroep ook aan het veroveren zijn
7307206 de theatertour wordt helemaal super en met een liveband erbij is het ook vernieuwend
7307207 daarnaast zullen we ook onze eigen engelse nummers ten gehore brengen
7307208 we vinden de engelse nummers heel leuk om te doen voor de b kant van singles dit is leuk voor de fans dat is het idee erachter het zijn uitstapjes en niet bedoeld om een heel album mee te vullen
7307209 inspiratie ontstaat bijvoorbeeld door iets wat je op tv hebt gezien of wat je hebt meegemaakt
7307210 bij mij komt het vaak aanwaaien en dan zet ik het op papier
7307211 ik vond het acteren heel leuk allee nhet draaien duurde wel heel lang maar ik zou best nog wel eens een acteeruitstapje willen maken
7307212 nee helemaal niet ik juich nederlandstalige muziek juist toe zoals ook jeroen van der boom met zn succes ik vind dat helemaal super we vertegenwoordigen met zn allen de nederlandse muziek alles wat goed is zie ik niet als concurrent
7307213 eigenlijk is het een aaneenschakeling van hoogtepunten het winnen van de zilveren harp was fantastisch we hebben voor de tweede keer de originele rembrandt gewonnen twee keer platina in n jaar optreden op het amsterdamse museumplein ga zo maar door
7307214 het enige minpunt is eigenlijk dat je echt geen privacy meer hebt dat je soms even op onderbroek beneden loopt dat je denkt dit kan ik beter niet meer doen maar het hoort erbij
7307215 ook vind ik het soms wel eens jammer dat ik mn vrienden niet meer zoveel zie je hele priv leven wordt bijna opgeslokt maar daar staat tegenover dat je ook heel veel mooie dingen meemaakt en dat we muziek kunnen maken dat is toch wel het mooiste
7307216 soms zit het wel eens tegen stalken aan het kan wel heel ver gaan
7307217 ja er is ook een 46 jarige vrouw die claimt zwanger te zijn van mij van een tweeling een tweeling nog wel voor als ik het soms wou ontkennen
7307218 dan kan ze het natuurlijk mooi nick en simon noemen grapt simon direct
7307219 de krenten uit de pap zijn toch wel de trips zoals naar suriname en curacao
7307220 onlangs waren we nog in oostenrijk daar hebben we meegedaan aan het tros programma te land ter zee en in de lucht we gaan van de berg af voor het onderdeel blij dat ik glij
7307221 ik kwam het podium en toen hing het licht een beetje laag dus was het pok het deed heel zeer maar ik liet me natuurlijk niet kennen
7307222 ik heb geen echte grote blunders gehad wel vergat ik een keer de tekst van de soldaat terwijl ik die al duizend keer heb gezongen maar dat kan een keer gebeuren en is niet echt een blunder toch
7307223 met katie melua ze heeft een hele prettige stem ik denk dat dat wel kan matchen ze is ook heel aardig dus dat lijkt me heel leuk dan denk ik aan een up tempo nummer omdat ze zelf altijd heel rustige nummers uitbrengt
7307224 were in awe of the fact that little old delaware is playing a major role

7307236 en el primer tiempo cometimos errores los pagamos caro porque nos metieron tres goles en el segundo tiempo nos ponemos mucho mejor y lo definimos en tres contragolpes con los delanteros que tenemos que son muy importantes para nosotros y se hicieron presentes en el marcador
7307237 este triunfo es importante ten amos ese pendiente de que no hab amos ganado como visitantes y qu bueno que ahora lo conseguimos
7307238 volvimos a ser el equipo del torneo anterior que cuando nos hac an un gol reaccion bamos r pido en este torneo nos hab a constado trabajo hacer eso hoy lo demostramos en este partido estuvimos atr s y logramos recuperarnos para llevarnos un triunfo muy importante de esta cancha
7307239 creo que fue un gran partido nuestro a pesar de que cometimos algunos descuidos defensivos el equipo mostr esa personalidad que lo llev al campeonato el torneo anterior y nos vamos contentos gan ndole a un rival que juega bien que siempre propone y que es muy lindo para toda la gente
7307240 lo esperaba as porque este es el estilo que chivas tiene y nosotros tambi n nunca vamos para atr s siempre vamos para adelante se dio un buen partido y afortunadamente hoy nos toc ganar vamos bien estamos de menos a m s el inicio de torneo fue pesado porque hay mucha fatiga y un relax normal pero hoy estamos tranquilos porque las cosas se hicieron bien
7307241 gracias a dios pudimos conseguir los tres puntos pues desde que entramos al campo de juego esa era nuestra misi n y en el primer tiempo salimos bien pero en el segundo ten amos la mentalidad de remontar y poder ganar la obligaci n de uno es jugar muy bien y hoy nos sali todo a mat as a m y a ludue a todos pusimos de nuestra parte para poder ganar
7307242 yo vengo de una lesi n vengo de menos a m s y bueno espero seguir mejorando mi nivel e igual todos estamos recuperando nuestro nivel para as estar al 100 y dar batalla en este torneo no me siento al 100 ando a un 70 por ciento y todav a tengo un poco de molestia en la rodilla pero hay que seguir
7307243 tuvimos por ah errores pero lo ideal teniendo errores jugando bien o mal esto es de resultados y nos llevamos los tres puntos y eso nos va a servir
7307244 sin duda estamos muy tristes sobre todo por la afici n
7307245 sin duda estamos muy tristes sobre todo por la afici n porque urge una victoria aqu y no la hemos podido lograr pero este partido hay que olvidarlo y aprender de los errores para que no nos vuelva a suceder
7307246 est bamos haciendo un buen partido hubo detalles desconcentraciones en donde nos costaron goles y eso los levant a ellos todos intentamos en el primer tiempo est bamos arriba y en el segundo tiempo aflojamos un poco la verdad es que el equipo afloj poco y ah ellos nos hicieron da o
7307247 claro que nos preocupa los cinco goles en contra queremos que no nos vuelva a suceder es un aderrota que duele pero hay que levantar la cara y reponernos de esto
7307248 contentos satisfechos porque realmente este equipo est retomando su nivel este equipo juega bien sab amos que iba a ser un partido muy dif cil porque chivas tambi n juega bastante bien esta vez nos toc ser m s contundentes
7307249 va a mejorar reci n se incorpor ludue a daniel ben tez christian tambi n reci n est saliendo de una lesi n entonces el equipo ya cuando est completo va a ser otro sin duda
7307250 lo que me tenga que tocar eso lo debo de asumir
7307251 es una derrota dolorosa una derrota que hay que asumir responsabilidades y que tenemos mucho qu mejorar defensivamente
7307252 lo que me tenga que tocar eso lo debo de asumir estamos para seguir adelante al final de cuentas nos brindamos dentro de la cancha nunca dejamos de hacer lo que nos pidi el t cnico y simplemente fueron detalles que tenemos que mejorar
7307253 no estamos nada cerca tenemos que mejorar mucho ofensivamente hubo muchos destellos pero tenemos que darle esa solidez al equipo si queremos ganar este tipo de partidos
7307254 tambi n ellos intentaron tienen grandes jugadores nosotros les hicimos tres goles y no es f cil hac rselos
7307255 estamos tristes por haber perdido de esa manera creo que el equipo estaba haciendo bien las cosas cometimos errores y eso nos cost muy caro
7307256 fueron m s que nada errores de nosotros tuvimos llegada y goles pero muy r pido nos empataron y creo que el equipo debe de mejorar en eso y pensar qu es lo que sucedi

7307282 anwar in parliament is different from wan azizah in parliament there is this sense of strength especially for the voice of the people he is able to carry not only keadilan but also dap as well as pas
7307283 the price of petrol has gone down and so we are in the right direction if anwar can go into parliament you can imagine the weight of the peoples voices and we are hoping he will win
7307284 but it has been spiced up somewhat or spoilt by these allegations of sodomy you can see for sure it is political assassination by the way the case has been conducted one day anwar announces he is going to contest the next day the charges and supposedly a police report was filed which we did not see until six weeks later
7307285 unless of course he is arrested under isa his name will be there his place will be there but he will not be physically there thats one thing so far the will of the people and with the international eyes on malaysia i dont think that will happen
7307286 certainly the result of the next election will be very crucial if mayawati does succeed in becoming the prime minister of india then i think that in itself would have a huge impact on her constitution and that would in effect change the countrys politics very significantly
7307287 our resolve is strengthened to provide an alternative to ruling upa and opposition nda and coming together at the left front are mayawati devagowda and rld they will create a real force in the country which will be an alternative to the government and the so called opposition today

7307290 our central focus is the economy we lack direction we lack the vision it is blatantly corrupt the economy is being mismanaged how do they respond personal malicious attacks having datuk najib himself distribute these pamphlets from that sort of character standpoint so i still appeal to my supporters to get back and explain the issues
7307291 when you talk about the people here obviously they are looking at it from two perspectives they want their mp to deliver someone who is able to make a difference
7307292 some people are looking at it perhaps from the national perspective the whole question of credibility and the morality of the leader

7307431 klonen klinkt heel modern en boeiend je denkt meteen aan hippe filosofen die zich over de morele implicaties hebben gebogen maar het aardige van churchill is dat ze het thema vooral gebruikt voor een origineel plot churchill wil vragen stellen over vaders en zonen over opnieuw beginnen en het leven naar je hand willen zetten churchill giet deze intelligente grondstof in een stevig plot met sterke snelle dialogen van vaak onafgemaakte zinnen wat de toon heel naturel maakt regisseur ursul de geer koos voor een modern kale vormgeving stoelen en een tafel en een grijs gordijn met videoprojecties van de spelers de speelstijl is ook direct en to the point spelers eric schneider als de vader en marcel hensema als de zoon detoneren prettig met elkaar schneider heeft een bourgondische speelstijl bewust rommelig aangekleed naar binnen gericht hensema speelt juist open met alleen de nodige gebaren en gezichtsuitdrukkingen de acteurs kunnen laten zien hoe ze met hetzelfde gereedschap totaal verschillende mensen kunnen spelen hensema doet dit bewonderenswaardig goed subtiel maar duidelijk schakelt hij van beschaafde jongen naar borderliner en naar blije eikel

7307433 the fact theyre keeping protesters for 10 days rather than processing and deporting them indicates the chinese government is taking a more punitive approach
7307434 it suggests the government has been emboldened by the international communitys relative silence at the governments tactics perpetrated during the games
7307435 oma waarom liggen die kleine grafjes zo apart van de anderen en waarom zijn ze zo klein liggen daar huisdieren ofzo

7307437 i had to have injections for my neck and luckily i have got a great doctor and a great team or i might not have made it
7307438 as it was it was pretty tough in the race and i had a lot of pain but i dont think i lost any time in the race because of it i never lose time
7307439 i think the spasms started when i woke up at around 5 a m yesterday saturday and they were so bad i was struggling to stand up
7307440 i had to have injections in my neck and i took some painkillers and i got through it but it was tough pedro was looking forward to racing i know that
7307441 i have had a miserable weekend really from the day i arrived i have a lot of flu symptoms a fever every day
7307442 i have had low energy just felt poorly with problems with the spasms in my neck which led to me being in doubt for the weekend and obviously for this race
7307443 its nice to come somewhere knowing i had to play well and then actually do it we try to get ourselves to play as well as we can every week but i had two weeks to come to try and impress nick and show him i am playing okay and the first week is out of the way and i seem to have done that
7307444 as i said all week i was feeling comfortable out there and i think that was the key to my success this week
7307445 pretty good with this you never really know whats going to happen so i had to try and be sensible but it was pretty special with the boys here
7307446 this week with the barclays going on in america usually i go and do hospitality for them and play with the guys over there and they have been very kind they wanted me to come and play here this week and try and improve my ryder cup chances and i have managed to do that so hopefully ive pleased them as well
7307447 definitely weve been doing the same thing every night sitting watching a movie having a laugh and having a bit of fun and its the first time they have been at a tournament with me where i have managed to win so it was very special there on the 18th green
7307448 i dont know if ive done enough or not but im going to gleneagles now in better shape than i was seven days ago
7307449 i have won and ive won comfortably ive played well and ive played with one of the best players in the world today henrik and ive managed to play well and keep my nose in front so hopefully he will take notice

7307451 it is incredibly important for all nhs staff to carry out good hand hygiene practice as this simple precaution could potentially save lives
7307452 improving hand hygiene is important for everyone and we all share a duty to work together to prevent patients or service users picking up avoidable healthcare associated infec tions
7307453 good hand hygiene is critically important and we want to help staff to make healthcare safer for patients across all care settings
7307454 we have piloted the campaign with 19 organisations in the community from a range of care settings to refine it for wider implementation
7307455 improving hand hygiene across all settings will also help to cut the risk of cross transmission
7307456 patients and service users particularly elderly and vulnerable often move frequently between care settings for example from hospital to care home and back again

7307477 i think that given the historical situation of fujimoris trial it was not very practical that a commission so important as the constitutional accusations be placed in the hands of a blatant representative of fujimorismo this is a historical trial the trial of the century and i obviously cannot fail to express the majority of the judicial powers feelings on what is being commented i trust in the professional quality of the jurisdictional body that is in charge of this trial and we are prepared to resist any attempt at pressuring furthermore i know mrs moyano she is qualified and i hope that she does not use pressure

7307889 my goal is to make d c the highest performing urban school system in the country
7307890 people want michelle rhee to succeed because no one knows whats going to happen if she doesnt
7307891 i consider it the most difficult job i ever had
7307892 youve had so many varying actors pulling on the school system with such strength that ultimately it went nowhere
7307893 anyone who raises concern is labeled as being for the status quo
7307894 its the fad of the month the flavor of the year
7307895 some additional strengthening is possible before julio reaches the baja peninsula later today and weakening is forecast to begin by monday
7307896 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7307897 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
7307898 include that drilling let it compete and see where we come down on it and if that in fact is a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7307899 oh my god damn son of a bitch what the hell
7307900 for the love of god t what are you trying to do trying to take this where you dont want it
7307901 after securing a search warrant for a residence mr jennings frequented a surveillance unit spotted him near the tualatin public library and followed him to the tualatin community city park he was taken into custody a short time later after exiting the mens restroom
7307902 fiquei o tempo inteiro deitada com um tubo na boca foi desconfort vel
7307903 eu estava muito abalada ainda todos me trataram com muito cuidado foi uma seq ncia muito dif cil de fazer mas fiquei bastante feliz com o que foi exibido
7307904 ik bin gebore uit sonneglore en een sucht fan de siedende see
7307905 uit een zomerkrootje en de pit van een sappige pruim en dat kan precies kloppen met de geboortemaand van mijn tweelingzus en mij namelijk augustus
7307906 waarde vriend wij hebben een afspraak voor vandaag en daarom zeg ik er maar niet teveel van maar wees ervan overtuigd dat op zulke vloeken wel eens heel snel een straf uit de hemel zou kunnen volgen
7307907 als u zo nodig uw hart moet luchten waarom dan zon afgrijselijke rollende godslastering u zou toch bijvoorbeeld ook rhododendron kunnen zeggen dat rolt ook lekker en lucht ook op
7307908 dus als ik het goed begrepen heb heb jij een rode en een paarse godverdomme in de tuin
7307909 nou dat treft mijnheer zijn vader heeft een schuur vol
7307910 ik zou het allemaal heel anders hebben aangepakt mij hadden ze nooit gepakt sufferd dat je niet meteen door had wie het gedaan had
7307911 hoe weet je nu precies wanneer je op moet halen
7307912 ik wacht tot de snoek met het visje in zijn bek wegzwemt en dan probeer ik hem vast te tikken
7307913 vroeger deed mijn man het ook wel eens maar hij kon het niet zo goed als jij hij bracht er wel eens n mee naar huis maar ik heb hem er vaak van verdacht dat hij die gekocht of gekregen had maar ze smaken prima
7307914 nou nee ik lust graag een mootje snoek maar ik zou niet weten hoe ik zon beest schoon moest maken
7307915 dat doe ik toch even voor u dat is zo gebeurd hoor maar wacht even dan zet ik er even een ander aasvisje op dan kan de productie doorgaan
7307916 kom dan even binnen want zo warm is het niet vandaag
7307917 die meubeltjes hebben wij samen gekocht in het verre oosten toen ik een reis met mijn man meemaakte hoe vind je het
7307918 fantastisch vind ik het helemaal niet wat je op ons dorp zou verwachten
7307919 mijn man heeft er helaas niet lang plezier van gehad want een jaar later is hij verongelukt maar daar zullen wij het nu niet over hebben je zult die geschiedenis wel al vaak gehoord hebben het is ongelooflijk gewoon intussen al bijna tien jaar geleden
7307920 ja dat wil zeggen mijn man heeft een verzameling aangelegd die steeds groeide door zijn vele reizen alles heeft betrekking op de zeevaart ik ben lid van een filatelistenvereniging soms krijg ik wel eens bezoek van ge nteresseerde leden en af en toe vul ik de verzameling nog wel eens een beetje aan maar ik heb eigenlijk meer belangstelling voor munten
7307921 nou ik vroeg mij eigenlijk af wat voor een kapitaaltje hier voor mij op tafel ligt ik heb er wel niet zoveel verstand van maar die hele verzameling zal toch wel een ton waard zijn schat ik zo
7307922 dat kan best maar zo precies weet ik het ook niet
7307923 verzekerd nee eigenlijk nooit aan gedacht oh ja de voorzitter van onze postzegelclub begon daar laatst ook al over maar er wordt op ons dorp toch nooit gestolen
7307924 nou als n of andere slechterik er de lucht van krijgt dan zou u toch wel eens van een koude kermis thuis kunnen komen als ik u was maar waar bergt u dit spul eigenlijk op als u niet thuis bent en s nachts
7307925 en dat sleuteltje dat neemt u dan toch wel mee
7307926 soms wel maar ik moet eerlijk toegeven dat ik het ook wel eens vergeet
7307927 nou sorry hoor juffrouw coby ik mag mij natuurlijk niet met uw zaken bemoeien maar dit vind ik toch niet verantwoord er staat hier misschien wel voor tienduizenden guldens aan verzamelingen onbeschermd en onverzekerd
7307928 nou boos is niet het goede woord maar ik begrijp het toch niet erg goed
7307929 ik zal er nog wel eens over denken zo goed
7307930 boven slaap ik en mijn man heeft dit systeem bedacht ik haal s avonds de ladder naar beneden en als ik boven ben kan ik hem heel gemakkelijk weer omhoog klappen omdat er een contragewicht aan zit boven kan ik er dan twee beugels overheen vast zetten niemand kan hem dan naar beneden halen en ik zit zo veilig als in abrahams schoot dat wilde mijn man zo omdat ik zo vaak alleen was
7307931 oh die huizen zijn zo laag hier ik zit zo in de dakgoot te gillen als het zou gebeuren
7307932 maar dan kunt u die albums toch ook wel mee naar boven nemen
7307933 begin je nu weer nee hoor dat deed mijn man wel altijd maar het is mij teveel gesleep
7307934 en toch vind ik het spijt mij dat ik daar nu weer over begin het tegenover uw dochter niet verantwoord dat u zoveel risico loopt
7307935 ik zal er nog eens over denken tot ziens h
7307936 ja je spreekt met coby van de zee hallo kees
7307937 oh dag juffrouw coby wat een verrassing kan ik wat voor u doen
7307938 nou ik wou je wat vragen zou jij voor mij een goede verzekeringsmaatschappij weten voor mijn munten en mijn zegels ik heb er nog eens over nagedacht en ik ben het achteraf toch wel met je eens maar ik heb helemaal geen verstand van die dingen en ik denk mijn dochter en schoonzoon ook niet dus ik dacht
7307939 oh bedankt maar eh zou je dan zelf ook even kunnen komen of heb je daar geen tijd voor ik wil er best voor betalen hoor
7307940 nou moet u mij niet beledigen anders krijgt u nooit meer een snoek van mij ik wil u best helpen maar dat moet dan wel op een avond gebeuren en uiteraard niet tegen betaling
7307941 oh alle avonden zijn goed behalve donderdag want dat is de vaste dag waarop ik naar mijn dochter ga
7307942 maar heeft dit spul nu al die tijd onverzekerd in dat kastje gelegen
7307943 ik ben er altijd van uitgegaan dat er sinds mensenheugenis op dit dorp nooit is ingebroken tot kees toevallig eens hier in huis kwam en mij wakker schudde
7307944 daar hebt u goed aan gedaan mijnheer van rietschoten want dit risico is inderdaad veel te groot ik heb wel een idee hoe wij dit moeten aanpakken ten eerste er moet een kluis komen bijvoorbeeld een ingemetseld brandvrij kastje op de plaats waar nu dat wandkastje is ten tweede er moet een volledige catalogus worden aangelegd van alle aanwezige zegels en munten eens per jaar moeten wij inventariseren welke mutaties er in de loop van dat jaar hebben plaatsgevonden en het verzekerd bedrag en eventueel ook de premie aanpassen en dan wil ik nu graag even naar uw sloten kijken kan dat even
7307945 nou de voordeur is ok maar als u weggaat laat u dan nooit een sleutel in de deur achter want dan zou u bij een schade problemen met de verzekeringsmaatschappij kunnen krijgen omdat u een vluchtweg hebt opengelaten en mijnheer van rietschoten kan u vertellen hoe lastig die jongens dan kunnen zijn
7307946 en nu achter op de buitendeur zit een goed slot zie ik ja prima nou die ruiten kun je toch niet beveiligen althans niet zonder grote kosten maar dat eisen wij niet verder is er nog een slot op de deur van de keuken naar de kamer nou als u alles goed afsluit s avonds en als u ergens heen gaat en u hebt straks die brandkast dan is de zaak wel gezond u gaat zon ding kopen
7307947 nou dat kunt u beter in marktstad even informeren op de smalleweg is een ijzerhandel die brandkasten verkoopt die kunnen u vast wel een goed advies geven
7307948 als het mevrouw schikt dan wil ik graag morgen onze filatelistische deskundige meenemen die heeft trouwens ook verstand van munten kan dat mevrouw
7307949 ik hoop dat hij aan een ochtendje genoeg heeft want dan kan ik u de dag daarop wel vertellen wat u aan premie kwijt bent brand en inbraak zeker
7307950 mooi bedankt voor uw koffie en u mijnheer van rietschoten bedankt voor uw tip de maatschappij zal dit erg op prijs stellen en eh mevrouw neemt u de handel vanavond wel mee naar boven stel je voor dat er vannacht ingebroken wordt dan ben ik mijn mooie postje kwijt
7307951 zeg kees kun jij niet even met mij mee voor die kast dan ben je erg lief
7307952 u ben donderdag om een uur of elf bij uw dochter kom dan maar naar mijn kantoor dan gaan we samen naar die ijzerboer en dan ga ik nu gauw naar huis want het is morgen weer vroeg dag
7307953 hartstikke bedankt voor alles en tot donderdag dan en wil je dan alsjeblieft dat u vervangen door jij
7307954 kees hallo ik stond al naar je uit te kijken kun je even binnenkomen
7307955 zo dat ziet er goed uit zeg ben je nu ook niet blij dat het voor elkaar is en heb je de polis ook al valt de premie mee of tegen
7307956 zo dat zijn een hoop vragen tegelijk zeg ja ik ben blij ja ik heb de polis ja ik ken de kosten maar ik heb nog niets getekend ik wou zo graag dat jij er even naar keek doe je dat even dan zet ik koffie
7307957 nou het valt mij lang niet tegen maar ik wou je wat voorstellen die agent vonden wij allebei een aardige knul vriendelijk hulpvaardig en openhartig zou ik hem morgen nou niet even opbellen en hem vragen op een avondje nog wat toelichting te geven
7307958 oh kees ik durfde het je niet te vragen maar als je dat zou willen doen heel erg graag
7307959 je sleutels kijk aan de voordeur zag ik twee sleutels tegelijk n in het slot en n er aan vast met een ijzerdraadje en zowel in de kamer keukendeur als in de achterdeur zit een sleutel met een tweede exemplaar aan een touwtje hoeveel sleutels heeft je brandkast
7307960 oh wat leuk en zijn die voor mij en hoe werkt dat in de praktijk
7307961 nou ik heb die twee nummers van jou kijk maar een rode 431 en een witte 432 ingeschreven in ons register met jouw naam erbij wordt zon sleutelbos nu bij ons aangeboden dan krijgt de eerlijke vinder een kleine beloning vaak zijn het kinderen zijn het jongens dan krijgen ze bijvoorbeeld een voetbal meisjes een pop of een springtouw volwassenen een paraplu of en portemonnee enzovoort enzovoort dat werkt prima en nu zul je je afvragen waarom wij dan niet gewoon naam en adres van de eigenaar of eigenaresse op de sleutelhanger laten zetten dan kan die zelf zijn eigendom weer in ontvangst nemen maar dat doen wij niet uit veiligheidsoverwegingen zou zon sleutelbos worden gevonden door een verkeerde dan zou die eenvoudig naar dat adres kunnen gaan om heel makkelijk in te breken daarom is het register ook heel vertrouwelijk snap je
7307962 om u te dienen freule je weet dat ik beroepshalve nogal met misdaad te maken heb dus leer je een beetje in die trant denken
7307963 zijn daar kosten aan verbonden dat moet jullie wel wat kosten aan premies en die hangers zijn ook niet zo goedkoop
7307964 nee hoor geen kosten wij zien dit als een goede service aan onze lezer en boeken de kosten gewoon af op ons reclamebudget
7307965 nee wacht nou even ik ga dit nu ook helemaal af maken ik loop even langs je deuren en maak de twee sleutelhangers compleet met aan elk een sleutel van iedere deur dus een voordeursleutel een brandkastsleutel en de twee stuks van je kamer keukendeur en je achterdeur dus vier in totaal heb je nog meer sleutels die er aan zouden moeten
7307966 even kijken nee ik geloof het niet de deur naar de hal heeft geen sleutel en de sleutels waar ik de ladder boven mee vastzet kunnen daar beter blijven en ja mijn kleerkasten zijn ook boven wat ik echt aan waarde in huis heb zit nu in de brandkast k mijn sieraden
7307967 prima nou dan heb je hier twee complete sets sleutels het zal wel even wennen zijn maar leer die nou goed te hanteren dan zul je zien hoe gemakkelijk het gaat en waar laat je ze nou
7307968 ja goed maar overdag en als je uitgaat naar je dochter bijvoorbeeld ben je wel eens een sleutel kwijtgeraakt
7307969 oh meermalen maar ik heb ze altijd teruggekregen of teruggevonden meestal laat ik mijn sleutel liggen op de toonbank in een winkel of een balie in de bank of op een tafeltje als ik in een restaurant een kopje koffie drink uit mijn tas gevallen zijn ze geloof ik nog nooit en mijn tas ben ik nog nooit kwijt geweest
7307970 goed dan moet je het zo doen stop n bos sleutels diep in een binnenvakje van je tas en de andere gewoon in je mantelzak en er natuurlijk om denken als je jas of tas wisselt de boel even ompakken wat die tas betreft jullie vrouwen hebben daar toch altijd zoveel spulletjes in zitten dat het alleen maar een kwestie van goed onthouden is om daar de sleutelbos voortaan bij te rekenen en dat lijkt allemaal erg ingewikkeld maar je zult zien dat je er na een paar weken zo op ingesteld bent dat het automatisch gaat sleuteldiscipline heet dat en verlies je ze een keer misschien dat ome kees ze dan wel op zijn bureau krijgt in ieder geval mag je de sleutels niet meer in de deur laten zitten dus wen maar gauw aan de nieuwe toestand en kijk niet zo sip
7307971 nou ja wat een poespas allemaal voor een paar van die rot postzegels ik wou dat ze maar gauw gestolen werden dan krijg ik mijn geld en dat zet ik dan lekker op de bank dan heb ik er geen omkijken naar
7307972 wel als ze nu toch gestolen moeten worden dan wil ik je daar wel een handje bij helpen
7307973 kees ik verveel me rot er zit helemaal geen spanning en variatie meer in mijn leven ik zou wel eens iets heel gevaarlijks willen doen een leuke kraak zetten bijvoorbeeld waar een lekkere duit aan overblijft niet direct voor het geld maar vooral ook om de spanning en het is meestal zo hoe groter de buit hoe groter de spanning weet jij als deskundige niet iets anders ga ik maar parachutespringen of bergen beklimmen heus ik meen het echt
7307974 ik zal je eens wat vertellen ik weet een fantastisch mooie klus waar een dot poen in zit en waar niemand schade van heeft behalve een zekere verzekeringsmaatschappij waar ik eigenlijk nog een appeltje mee te schillen heb
7307975 wat jij dus wilt is die boel inpikken en de verzekering laten betalen aan coby van de zee en wat moet je dan met die handel
7307976 dat weet ik nog niet maar om te beginnen is er een grote kans dat varia v r zo heet die verzekeringsmaatschappij een forse beloning zal uitloven
7307977 en hoe wij die dan incasseren dat weet je ook nog niet
7307978 nee natuurlijk niet dat is fase 2 als we eerst de albums maar in handen hebben
7307979 ik doe mee ik vind dit een machtig mooie klus als ik ingeschakeld kan worden ben ik je hartstikke dankbaar
7307980 zeg ria waarom willen we dit nou eigenlijk kan jij dat verklaren wij hebben goede banen wij hebben een strenge opvoeding gehad van ouders die de degelijkheid in eigen persoon waren en toch hunkeren wij en ik van tijd tot tijd naar zoiets
7307981 ik weet het niet ik zou de melkboer nog voor geen dubbeltje beduvelen maar zoiets graag liever vandaag dan morgen natuurlijk geeft dit een gespleten moraal aan maar ik zit daar niet mee ik slaap er niet minder om ik bid toch zondag in de kerk rustig tot god en probeer niet het te verklaren wel geloof ik dat de krachtmeting een uitdaging betekent onze intelligentie tegen die van de wetsdienaren maar om te zoeken naar de oorzaken van die oneerlijke trek in onze karakters nee hoor aan mijn lijf geen psychiater en al zouden die uitvissen welke verdrongen complexen hier achter zitten wat win je dan met die wijsheid je kunt het toch niet terugdraaien en erfelijke aanleg als dat het dan is is toch niet te corrigeren
7307982 zo dat was een hele tirade zus maar ik denk er net zo over dus vooruit met de geit wat doen we als allereerste denk jij
7307983 mij lijkt het binnendringen in het huis en het bemachtigen van die brandkastsleutel het allerbelangrijkste om mee te beginnen hoe flik je dat
7307984 nou dat binnendringen is niet zo moeilijk want als straks het snoekseizoen weer opengaat kom ik toch vrij regelmatig in huis maar die sleutels dat is een andere kwestie er zijn twee deuren te openen voor je in de kamer bent want de voordeur is te link al loopt er s avonds dan geen hond op straat in onze stad maar die twee sloten zijn heel eenvoudig de sleutels zijn gewone standaardsleutels dus als ik de nummers opneem koop ik in de eerste de beste ijzerwinkel kopiesleutels niet dat ik dat in de eerste de beste doe natuurlijk niet want juist deze kleine slordigheden zijn vaak oorzaak van ontdekking die dingen kopen wij of liever dat doe jij in een grote stad ergens in ons land en twee sleutels in twee aparte zaken veiligheid voor alles maar de brandkastsleutel is een groot probleem want die moet gemaakt worden en nou heb ik coby juist zover dat zij niet meer zo slordig met die sleutels omgaat maar de sleutelhanger met die vier sleutels hangt wel eens aan de brandkast als ik binnenkom de nummers van die twee sleutels noteer ik dan wel de brandkastsleutel ja daar zal ik met een wasplaatje wasafdrukken van moeten maken en dat is tevens een zwakke schakel in het plan kijk coby mag geen enkel risico lopen dat de verzekering niet zou uitbetalen er moeten duidelijke sporen van braak achterblijven en daarom is het te overwegen de sleutels na de inbraak achter te laten een nadeel van zon valse sleutel is dat dit de politie direct op het idee zal brengen dat de dader in de kennissenkring van coby te vinden moet zijn want hoe komt de inbreker anders aan zon brandkastsleutel ik behoor zelf tot de kennissenkring maar zij heeft een flinke aanloop zodat ik n van de velen ben ik zal voor de nodige mistgordijnen moeten zorgen maar daar vind ik wel wat op
7307985 nou dat geeft niet ik volg je met spanning maar als ik dan wat vragen mag heb jij zon wasplaatje en weet je een adres waar je zonder risico zon sleutel kan laten maken
7307986 nou onderschat je mij ik zit niet voor niets al jaren in de misdaadverslaggeverij nee dat is niet zon groot probleem maar voor het maken van die afdruk moet je net even de gelegenheid hebben je kunt dat plaatje het beste bij je hebben en in je zak dragen liefst een binnenzak want door je lichaamswarmte blijft het spul dan zacht genoeg om meteen te gebruiken maar forceren doen wij niets de gelegenheid moet zich gewoon voordoen je kunt nog wel wat doen koop ergens maar denk erom ver van patersdijck twee oude schrijfmachines liefst op twee adressen ze moeten wel goed zijn en als je die dingen koopt vermom je dan een beetje je was daar vroeger een kei in en dat kan nu prima van pas komen wat ik ermee moet dat hoor je nog wel zuslief
7307987 zo en nu praten we over wat anders en krijg ik een sherrytje van je
7307988 o heerlijk kees dat is weer de eerste van dit najaar maak jij hem even schoon dan zet ik de koffiepot aan maar ik haal even een koekje bij de bakker ik ben zo terug
7307989 hoe heb je die nummers van mij doorgekregen ook van een papiertje
7307990 nee je hebt ze geloof ik zo opgegeven oh ik snap het al ja stom van mij zeg
7307991 je zegt het zelf maar leer nu van mij dat dit soort kleinigheden het verschil kunnen uitmaken tussen falen en succes hebben dus wat doe je
7307992 ik zal ze even uit mijn hoofd leren baas en dat papiertje in de open haard gooien als ik ze vergeet dan kan ik altijd op jou terugvallen want bij jou zitten ze al vast in het koppie
7307993 nou ja ik mot uitkijke versliecheraars zijn er altijd maar waar mot u dat kientje voor hebbe ken ik meedoen
7307994 nee je maakt alleen die sleutel en voor de rest geen flauwekul en doe het nou maar want anders haal ik nog een paar herinneringen uit je dossier
7307995 o k meester overmorgen klaar waar kan ik hem bezorgen
7307996 kom hein je hebt niet met een groenzoeter te maken we spreken dit af ik zie je overmorgen om drie uur in de hal van het centraal station en denk erom geen geintjes
7307997 en wat leist ik voor die klus een rooie zeker
7307998 je rooie zuster zal je bedoelen nee hein het is met vijf meier heel heel goed betaald maar ik weet dat je een vakman bent en denk erom wasplaatje terug h
7307999 nou vooruit dan maar al zal ik er niet rijk van worden
7308000 nou je kans afwachten en hup met de geit inbreken zou ik zeggen
7308001 dat is dan mooi fout en ik zal je zeggen waarom kijk bijgemaakte sleutels zijn altijd een risico als er een haartje verschil is pakken ze soms niet en ik wil voor geen geld s nachts in de zenuwen zitten omdat ik dan plotseling die kast niet open kan krijgen en alle moeite vergeefs is
7308002 nou kijk ik heb mijn kans af moeten wachten om die sleutels te kunnen krijgen ik wacht nu weer op een kans ze even snel te proberen en dat lukt beslist wel binnenkort gesnopen zussie
7308003 tjee jij denkt ook aan alles zeg wat een uitgeslapen boef ben jij
7308004 oh kees ik zou net even naar de slager was je nog van plan koffie te komen drinken heb je al wat gevangen vind je het ook zo koud
7308005 op alle vragen is het antwoord nee maar het antwoord op de eerste vraag kan worden omgedraaid als je terugkomt van de slager heb ik de koffie klaar tenminste als ik er in mag
7308006 natuurlijk gek ik laat de deur los dan kun je je warmen als je wilt
7308007 u bent wel optimistisch van schaatsen komt niks vandaag de baan is helemaal ondergesneeuwd
7308008 nou als ik de weerberichten zo hoor dan zou ik maar maken dat ik thuiskwam want ik weet niet of die bussen nog kunnen blijven rijden met al die sneeuw
7308009 nou dan loop ik nog maar even het dorp in t zal er wel mooi uitzien met al die sneeuw tot ziens mijnheer
7308010 ja lekker maar dan over een minuut of twintig ik ga nog even de post doornemen en misschien een paar telefoontjes doen wat een weer h
7308011 nou zeg dat wel zeg dan blijf ik nog even luisteren tot zo h
7308012 er is ingebroken bij coby van der zee al haar postzegels en munten zijn gestolen
7308013 hoe kan dat nou ze had toch een safe hebben ze die open gebrand
7308014 ja precies weet ik het ook niet maar ze schijnt het vanmorgen pas te hebben ontdekt omdat er deuren open waren
7308015 maar wanneer is dat dan gebeurd vannacht met dat hondenweer
7308016 dat kan wel maar ik hoorde dat ze gisteren bij haar dochter in marktstad was geweest en toen ze thuis kwam meteen naar bed was gegaan ze ontdekte het vanmorgen pas maar het kan natuurlijk ook overdag gebeurd zijn want ze was de hele dag niet thuis oh jongen ik ben er helemaal zenuwachtig van ik weet mij niet te herinneren dat er in slootwetering ooit is ingebroken kom je naar huis dat is toch een leuke hoe noemen jullie dat een leuke premi re voor je
7308017 maar fijn dat je gebeld hebt ik kom er aan
7308018 ja mijn moeder belde mij op nou toen ben ik hierheen gevlogen een inbraak in slootwetering het oudste mens weet er niet van hot news voor mijn krant
7308019 wat een geluk dat je mij toen dat advies hebt gegeven voor die verzekering zeg wat denk je zouden ze hier nu ook over gaan chicaneren
7308020 nou dat verwacht ik niet maar hoe is het volgens jou gegaan en wanneer zou het gebeurd moeten zijn
7308021 ik denk gisteren maar vannacht kan ook wel in ieder geval tussen gisterochtend half tien en vanmorgen toen ik het ontdekte ik ben om half tien naar mijn dochter gegaan het was immers donderdag en ik ben gisteravond om een uur of twaalf thuisgekomen misschien een beetje later want de bus reed niet zo hard met die sneeuw
7308022 nee het was erg koud in huis ik ben rechtstreeks naar boven gegaan en pas vanmorgen zag ik dat er een deur los was en dat er een raam in de bijkeuken kapot was ik dacht eerst dat dat door de storm was gekomen maar ik werd een beetje ongerust over die deur eerst dacht ik nog dat ik misschien zelf weer geblunderd had met het op slot doen ervan maar toen ben ik in de brandkast gaan kijken nou je begrijpt dat ik me een hoedje schrok ik heb toen meteen de politie gebeld en die heb ik dit zelfde verhaal verteld
7308023 inspecteur van der waal had naar hij meende onopgemerkt ons gesprek beluisterd en kwam nu met de vraag
7308024 kees jij hebt als ik het goed heb begrepen de verzekering voor die zegels en munten geregeld
7308025 zeg waar wil je eigenlijk heen denk je dat ik dat spul gepikt heb
7308026 om op je vraag te antwoorden ik ben met mevrouw van de zee mee geweest om die kast uit te zoeken maar verder is dat ook allemaal door de verzekering geregeld
7308027 hoeveel sleutels zijn er bij die kluis twee of drie
7308028 twee ik heb twee sleutelbossen want ik ben zo hopeloos slordig dat ik er eens n ergens laat liggen en dan kan ik mij toch redden
7308029 en hebt u die alle twee in uw tas en alle twee met die kluissleutel er aan
7308030 maar ik bewaar ze altijd los van elkaar n in mijn tas en n in mijn mantelzak dat heeft de heer van rietschoten mij geadviseerd
7308031 kees wat ga je hierover publiceren mag ik je vragen het voorlopig te houden bij een publicatie zonder al te veel details ik zou het liefst eigenlijk nog helemaal niets in de krant willen hebben maar er weten al zoveel mensen van dat dat moeilijk zal gaan ik wil graag dat je en je weet met jouw schrijfervaring precies wat ik bedoel geen dingen schrijft waar de dader wat mee kan doen
7308032 ok dat beloof ik graag maar als je de zaak helemaal vrij geeft dan wel de primeur voor mijn krant h
7308033 je weet toch zeker dat je geen fout hebt gemaakt h kees die dick van der waal is een linkmiechel hoor die pak je niet zo makkelijk in
7308034 nou hij mij ook niet en ga jij nu maar rustig slapen want het is beslist perfect gelukt eerlijk gezegd denk ik dat hij mij binnenkort wel zal bellen en dan heb ik nog wel een paar leuke troeven achter de hand dus slaap maar lekker meid
7308035 nou wat denk je over die inbraak in jullie wereldstad natuurlijk
7308036 nou nee dat niet direct maar ik heb je beloofd dat ik als ik de boel vrij gaf voor de pers eerst jou zou inlichten en nu is het zover
7308037 nee was het maar waar maar ik wel een theorie die ik graag eens aan je zou willen voorleggen eigenlijk wil ik eens praten met een intelligente autochtoon
7308038 en daar heb je mij voor uitgekozen nou bedankt voor het compliment wanneer doen we dat en waar
7308039 kun je morgenmiddag bij mij op het bureau komen om twee uur bijvoorbeeld
7308040 hol zeg je nou zie ik waar mijn belastingcenten aan worden besteed ik heb veel simenons gelezen en ik heb altijd gedacht dat jullie er allemaal bij zaten als commissaris maigret maar daar heb ik me dan toch mooi in vergist
7308041 het is ook niet altijd zo geweest als nu maar bij zon nieuwbouw kun je wel eens leuk spelen met de ruimte wat drink je
7308042 zal ik koffie laten komen of heb je liever een kopje thee of wat sterkers een whisky of een cognacje zeg het maar
7308043 nou ter zake ik heb je gevraagd even een boom op te komen zetten over een theorie die ik ontwikkeld heb over die zaak in slootwetering jij kent de situatie daar als je broekzak en ik wou jou graag als klankbord gebruiken o k
7308044 kijk ik ben er vanuit gegaan dat de dader niet van buiten het dorp komt en wel om de volgende redenen wie kon weten dat de kust op donderdag veilig was een buitenstaander nauwelijks aan te nemen toeval niet zo erg waarschijnlijk wie wist van die kostbare verzameling een buitenstaander ik geloof er niets van wie wist zo nauwkeurig de inrichting van het huis iemand van buiten het dorp hoe zou dat kunnen wie had de gelegenheid om een kopie van de brandkastsleutel te maken en het nummer van de andere sleutel te noteren enfin ik heb over de zaak nadenkende geen andere conclusie kunnen trekken dan de dader is een inwoner van slootwetering
7308045 nu houd ik erg van visuele hulpmiddelen om mijn gedachten te concentreren daarom teken ik op dit schoolbord dat tegenover zijn bureau aan de wand hing een grote rode cirkel voorstellende alle bewoners van slootwetering het middelpunt van die cirkel is de dader maar het is natuurlijk onzin om alle inwoners als verdacht te beschouwen en daarom teken ik een kleinere gele cirkel daarbinnen dat zijn de mensen die mevrouw van de zee kennen en uit de gesprekken die mijn medewerkers intussen met vrijwel alle bewoners hebben gevoerd en ook volgens haarzelf blijken dat er nogal wat te zijn
7308046 tot zover kan ik je goed volgen maar ga door
7308047 nu teken ik binnen de cirkel een blauwe cirkel en dat zijn dan de mensen die mevrouw van de zee niet alleen kennen maar ook wel eens bij haar over de vloer komen het kaartclubje koffiedrinksters het handwerkclubje enfin noem maar op de namen heb ik hier
7308048 wil jij nu eens je mening geven over deze mensen met betrekking tot die inbraak
7308049 nee dat wil ik niet tenminste niet zonder een aantal voorwaarden waarde vriend wat verlang je nu eigenlijk van mij ben ik een onbezoldigd politiemedewerker geworden nee ik wil je best helpen maar nogmaals onder zeer strenge voorwaarden
7308050 dick je weet of misschien weet je dat niet hoe dat in zon kleine toch tamelijk besloten gemeenschap gaat ik hoor tot die gemeenschap en ik wil dat zo houden naar buiten toe is zon gemeenschap hecht en bij alle onderlinge twisten ruzies en roddels blijft dat bolwerk bestaan als ik vandaag met een dorpsgenoot een fikse ruzie heb en hij raakt morgen op de markt in marktstad in een vechtpartij gewikkeld dan ga ik hem toch helpen daar zijn ongeschreven wetten voor die koste wat het kost gehandhaafd blijven wie daar niet aan voldoet is snel een paria en dat is heel vervelend en knap lastig dus om op je vraag terug te komen ik wil de namen best bekijken maar ik schrap alleen de namen door die het naar mijn oordeel beslist niet gedaan hebben maar dat wil dan en begrijp dat nu heel goed beslist niet zeggen dat ik de overgeblevenen wel in staat acht zon inbraak te plegen ik heb dan ook de strenge voorwaarde dat er over ons gesprek geen woord uitlekt
7308051 zo dat was een hele tirade maar ik wist niet dat de dorpsmaffia zo ver reikte
7308052 ho stop nou even sla nu niet op hol dick dat is helemaal geen maffia maar eenvoudig de mentaliteit die gesloten gemeenschappen uit wel begrepen eigenbelang onbewust in de loop der eeuwen hebben opgebouwd en als je dat niet aanstaat of als je dat niet begrijpt dan kunnen wij ons gesprek beter be indigen
7308053 o k kees ik denk dat ik het toch wel een beetje begrijp ik zal mijn vragen daaraan aanpassen en ik beloof je dat dit onderhoud voor 100 onder ons blijft goed
7308054 nou prima dan maar schenk me eerst nog maar eens in een mens zou van al dat praten een droge keel krijgen die lijst zal ik wat korter voor je maken maar ik wil toch eerst nog even de vraag op tafel leggen of je uitgangspunt nu wel juist is ik ga in je mooie ballonnetje een prik geven ik begrijp je je probeert langs de weg van eliminatie heel wetenschappelijk een klein lijstje met potenti le daders over te houden waarvan je vervolgens de alibis gaat onderzoeken op zich erg boeiend maar de basistheorie is en blijft dat de dader een inwoner van slootwetering is ik ga in die mooie cirkeltjes van jou een paar gaten maken kijk zo
7308055 en waarom doe ik dat inspecteur ik geloof nu eenmaal niet onvoorwaardelijk in die basistheorie wat denk je bijvoorbeeld van de filatelisten die van tijd tot tijd bij mevrouw van de zee op bezoek komen die zijn heel deskundig en erg ge nteresseerd in zon verzameling op jouw lijst zag ik ook haar naam staan en uit politiestandpunt gezien is dat ook terecht maar waarom dan niet de naam van haar dochter of haar schoonzoon of van de verzekeringsman die de boel verzekerd heeft of collegas van hem die getipt zouden kunnen zijn of de meteropnemer kan onder al deze mensen niet de dader schuilen of zou er misschien een medeplichtige zijn en misschien ben ik nog wel niet eens helemaal compleet
7308056 puike redenering kees je laat zien dat je wat van ons vak afweet maar mijn antwoord is toch zit de dader in die kennissenkring want hoe zouden de door jou genoemde personen in staat zijn geweest een afdruk van die kluissleutel te maken mevrouw van de zee is bij de mensen toch altijd lijfelijk aanwezig geweest nee kijk ik teken binnen dat laatste blauwe cirkeltje nog een kleiner groen cirkeltje en dat is cirkel van de potenti le daders jouw verkorte lijst dus dat zijn allemaal mensen die op een of andere manier lang genoeg in huis zijn geweest om een afdruk van de kluissleutel te maken en het nummer van de andere sleutel te noteren zie jij dat de meteropnemer doen nee h ik denk zelfs dat degene die een wasafdruk van de kluissleutel gemaakt heeft een zo vertrouwde kennis is dat die rustig een poosje alleen in de kamer kon blijven
7308057 ja in theorie wel maar die jongen komt zo hoogst zelden bij zijn schoonmoeder dat ik die als dader uitsluit kijk je nu die lijst even door
7308058 nog even wat anders dick hoe weet je zo zeker dat er een wasafdruk gemaakt is ik heb weleens gelezen over duplicaatsleutels die al bij de brandkastenfabrikant werden vervaardigd
7308059 ja maar die zijn dan niet van de echte te onderscheiden en deze was toch echt namaak althans volgens onze deskundige
7308060 nou ik denk dat dat groene cirkeltje maar heel klein wordt want ik zie er toch maar een enkeling bij die fysiek in staat zou zijn om die buit weg te slepen toevallig weet ik omdat ik bij die verzekeringsgesprekken geweest ben om welk gewicht het hier gaat vooral vanwege die munten je kunt de meeste vrouwen wel vergeten goed ik heb hier de namen voor je maar strikt onder ons en denk er goed aan dat ik geen enkele persoon beschuldig ik probeer alleen de namen over te houden op grond van jouw theorie en bedenk dan ook ik geloof zelf beslist niet in die theorie
7308061 ja dat zeg je nu wel maar je hebt zelf het woord medeplichtige laten vallen is het nu zo gek dat een vrouw de wasafdruk maakt en haar man zoon of vriend de eigenlijke inbraak laat uitvoeren
7308062 het is allemaal mogelijk maar ik denk dat je beter kunt beginnen met de alibis van de mannen
7308063 je hebt je eigen naam ook laten staan zie ik
7308064 ja natuurlijk maar ook weer alleen omdat ik in jouw eliminatiemethode pas je vergeet naar mijn gevoel iets maar ik weet nog niet precies wat
7308065 ja goed en laat mij intussen de zaak nog eens overdenken dan kom ik misschien op dat hiaat
7308066 tja ik moet aannemen tussen 09 30 en 24 00 uur want ik denk niet dat het s nachts gebeurd is het was s nachts nog veel gemener weer dan s avonds nee ik denk s avonds
7308067 het was inderdaad de hele dag al vreselijk slecht weer zijn er die dag geen schaatsenrijders uit de bus gestapt zoals anders altijd gebeurt
7308068 ik heb navraag gedaan in dat caf want daar komen ze vaak een kop erwtensoep eten maar er was die dag geen enkele vreemdeling geweest behalve een dame die met de bus van 12 15 uur arriveerde en die toen bleek dat ze toch geen tocht kon maken even het dorp is ingelopen maar ze hebben haar niet meer zien vertrekken
7308069 nou ik vraag me nog af of je toch niet fout zit met je autochtonen theorie want ik heb je nu wel via je lijst een paar potenti le daders aangegeven maar ik zou er niet n van op kunnen noemen die ik er echt toe in staat acht
7308070 maar als die dame het dan gedaan heeft hoe komt die dan aan de sleutels
7308071 ja hoor eens dick jij bent de politieman maar je moet er natuurlijk wel tegen kunnen als je klankbord een andere echo laat horen dan jij hoopte en verwachtte en wat die sleutel betreft die kan toch wel veel eerder gemaakt zijn ik heb er geen verstand van maar het lijkt mij een fluitje van een cent ze kunnen toch best hun kans hebben gegrepen als mevrouw van de zee bijvoorbeeld even naar het toilet was
7308072 nou dick we moeten er maar een eind aan maken maar ik sta op de lijst zou je mij niet meteen een alibiverhoor afnemen dan is het maar gebeurd
7308073 mooi je bent ongehuwd h wanneer ga je nu eens trouwen je bent er mijns inziens toch het type voor om een gezinnetje te stichten maar dan moet je nu wel een beetje opschieten nou verdachte
7308074 ik zal het precies vertellen ik denk dat mijn agenda mij wel een beetje kan helpen het gebeurde op donderdag 13 februari niet ik heb die dag op kantoor gezeten tot ongeveer 21 00 uur door dat beestenweer ben ik er in geslaagd om mijn administratie weer een beetje bij te werken mijn tijden van aankomst en vertrek kun je controleren aan de hand van mijn prikkaart wij hebben namelijk de gewoonte en de plicht om van hoog tot laag van directeur tot jongste bediende onze aankomst en vertrektijden op de prikkaart vast te leggen iedereen moet klokken en dat komt nu weer goed uit ik ben misschien dat weet ik niet zo goed meer even gaan lunchen maar ook dat is op mijn kaart terug te vinden volgens jou is de inbraak gepleegd tussen 09 30 en 24 00 uur de tijd dat mevrouw van de zee niet thuis was dus je moet van mij dus het laatste stuk nog weten even nadenken ik kwam thuis toen moeder naar een radiohoorspel zat te luisteren dat zij beslist niet wil missen ik heb haar begroet en ben toen mijn post gaan doorwerken o ja ik heb nog gebeld met de zaak dat staat op de band zodat de tijd te controleren is daarna heb ik met moeder koffie gedronken wat gebabbeld en om ongeveer 12 00 uur ben ik naar bed gegaan eigenlijk een te mooi sluitend verhaal h dick maar ik heb geen zwakker
7308075 het is maar een formaliteit wat ik je nog vragen wilde jij wilt niet dat je dorpsgenoten over ons gesprek horen mag ik op mijn beurt jou ook vragen tegenover anderen niets over ons gesprek te vertellen ik ben natuurlijk op een ongebruikelijke manier bezig waar ik mijn superieuren graag nog even buiten wil houden
7308076 maar mag ik nu intussen wat schrijven over die zaak
7308077 ja maar doe me een lol en houd het toch wat in het vage en noem geen details zoals wij vandaag bespraken ik wil eerst die alibi interviews afwerken ik geef je wel een seintje als je je gang kunt gaan

7308088 ik bedoel voorlopig niks ik vraag alleen of u ge nteresseerd bent
7308089 nou kom mijnheer wallis van w niet grappig worden tussen twee haakjes hebt u de bandrecorder al ingeschakeld mooi zo flink zo grote jongen nu ter zake als u die gestolen verzameling geheel compleet wilt hebben niet tegen de door u uitgeloofde beloning van fl 50 000 maar voor het dubbele een ton dus dan plaatst u zaterdag in de telegraaf in de pagina met kleine annonces de volgende advertentie noteert u even brabantse betsy akkoord w w hebt u dat nou tot horens dan eh w w
7308090 nou graag hoor en laten we nou maar een sherrytje gaan nemen
7308091 eh eh eh stop niks sherry je gaat nu heel gewoon naar huis geen risico weet je wel ik breng je vanavond wel een hele doos sherry dan kun je net zoveel drinken als je maar wilt dag meid bedankt en nogmaals het was klasse
7308092 wat een prachtmeid die zuster van mij ik zal wel nooit trouwen omdat ik ze allemaal met haar vergelijk
7308093 meneer ik heb hier een dame aan de telefoon die u spreken wil maar haar naam niet wil zeggen wilt u haar spreken
7308094 dan heb ik de juiste man denk ik dag meneer ik wilde u vragen bent u de journalist die altijd die verslagen van rechtszittingen schrijft
7308095 ja dat is onder andere mijn taak maar wat wilt u daarmee
7308096 even wachten jonge vriend ik heb nog een vraag hebt u ook die serie artikelen geschreven over die grote eh postzegelinbraak zal ik het maar noemen in slootwetering
7308097 ook dat is juist maar wat betekenen die vragen en v r alles wie bent u
7308098 nu noem mij maar brabantse betsy en als ik u een advies mag geven schakel de bandrecorder maar in want het kon wel eens interessant worden wat ik u te melden heb
7308099 die stond al ingeschakeld maar ik brand van nieuwsgierigheid om te horen wat u nu eigenlijk wilt
7308100 ok jonge vriend daar gaan we en luister goed ik heb die hele postzegel en muntenverzameling in mijn bezit ik heb gistermiddag gebeld met de heer wallis van weerdenburgh wat een naam h ik noem hem net als zijn vrienden maar w w al zal hij van die wet nooit gebruik hoeven te maken de heer w w is zoals u vast wel weet directeur van varia v r de naam van de verzekeringsmaatschappij die ik uit n van uw artikelen heb opgepikt tussen twee haakjes ik ben geen abonnee van uw krant ik koop alleen losse nummers dat zeg ik om te voorkomen dat die goocheme inspecteur uw gehele klantenbestand gaat doorspitten goed ter zake ik heb w w een voorstel gedaan om die gestolen spullen weer in zijn bezit te krijgen ik heb hem voorgesteld in plaats van de gepubliceerde fl 50 000 een ton te betalen dan krijgt hij de handel ongeschonden en compleet terug wat vindt u daarvan
7308101 nou ik vind het prima maar wat heb ik daar verder mee te maken
7308102 dat zal ik u vertellen jonge vriend ik heb een tussenpersoon nodig die de ruil tussen poen en postzegels de p p ruil zogezegd regelt ik heb aan u gedacht en de vraag is of u er wat voor voelt
7308103 nou ik ben even sprakeloos en als ik nu snel reageer dan zeg ik al bij voorbaat dat ik mij aan geen enkele onwettige handeling schuldig kan maken
7308104 duidelijk knul maar dat hoeft ook niet kijk als w w zegt dat hij die ton er voor over heeft om een verzameling van twee ton terug te krijgen en u zorgt voor de ruil dan gebeurt er toch niets onwettigs
7308105 oh om allerlei redenen ik ga trouwens van dat stomme u af en ga verder jij jouwen ik vind dat je boeiend schrijft over misdaad je bent niet zon hoe noemen de duitsers dat oh ja je bent niet zon prinzipienreiter dat je je helemaal niet met misdadige elementen wilt afgeven kortom je kent die zelfkant ook erg goed verder je woont als ik goed ge nformeerd ben en dat ben ik zelf in slootwetering waar die inbraak destijds nogal een sensatie was en tenslotte je krijgt een machtige primeur al moeten we als je ja zegt nog wel een paar dingen over die publiciteit afspreken die primeur is jouw beloning lekker goedkoop voor mij nietwaar
7308106 nou ja nogmaals u overvalt me wel een beetje boel en ik zeg u eerlijk dat ik er in eerste instantie weinig voor voel me in een wespennest te steken
7308107 goed ik wil het volgende met je afspreken details volgen eventueel later wel je zult natuurlijk en daar is niets tegen willen praten met je advocaat en met die inspecteur van politie uit amsterdam die destijds die zaak probeerde op te lossen hoe heet e ook weer van rijn of zoiets
7308108 o ja van der waal ik wist dat het stroomde en nat was die van der waal denkt waarschijnlijk een kans te krijgen die zaak die hem geloof ik nogal hoog zat tenslotte toch nog op te lossen en als w w tenminste dat hoop ik zijn verlies alsnog een beetje wil goedmaken dan wil ik het volgende met je afspreken je plaatst zaterdag in je eigen krant in de rubriek diversen bij de kleine annonces ik ken die krant goed niet waar de volgende advertentie brabantse betsy ok v r zon soort tekst plaatst ook w w maar dan in de telegraaf worden die geplaatst dan hoor je nader van mij zo niet dan weet ik dat het feest niet doorgaat ik moet dan wat anders verzinnen en het enige wat jij eraan over hebt gehouden is een grappig bandje dag knul ik hoop tot spoedig hou doe
7308109 nou dat zul je wel zien het gaat over die inbraak in slootwetering ik heb een gesprek op de band staan dat je beslist horen moet kom maar hier naar toe dan lunchen we samen als we klaar zijn
7308110 aha de politieman nou ik kan je helpen het was precies 11 00 uur toen het gesprek misschien een minuutje liep maar wat heb je daaraan
7308111 dat weet ik niet het is zoals je zegt de politieman verzamelt graag alle mogelijke gegevens maar laat nu dat bandje maar horen ik ben razend benieuwd
7308112 dat is me er eentje zeg wat een brutaal nest hoe oud denk je dat zij is
7308113 daar heb ik ook al over nagedacht maar ik denk ouder dan twintig jonger dan dertig
7308114 zal ik het nog eens draaien dan maak ik gelijk een kopie voor je
7308115 ja nou de conclusie is voorlopig dat er weer beweging in die hopeloos vastgelopen zaak komt en daar ben ik blij mee
7308116 ja dat snap ik maar ik voel voorlopig niets voor de rol die mij toegedacht wordt er zijn teveel vragen word ik nu medeplichtig ben ik strafbaar accepteert varia v r het aanbod zo ja gaan zij akkoord met mijn rol in die affaire en hoe vertel je dat je lezers zonder de indruk te geven dat je inderdaad met de dieven onder n hoedje speelt nee ik ben geneigd om te zeggen neem voor mij maar een ander miss tilburg
7308117 maar van dat vragenlijstje van je zijn er in eerste instantie twee belangrijk ten eerste ben je in juridische zin in overtreding door als tussenpersoon op te treden dat geloof ik niet maar daar kunnen we natuurlijk juridisch advies over inwinnen en ten tweede wat zegt de verzekeringsmaatschappij dat weten wij al snel als ik even van je telefoon gebruik mag maken
7308118 het is natuurlijk wel een beetje kort dag kunnen wij nu alvast afspreken dat wij de zaak morgenochtend zullen bespreken
7308119 verwacht ik u om 10 00 uur te mijnen kantore
7308120 zal ik je dan zeggen wat je dwars zit jij vraagt je af of het nu niet wat al te toevallig begint te worden dat kees van rietschoten nu weer bij de zaak betrokken is of vergis ik mij
7308121 ja wat moet ik daar nu van zeggen ik heb natuurlijk geen enkele verdenking tegen jou persoonlijk stel je voor maar ik word nu toch weer opnieuw gesterkt in mijn oorspronkelijke idee dat de daders niet zo ver van slootwetering moeten worden gezocht ze lezen jouw krant al beweren ze daar niet op geabonneerd te zijn ze zoeken jou als inwoner van slootwetering uit voor de rol van tussenpersoon kortom alles wijst erop dat ze jou kennen
7308122 maar dat brabantse grietje dan ik heb geen flauw idee wie dat is
7308123 nee die kan ik ook niet plaatsen zeg jij hebt nogal een talenknobbel denk jij dat het origineel brabants is of een spraakje dat aangeleerd is
7308124 nou ik denk dat het origineel is en wel uit de buurt van tilburg je weet natuurlijk dat er ook in brabant tientallen dialecten en tongvallen zijn ik herken hier iets tilburgs in omdat ik toevallig een relatie in de drukkerswereld heb die precies zo praat maar nogmaals ik ken geen enkel meisje dat zon dialect spreekt
7308125 maar hoe gaan we nu verder ik zou toch erg graag willen dat je die rol van tussenpersoon op je neemt en dat je dus morgenochtend mee gaat naar varia v r ik zal onze jurist inschakelen en als jij dat nu ook doet dan komen wij misschien tot een besluit kijk je zou mij er echt mee helpen want je mag gerust weten dat de zaak mij nog steeds behoorlijk hoog zit en als jij weigert dan moet ik maar weer afwachten of ze nog met een andere figuur komen opdraven
7308126 alles tot je dienst dick ik wil je best helpen maar pas als het echt volkomen safe is voor gerechtelijke gevolgen en als ook varia v r mij acceptabel vindt want ik heb met die maatschappij nog altijd een wat gespannen verhouding ik zit dan nog wel met het probleem hoe ik zonder schade aan mijn image mijn rol aan mijn publiek kan verkopen maar daar vind ik samen met jan zwart misschien wel wat op
7308127 als dat zo is dan speel je het zo dat jij als het ware op verzoek van varia v r n met volledige goedkeuring van de politie die rol op je neemt wij moeten ervoor zorgen dat je direct notulen van de bespreking krijgt door alle partijen ondertekend dan ben je mijns inziens wel safe ik zal vanmiddag even proberen te achterhalen of er jurisprudentie is
7308128 kun je morgen mee naar die vergadering dan haal ik je wel van huis op
7308129 maar ik ben daar op aandringen van inspecteur van der waal zij het met veel moeite overheen gestapt
7308130 ik ben niet graag ergens waar ik niet welkom ben dus heren adieu
7308131 de heer van rietschoten wilde hier eigenlijk helemaal niet zijn voelde ook niets voor de rol die hij zou moeten spelen en is door mij met veel moeite overgehaald in ieder geval dit gesprek mee te maken waarin hij in overleg met zijn juridisch adviseur tevens zijn voorwaarden bekend zou maken als u mijnheer wallis van weerdenburgh nu zegt dat de heer van rietschoten eigenlijk niet welkom is dan had u mij dat gisteren moeten zeggen en moet u er nu niet op blijven doorhameren want dan kunnen we beter allemaal opstappen
7308132 nou ja zo bedoel ik het niet gaat u toch zitten mijnheer van rietschoten mijn excuus voor mijn uitval ik stel het op prijs als u ons in deze netelige zaak van dienst zou willen zijn
7308133 ten eerste ik wil de absolute zekerheid dat ik als ik die rol op mij neem niet als medeplichtige kan worden beschouwd ten tweede ik zal mij strikt neutraal opstellen en weiger dingen te doen als een soort onbezoldigd politieman om de daders erin te luizen en anderzijds zal ik natuurlijk ook aan de daders geen enkele hulp bieden dus nogmaals strikt neutraal ten derde ik wil als journalist absoluut de primeur van het hele gebeuren hebben al ben ik evenals tot nu toe gebeurd is graag bereid hierin overleg te plegen met de inspecteur dit is ook mijn enige beloning ik accepteer beslist geen fooien uit welke hoek dan ook ten vierde er komen van onze afspraken notulen direct na afloop van deze vergadering door alle partijen te ondertekenen ik ben van mening dat dit redelijke verlangens zijn mijnheer de voorzitter en geef graag het woord aan anderen
7308134 nu dat is duidelijk geformuleerd wie mag ik het woord geven
7308135 mijnheer de voorzitter ik heb deze zaak uiteraard al grondig met de heer van rietschoten besproken en wil graag van u of van mijn geachte confr re weten wie op dit ogenblik nu eigenlijk in juridische zin eigenaar is van de bewuste partij postzegels en munten ben u dat mijnheer wallis van weerdenburgh of althans varia v r
7308136 mag ik even mijnheer de voorzitter inderdaad geachte confr re dat is een belangrijk punt maar gelukkig is daar jurisprudentie over varia v r heeft aan mevrouw van de zee de verzekerde som uitbetaald en is daarmee juridisch eigenaar geworden
7308137 het doet mij genoegen dat u hiermee bevestigt wat ik gisteren ook al nageslagen had want dat vereenvoudigt de zaak in hoge mate ik denk dat in de notulen moet worden opgenomen dat varia v r als eigenaar van bedoelde partij postzegels en munten aan de heer van rietschoten het verzoek doet om namens haar alles te doen wat in zijn vermogen ligt om de ruil tussen de gevraagde som en de partij postzegels en munten tot stand te brengen bent u het daarmee eens
7308138 dat dit voldoende tegemoet komt aan het eerste punt van de heer van rietschoten
7308139 ja afhankelijk van de tekst van de notulen ben ik in principe akkoord
7308140 uw tweede punt was als ik het wel heb dat u een strikt neutrale houding wilt aannemen wel mijn eerste belang is ik wil dolgraag de gestolen spullen terug want als ik die weer onbeschadigd in handen krijg is mijn strop slechts 1 ton en niet de 2 ton die ik aan mevrouw van de zee heb uitbetaald de partij is inmiddels misschien zelfs nog wel meer waard ik zou daarmee al dik tevreden zijn maar als het mogelijk is om de daders te pakken op een zodanig tijdstip dat ik n de partij n het losgeld terugkrijg dan is mij dat natuurlijk nog veel liever maar wat heeft de inspecteur daar op te zeggen
7308141 dat is nu juist de reden waarom ik deze mogelijkheid om een geheel vastgelopen zaak weer in beweging te krijgen bij mijn superieuren zo fel heb verdedigd uw eerste belang is inderdaad die gestolen partij terug te krijgen het mijne het grijpen van de daders ik mag en dat realiseer ik mij terdege geen dingen ondernemen die uw belangen in gevaar brengen maar ik heb er alles voor over om beide doelstellingen te combineren
7308142 maar hoe zie je mijn rol want dat is dan weer mijn primaire belang
7308143 nou ik ken je ik weet dat ik je niet kan overhalen met mij mee te werken dus ik kan jou alleen vragen alles door te geven wat je weet en hoort bijvoorbeeld waar de ruil zal plaatsvinden op welke dag en hoe laat enzovoort
7308144 goed maar ik wil tegenover de andere partij ook eerlijk zijn en werk dus beslist niet mee aan geheime zendertjes of met chemische middelen bewerkte bankbiljetten of andere trucjes begrijp mij goed als je in het belang van jouw werk in deze affaire toch zoiets moet ondernemen dan is dat natuurlijk je goed recht maar ik wil het dan niet weten ok
7308145 maar dat leggen we ook in de notulen vast nietwaar
7308146 welnu dan rest mij nog punt 3 van de verlangens van de heer van rietschoten als ik het wel heb
7308147 ik heb vaker met de heer van rietschoten te maken gehad en op dit punt hebben wij altijd een uitstekend overleg
7308148 maar voor alle duidelijkheid ik wil niet dat op de dag van de ruil of een dag later in de telegraaf of een ander blad een bericht verschijnt verstrekt door varia v r waarin wordt vermeld dat de transactie heeft plaatsgevonden nog los van de vraag of de daders wel of niet gepakt zijn
7308149 dan stel ik voor dat wij nu een drankje nemen op de goede afloop terwijl de heren rechtsgeleerden samen de notulen van deze wel zeer bijzondere vergadering opstellen met daarin feitelijk als hoofdzaak de wensen van de heer van rietschoten ik laat even een juffie komen voor de consumpties
7308150 dit is toch wel absolute einde zoals jij die knapen allemaal hebt ingepakt wat ben jij een uitgekookte smeerlap zeg
7308151 maar zonder jouw brabantse betsy optreden was het veel minder goed gegaan en je zult merken hoe ik je in de volgende fase nodig heb en nu ga ik slapen want ik ben moe van al dat geklets
7308152 zo en nu ria je volgende taak je post deze brief pak hem alsjeblieft met handschoenen uit het zakje en post hem in utrecht op het centraal station je rijdt daar met je auto heen en verzuipt onderweg de schrijfmachine in het amsterdam rijnkanaal je kunt dat gemakkelijk vinden er zijn stille plekjes zat maar kijk uit dat niemand je ziet ook niet van de overkant van het kanaal alles duidelijk
7308153 jij bent de baas broertje maar ik vind je wel een ontzaglijke keutel zeg
7308154 ja dat vond ik ook jij hebt nog niks gehoord
7308155 enfin er zit niks anders op dan af te wachten
7308156 maar je koopt die twee koffertjes en de tas in verschillende winkels in drie ver uit elkaar liggende plaatsen afmetingen van de koffers ongeveer 50 bij 40 bij 25
7308157 en waar dient dat allemaal voor als ik vragen mag
7308158 je mag vragen wat je wilt zussie ik wil die koffers gebruiken bij onze transactie maar hoe ik mij dat precies voorstel dat leg ik je later nog wel eens uit breng als je ze hebt die koffers en de tas naar mijn huis dan kunnen ze in de boterkelder zo noemen wij steevast onze bergplaats en breng dan volgende week onze verzameling ook over maar denk erom dat niemand er iets van ziet en ik ben daarom hartstikke blij dat je een garage hebt die vanuit je huis bereikbaar is
7308159 nou prima patroon ik zal uw wensen uitvoeren heb je wat geld voor me want ik heb geen flauw idee wat die dingen kosten en ik moet ook nodig tanken en ik denk dat u patroon liever niet hebt dat ik cheques gebruik
7308160 goed zo meissie je wordt nog een echte boevin hier pak aan je geld maar waar ga je ze kopen
7308161 ik geloof dat ik langzamerhand lijn in je plan zie je wilt een koffertje met geld ruilen voor het koffertje met de spullen h maar hoe je dat precies wilt organiseren weet ik nog niet
7308162 nou dat komt nog wel wij gaan nu eerst de hele boel weer uitpakken en grondig schoonmaken dan doen we de hele zwik weer in een grote papieren zak en laten die in de boterkelder zakken als we daarmee klaar zijn pakken we het tweede koffertje maken dat ook zorgvuldig schoon verpakken het in pakpapier dat ik hier in huis heb en thuis tik je op een label dat ik je zal meegeven mijn kantooradres met toevoeging strikt persoonlijk in handen van de heer van rietschoten ik vertrouw erop dat je geen enkele vingerafdruk op papier en label achterlaat dan ga je morgen in een vermomming die je onderweg op een stil plekje moet aanbrengen welke dat moet je zelf maar weten daar ben je een kei in nadat je opnieuw de hele buitenkant hebt schoongeveegd met handschoenen aan naar het hoofdpostkantoor in amsterdam je weet wel waar dat is mooi daar vul je met verdraaide blokletters ook dat is je best toevertrouwd en nog steeds met handschoenen aan mijn adres in en laat het pakket aan mij opsturen kijk goed uit dat ze je in patersdijck nooit in een vermomming zien hoor
7308163 nee ik weet wel beter maar ik waarschuw alleen nog maar eens want het moet feilloos gebeuren in ieder geval raak je voor je terugkomt onderweg die vermomming wel weer kwijt en je rijdt patersdijck weer binnen zoals je vertrokken bent namelijk als de oerdegelijke juf van rietschoten van de school met den bijbel gesnopen dit alles herhaal het dan even wil je
7308164 puik meid maar nu nog wat wil je vanavond aan mijn kantooradres een briefje sturen ik geeft je zo de inhoud op
7308165 nou dick er is nog meer aan de hand ik heb intussen ook een brief ontvangen waaruit ik opmaak dat er in dit pakket inderdaad een koffer zit wat doen we eerst
7308166 laat mij eerst de brief maar lezen heb je tussen twee haakjes de envelop nog
7308167 ik zal eens kijken stom van mij zeg ja hier heb ik hem maar natuurlijk wel volgevingerd en de brief zal ook wel niet helemaal koosjer zijn maar er stond op de envelop geen afzender dus ik wist niet dat het een brief van miss tilburg was maar het pakketje heb ik niet geopend zoals je ziet
7308168 ik wil graag voor mijn archief even een fotokopietje kan dat
7308169 maar laat sjors dat dan even doen anders komen er nog meer printen op
7308170 kees die kan ik zeker wel even meenemen voor een nader onderzoek
7308171 nee dick dat kun je niet je weet wat er in de notulen zwart op wit is afgesproken je hebt gelezen dat onze bets dat ook niet wil en daar houd ik mij voor 100 aan
7308172 dat doe je dan maar hier jouw assistent heeft alle attributen wel bij zich laat hem zijn gang maar gaan ik ben ervan overtuigd dat er niks te vinden is maar dat zoeken jullie zelf maar uit let wel als je wilt dat ik doorga met die zaak dan houd ik dat koffertje beslist onder mijn beheer
7308173 want ik mag niet te veel in de gaten lopen door steeds maar weer met mijn auto op pad te zijn ik heb al wat lesuren met collegas geruild en die kan ik dan mooi volgende week teruggeven
7308174 sorry kees ik was wat gespannen ik wil deze zaak dolgraag tot een goed einde brengen en die daders arresteren maar je hebt gelijk als je zegt dat je van tevoren hebt gesteld niets tegen onze methoden te hebben maar er niet aan te zullen meewerken
7308175 nou ik snap het best zand erover ik ben helemaal niet op mijn teentjes getrapt kom een borrel bij mij thuis drinken dan kunnen wij de zaken nog even op een rijtje zetten
7308176 doen we maar ik heb het erg druk dus de afspraak maak ik nog wel tot kijk h
7308177 kijk ik haal op d day s morgens bij n van hun kantoren dat geld op ik zorg ervoor dat er een instructie van brabantse betsy komt aan mij gericht waarin zij de samenstelling in coupures van die ton geeft en mij nog eens waarschuwt voor het noteren van de nummers en het bewerken met chemische stoffen je begrijpt het is absoluut uitgesloten dat alle boerenleenbank kantoren geprepareerde bankbiljetten hebben klaarliggen immers zij kennen de wensen van de dieven over de samenstelling in coupures niet en zo bereik ik dat wij besteedbaar geld in onze handjes krijgen
7308178 wat een infame doortrapte schurk ben jij heb je dat allemaal bij de rechtbank geleerd t is fraai hoor
7308179 nou tik jij die brief even dan maken wij hem weer keurig schoon en post ik hem morgen maar eens in hoorn
7308180 kees luister nou weer eens varia v r heeft van die brabantse trut een brief gekregen ik heb op mij genomen jou in te lichten ik zal hem voorlezen
7308181 t is g v d zo uitgekookt als ik van mijn leven nog niet heb meegemaakt en wat moet ik nou jij wilt neutraal blijven dus ik hoef jou niet te vragen mij te helpen dus sta ik mooi met mijn rug tegen de muur g v d
7308182 ho broeder niet zo vloeken dat help toch niks ik weet maar n antwoord kun je geen contact krijgen bijvoorbeeld via een advertentie in de telegraaf gericht aan brabantse betsy die lezen ze natuurlijk met het oog op die verwachte advertentie van w w als je haar nu vraagt contact met je op te nemen misschien kun je haar voorstellen een andere tussenpersoon te accepteren en misschien is die niet zo keutelig neutraal als ik ik wil nog altijd dolgraag van het klussie af
7308183 nou nee dat doen ze toch niet ze willen jou nu eenmaal
7308184 je kunt het toch proberen nee heb je al je kunt in ieder geval kijken of ze reageren en hoe ze reageren
7308185 daar moet ik nog over nadenken ik zal wallis even bellen over dat idee maar ik denk dat die liever geen extra risico zal willen nemen in ieder geval bedankt en sorry voor de vloeken in het oor van zon christelijk opgevoed ventje tussen twee haakjes ik heb nog een borrel van je tegoed zullen wij dat vanavond maar doen
7308186 mijnheer van rietschoten ik hoorde van inspecteur van der waal dat u zich wilde terugtrekken uit die postzegelaffaire is dat juist
7308187 ja de inspecteur was razend over die laatste brief want alle trucs die hij in petto had om via de ruil de daders te grijpen werden hem ontnomen omdat ik er nu eenmaal en u weet dat geen medewerking aan wil verlenen dus zei ik zoek een ander
7308188 maar mijnheer van rietschoten dat wil ik helemaal niet natuurlijk wil ik ook graag de daders maar allereerst wil ik mijn zegels en munten terug dat kost mij dan misschien een ton maar de waardevermeerdering van de verzamelingen is ook niet gering dan maar geen daders ik heb trouwens de gevraagde advertentie al aan de telegraaf opgegeven
7308189 ik heb gisteravond met van der waal een borrel gedronken hij was alweer wat gekalmeerd
7308190 ik denk dat hij als enige kans nog zal proberen bij de ruil op eigen kracht in te grijpen door het inzetten van zoveel mogelijk politiepersoneel en dat is natuurlijk zijn goed recht
7308191 nou ik weet nu hoe u erover denkt en dat sluit helemaal aan op mijn idee n als u van der waal nog even wilt bellen dan houden wij het maar bij de gemaakte afspraken
7308192 fijn bedankt ik zal u een dezer dagen een cheque sturen ik moet alleen nog even wachten op die brief van de boerenleenbank directie aan hun kantoren graag tot ziens mijnheer van rietschoten
7308193 geen zorgen meisje geloof maar gerust dat je oudste en tevens jongste broer zo voorzichtig manoeuvreert alsof hij op eieren loopt en ik weet hoogmoed komt voor de val goed en nu weer ter zake wij moeten nu een datum prikken waarop de vis wordt binnengehaald h grappig dat ik dat zeg want de hele zaak is begonnen met het binnenhalen van een vis achter het huis van coby wat denk je van maandag de tiende schikt dat
7308194 ja dat lukt wel maar dat is pas over 3 weken waarom dat
7308195 dat zal ik je vertellen je gaat aanstaande maandag naar utrecht licht vermomd maar liefst op een parkeerplaats aan te brengen zodat ze je in patersdijck alleen maar naturel zien en koopt dan op het kantoor van de nederlandse spoorwegen een retourbiljet eerste klas tilburg gedateerd op de tiende je wagen moet je niet in de parkeergarage zetten maar in het straatje v r die garage dat mag er zijn parkeermeters dus steek kleingeld bij je dan loop je de parkeergarage in en gaat met lift naar het restaurant in het winkelcentrum als je uit de lift stapt zie je dat de receptioniste telefoniste recht tegenover de lift zit rechts naast de liftdeur zit het toetsenbord voor de tages a t m d en een knop met een kruis erop die moet je goed in je geheugen prenten want die gaat in mijn plan een grote rol spelen ik wil graag dat je dat allemaal op maandag doet zodat de situatie zoveel mogelijk vergelijkbaar is met maandag de tiende wat zeg je overdreven ja dat is zo maar tot nog toe voel ik mij er prima bij ik wil graag dat je exact de tijd opneemt die je nodig hebt om vanuit de parkeergarage bij de receptie te komen ik weet wel dat kan wel eens verschillen omdat er de ene keer meer passagiers zijn dan de andere keer maar maandagmorgen is het altijd heel erg rustig omdat er veel winkels gesloten zijn neem maar wat tijden op op je horloge we werken dat later wel uit o ja wil je ook nog even de plaatsen waar de telefooncellen zich bevinden in het winkelcentrum in je opnemen en wil je het telefoonnummer van het restaurant opzoeken nou dat was een heel verhaal kun je het even herhalen
7308196 dat hoor jij als hoofdrolspeelster natuurlijk bijtijds en precies maar niet nu herhaal je het even
7308197 mooi dat kost niet veel tijd zie ik heb je die kruisknop gezien
7308198 ja en ik weet ook waar die voor dient de lift wordt ook als goederenlift gebruikt en je kunt hem daarmee vastzetten h
7308199 precies en dat is nu exact wat jij de tiende gaat doen heb je ook naar die telefooncellen gekeken en het nummer van het restaurant opgezocht
7308200 ja natuurlijk dat is toch de afspraak je tegenstander weet heus wel dat ik dit aan je doorgeven zal
7308201 de moeite van vingerafdrukken nemen zal ik maar achterwege laten daar zijn deze geraffineerde spitsboeven toch veel te slim voor
7308202 daar kan ik niet intrappen leuk geprobeerd maar je weet t zo langzamerhand wel h
7308203 nou laat maar ik had niet anders verwacht heb jij enig idee hoe ze dat nu in een trein willen flikken ze begrijpen toch wel dat het minste dat ik kan doen is om een heel stel van mijn mensen tussen de passagiers te mengen of zouden ze die trein ergens tot stilstand willen brengen bij een viaduct waar een verkeersweg langs of onderdoor loopt
7308204 luister dick jij bent de politieman ik heb geen flauw idee maar ik ben wel razend nieuwsgierig natuurlijk dit wordt een moordverhaal voor mijn krant
7308205 ik ga maar weer eens naar amsterdam ik moet nog een boel organiseren v r maandagochtend bedankt kees en tot maandag ik zie je vast nog wel en o ja dat vergat ik haast mochten er kinken in kabels komen je weet maar nooit ik ben maandagochtend stand by in de politiepost in het winkelcentrum telefoon 611611
7308206 allereerst de koffer met het spul in de boodschappentas kijk ria wij mogen niet de fout maken met zon opvallende koffer door het winkelcentrum te sjouwen er zullen wel genoeg mannen en vrouwen van dick van der waal rondlopen maar dames met boodschappentassen lopen er natuurlijk honderden ik heb voor jou een kamer gereserveerd in een provincieplaats onder de rook van utrecht je krijgt direct het adres van mij ik heb gereserveerd op naam van mevrouw pieterse uit nijmegen ik wil graag dat je morgenavond in een vermomming waarin je absoluut onherkenbaar bent daar ben je goed in als het donker is daar naartoe rijdt met de stuff aan boord je mag in patersdijck natuurlijk niet gezien worden maar daar is in jouw straatje weinig kans op de tas gaat uiteraard mee naar je kamer en de volgende morgen ontbijt je in dezelfde vermomming je rijdt naar utrecht en parkeert je auto in dat jou bekende straatje dat langs de parkeergarage loopt en gaat eerst naar het restaurant je zorgt daar om ca 10 00 uur aan te komen wil je dit verhaal even herhalen
7308207 in utrecht overtuig je je er eerst van dat ik in het restaurant zit met mijn koffer met een ton naast mij ik beledig je met te zeggen dat je bij de hele operatie handschoenen moet dragen maar ik zeg het toch ik heb je gevraagd het telefoonnummer van het restaurant op te zoeken
7308208 goed fantastisch zelfs er is en ook dat heb je uitgevlooid vlak bij de liftingang op de parterre dus direct naast de parkeergarage een telefooncel kwartjes bij je steken dus je wacht even een zo rustig mogelijk moment af belt dan het restaurant en vraagt naar de heer van rietschoten ik word dan door de receptioniste telefoniste opgeroepen jij laat de hoorn naast het toestel liggen en komt als de gesmeerde bliksem met de lift naar boven als je uit de lift stapt zie je mij bezig met hallo roepen in die telefoonbox naast de balie als alles ok is krijg je van mij een klein knikje je drukt de kruisknop in loopt naar de telefoon ritst je boodschappentas open en zegt
7308209 dag meneerke is d de koffer die ik voor mijn baos haolen moet t gaat een bietje anders dan t plan was maar allez
7308210 zet hem bij je voeten neer en doe de jouwe snel in mijn boodschappentas ik knik vriendelijk naar de receptioniste die er waarschijnlijk een beetje onge nteresseerd bij zit druk de kruisknop weer in druk dan snel op de knop naar de parterre en verdwijn als de weerga met de buit wel da moe lukke
7308211 ik sta echt perplex ria dat is exact wat ik wil jouw acteertalent je vermomming je dialect perfect allemaal maar je rijdt niet naar huis maar naar een stil plekje langs n of ander diep water waar je de tweede schrijfmachine die je vanavond in de kofferbak doet zwemmen gaat leren en op dat zelfde stille plekje doe je je vermomming af en laat die ook naar de bodem zakken als je een vuilniszak meeneemt dan kun je de schrijfmachine mooi als verzwaring gebruiken maar denk er om alles ongezien en zonder vingertjes h je komt dan maandagmiddag weer als juf van rietschoten patersdijck binnenrijden en laat de buit in jouw schuilhoekje zakken nog herhalen of is alles duidelijk
7308212 alles duidelijk maar mag ik vanmiddag nog een kopje koffie gaan drinken in dat restaurant ik zorg er natuurlijk voor op geen enkele manier in de gaten te lopen maar ik voel mij wat veiliger als ik de boel nog even kan verkennen ik zorg voor vermomming maar natuurlijk niet die ik zondag en maandag ga gebruiken
7308213 nou ik heb geen bezwaar maar doe voorzichtig want ik denk dat dick van der waal wel de hele dag in dat winkelcentrum loopt te ijsberen want hij is knap zenuwachtig hij kent jou en het zou dodelijk zijn voor ons plan als hij je herkende en een snelle combinatie zou maken
7308214 ik zal wel voorzichtig zijn maar het is ook meer zenuwtjes afreageren dan dat het voor ons programma nodig is want dat zit er geheid in
7308215 ok kun je nu nog even een brief opnemen en dat is dan de laatste in de hele affaire hoop ik
7308216 dat word je wel duidelijk als je de inhoud kent hij is gericht aan mij op mijn kantooradres en wordt door jou met de hand geschreven natuurlijk in een onherkenbaar handschrift allemaal blokhoofdletters dat is het veiligste
7308217 uw opdracht wordt aanvaard hoogheid dus vooruit met de geit ik ben bar nieuwsgierig
7308218 deze brief lieve zus breng ik persoonlijk naar frankfurt ik plak er duitse postzegels op en hoop hiermee de mist helemaal ondoordringbaar te maken gesnopen
7308219 wat zou er toch van jou terecht gekomen zijn als je in een ander milieu geboren was zeg
7308220 laten we maar gaan slapen want het zijn een paar spannende dagen die ons wachten
7308221 telefoon voor de heer van rietschoten de heer van rietschoten telefoon
7308222 wilt u direct 611611 bellen en inspecteur van der waal vragen hierheen te komen wilt u dit koffertje even voor mij bewaren ik moet proberen die oude dame te achterhalen belt u vlug het gaat om een groot bedrag dus 611611 inspecteur van der waal direct naar de balie van het restaurant
7308223 de uitgang afsluiten bent u nou helemaal waarvoor dan wel
7308224 ja dat kan ik niet zo snel uitleggen ik ga de politie waarschuwen
7308225 nee dat moet jij maar doen ik kreeg dat niet voor elkaar bij die wacht
7308226 ho dick dat gaat zo maar niet dat koffertje met inhoud is van varia v r dat weet je donders goed je mag het gerust meenemen maar eerst moet wallis van weerdenburgh daar toestemming voor geven ik zal hem meteen bellen
7308227 nou om je de waarheid te zeggen ik had je wel kunnen vermoorden maar ja het leven gaat door en ik heb die juffrouw van de receptie wel twintig keer laten vertellen hoe het precies in zijn werk was gegaan en ik moet zeggen dat ik achteraf wel begrijp dat jij er ook weinig aan kon veranderen en zo denkt trouwens ook de commissaris erover dus zand erover kom je een borrel drinken
7308228 nee kom jij maar hier naar toe want ik heb weer een brief gekregen van die lui
7308229 w t nou weer een brief wat moeten ze nou weer
7308230 kom maar hier naar toe dan drinken en eten we wat samen
7308231 nou ik zal kijken of met deze laatste stunt die knaap te ver is gegaan en ik zal laten onderzoeken of zon koppel al eerder geregistreerd is maar gezien de ervaringen heb ik daar weinig hoop op hij is aan jou gericht mag ik hem meenemen
7308232 ga je gang ik heb al een kopie gemaakt voor mijn archief want ik had de hele boel toch al zo vol gevingerd omdat er geen afzender op stond
7308233 maar aan de andere kant blijf ik zitten met de vraag hoe komen wij zo goed slecht als je begrijpt wat ik bedoel
7308234 wij hadden het er al eerder over ria aan onze ouders en onze opvoeding ligt dat beslist niet dus is er een andere oorzaak en die ligt toch wel in de genen verborgen toevallig is die slechte eigenschap van ons mogelijk toch door milieu of misschien door de oorlog be nvloed of misschien door enfin schwamm dr ber ik heb er in ieder geval geen hartzeer van en jij ook niet zo te zien geef me nog een borrel dan gaan we eens praten over de besteding van onze gestolen poen
7308235 ik heb er toch nog wat dieper over nagedacht eigenlijk vind ik en ik denk ook jij de grootste voldoening in de overwinning wij hebben onze intelligentie gemeten met anderen en we hebben gewonnen dat geeft mij veel meer voldoening dan die hele buit en het gekke is dat ik bij de hele operatie er nooit aan gedacht heb wat de consequenties zouden zijn geweest als we een fout hadden gemaakt en van der waal ons gepakt had geen seconde alleen de uitdaging telde t moest en zou lukken
7308236 nou meid dat geeft precies weer hoe ik erover denk dit is een heel goed evaluatiegesprek zoals ze dat tegenwoordig noemen maar waar blijf je met je borrel
7308237 nou ik ben de kerk al zo ontwend dat ook ik er echt niet als berouwvolle zondaar binnen zou stappen bovendien ik heb een heel goed geweten maar ik dank dat vooral aan mijn slechte geheugen
7308238 nou dan laten we het daar verder maar bij heb jij al een idee over de besteding van ons kapitaal
7308239 om te beginnen wij wachten nog even met uitgeven zo hard zitten we er niet om te springen ik bedoel we gaan nu niet meteen dure autos kopen of andere dure uitgaven doen
7308240 zeg wat krijgen we nou mag ik zeg je je bent in je eigen huis en het geld is evengoed van jou als van mij dus kom op met je idee
7308241 ik zou een deel van het geld graag aan een liefdadig doel schenken maar ik weet dat jij een beetje gereserveerd staat tegenover al die goede doelen omdat je vindt dat er teveel aan de strijkstok blijft hangen nou komt hier elk jaar een schat van een oude pater jansen heet hij die zijn halve leven al werkt in de sloppenwijken van montevideo die is zo maar eens aan komen lopen en ik was direct onder de indruk van zoveel opoffering ken je hem
7308242 ik heb al eens over hem gehoord van jou maar ik ken hem niet wat wil je met hem
7308243 nou daar heb je nou eens een goed doel waarvan je weet dat elke cent goed besteed wordt zou jij het gek vinden als we die man nou eens een fors bedrag schenken
7308244 kijk als je zoiets doet moet je het echt goed doen dus geen fooi maar in n keer echt goed
7308245 wat denk je van de helft van onze buit vijftigduizend gulden
7308246 meen je dat nou echt fantastisch geweldig o wat ben je toch een moordvent neem nog een borrel
7308247 wacht nog even ria kijk je kunt niet aan die pater even vijftig mille meegeven dat is om allerlei redenen veel te link hoe kom jij zo ineens aan vijftig mille en kan pater jansen zoveel geld meenemen en opbergen zonder het risico beroofd of zelfs vermoord te worden dus zowel voor hem als voor ons moeten de risicos worden vermeden hoe doe je dat
7308248 nou wat denk je hiervan ik stort elke maand een bedrag op zijn rekening in montevideo die rekening bestaat al want er zijn nog meer mensen in nederland die deze lieverd helpen dat wordt niet elke maand hetzelfde bedrag maar ik laat dat een beetje vari ren dan is het net of het van een collecte afkomstig is hij hoeft niet eens te weten dat ik dat geld stort want dat doe ik nu ook al anoniem het gaat om die stakkerds en niet om meerdere glorie van ons
7308249 perfect ria en als je vijftig mille op zijn zien we wel weer verder
7308250 o kees je komt als geroepen ik moet je nou wat vertellen je gelooft je oren niet ik zal even koffie zetten en als je dan een uurtje tijd voor me hebt dan ga ik je een verhaal doen dat je in deze tijd niet meer voor mogelijk zou houden
7308251 nou ik ben brandnieuwsgierig t gaat zeker over dat mooie grietje dat net bij je wegging
7308252 goed geraden maar nu eerst koffie ik ben er echt aan toe
7308253 dat meisje dat hier was is renate m ller de enige dochter van heinz m ller die op de laatste boerderij in de nonnenpolder woont ken je de geschiedenis van heinz m ller
7308254 die heinz m ller was een duitse soldaat die als n van de weinigen fel anti nazi was
7308255 die renate is een prachtmeid ze heeft in een bijzonder hoog tempo de middelbare school afgemaakt en in het najaar gaat zij studeren ik geloof internationaal recht of zoiets ze heeft een vriend een jongen uit onze stad uit een zeemansfamilie hij heet bert landman en studeert op de zeevaartschool daarmee een familietraditie voortzettend zoals ik al zei haar handen staan bepaald niet verkeerd en nu is zij om gedurende de zomer wat bij te verdienen als hulp in de huishouding werkzaam bij boer leblanc wiens vrouw thuis ernstig ziek ligt die pierre leblanc is de eigenaar van de gehele nonnenpolder boert zelf op n van de boerderijen en verpacht de vier overige waaronder dus die van renates ouders die leblanc nu is echt de grootste schoft die ik ooit van mijn leven ben tegengekomen het is een verschrikkelijke tiran met ik weet niet hoeveel functies in het kerkelijk en burgerleven ik zal er een paar opnoemen ouderling van de hervormde kerk hoe is het godsmogelijk voorzitter van de plaatselijke rabobank voorzitter van de co p graanmaalderij bestuurslid van de co p melk centrale bestuurslid van het productschap voor zuivel voorzitter van de gewestelijke pachtcommissie enzovoort enzovoort enzovoort hoe ik dat allemaal weet nou ja ik woon hier al heel wat jaren en in zon stadje als het onze weten de mensen vrijwel alles van elkaar mijnheer preekt godbetert ook s zondags nog weleens in naburige dorpen en doet zich dan voor als de vleesgeworden vroomheid maar als je hem ziet met die valse roodomrande gluiperige ogen hij kijkt je nooit rechtstreeks aan dan griezel je ervan niemand die het zou wagen om ook maar iets tegen hem te ondernemen want hij heeft een onaantastbare machtspositie en nu komt het kees
7308256 schenk eerst nog eens wat voor ons in want ik barst van nieuwsgierigheid en jij zult onderhand ook wel een droge keel hebben
7308257 over twee maanden loopt het pachtcontract tussen leblanc en heinz m ller af en nu heeft m ller een nieuw contract voorgelegd gekregen dat eenvoudig niet te geloven is de pachtprijs is vervijfvoudigd het contract kan door leblanc elk jaar worden opgezegd maar niet door m ller die daarmee dus praktisch levenslang de gevangene van leblanc wordt
7308258 maar de pachtcommissie die gaat daar toch niet mee akkoord
7308259 de pachtcommissie is leblanc zelf en zijn medebestuursleden zijn ook allemaal als de dood voor hem niet te geloven h maar t wordt nog erger hij heeft renate voorgesteld dat contract te vervangen door een normale overeenkomst als zij drie keer met hem naar bed gaat en dat arme kind durft hier niets van tegen die knul van haar te zeggen want die vermoordt hem die familie staat bekend als hardwerkende brave mensen maar driftig opvliegend en in zulke situaties tot alles in staat en ook haar ouders weten nog niets van dat schofterige voorstel haar vader is helemaal kapot haar moeder loopt de hele dag te huilen over zoveel onrecht in dat nieuwe contract nou zou je zeggen laat die vent doodvallen ze gaat daar gewoon niet meer naar toe en stapt naar de rechter maar in de eerste plaats wil zij vrouw leblanc aan wie ze bijzonder gehecht is niet in de steek laten en bovendien het is zijn woord tegen het hare en hij ontkent natuurlijk alles glashard zon smerige chanteur en nou komt ze met het verhaal bij haar oude juf en die weet ook zo gauw geen raad
7308260 nou wind je maar niet op ik zal je wel helpen hoe dat weet ik nog niet maar ik vind dit wel een uitdaging en dat wurgcontract zou pas over twee maanden ingaan dus we hebben nog wat tijd
7308261 ik hoop dat je een oplossing vindt maar in elk geval ben ik al erg blij dat ik je als klankbord heb mogen gebruiken
7308262 ja en ik heb haar verteld dat ik jou heb ingelicht en haar gezegd vooral rustig te blijven en vol te houden de schoft heeft haar al twee keer herinnerd aan zijn eis zij vertelde ook nog hoe vreselijk onaangenaam hij doet tegen zijn doodzieke vrouw ik denk dat hij haar maar een lastig blok aan zijn been vindt maar die zoon ook pierre geheten is een erg aardige jongen dat wist ik trouwens al want ik heb hem bij me in de klas gehad laatst was ik op bezoek bij een oude dame waarbij het gesprek kwam op de familie leblanc zij vertelde dat de vader van pierre leblanc een bijzonder prettige man was maar over diens vader gingen de meest onaangename verhalen vooral als het over vrouwen ging blijkbaar slaan zulke eigenschappen steeds een generatie over
7308263 maar nu zal ik je even vertellen wat ik de laatste dagen uitgebroed heb kijk die leblanc moeten we pakken op zijn achillespezen
7308264 nou kees ik heb met belangstelling zitten luisteren maar ik snap er nog geen bal van hier is je koffie en je glaasje
7308265 dank je nou kijk je weet dat leblanc altijd de collectes in de kerk voor zn rekening neemt en dat gebeurt nog op de ouderwetse manier met een zakje aan een stok ik heb met notaris de groot afgesproken dat die op een zondag naar de kerk in patersdijck gaat en daar het bewuste tientje in de collectezak laat verdwijnen het tellen van de buit
7308266 er moet in jou toch wel een bijzondere boef zitten zeg ongelooflijk hoe je dat uitgekiend hebt nou ja met boeven vang je boeven ik hoop dat je plan lukt want dan hebben we hem toch een beetje te pakken al zal er nog meer moeten gebeuren
7308267 ja precies en daarom zou ik wel eens kennis willen maken met meneer je kent uit ons streekblad vast wel de wekelijkse rubriek bekende streekgenoten op hun werkplek ik zal hem bellen en vragen of hij daar wat voor voelt hij is ijdel genoeg om dat wel te willen denk ik ik ga daar morgen mee beginnen verder heb ik nog meer plannetjes maar voor vanavond is het wel genoeg vind je ook niet
7308268 o k maar kom je dan morgenavond weer verslag doen en alvast hartstikke bedankt voor je medewerking ik popel van ongeduld om dat heerschap te pakken te nemen neem nog een borrel
7308269 nee dank je ik heb er al twee op tot morgen zus
7308270 dag meneer leblanc u spreekt met het streekblad kent u dat
7308271 nou eigenlijk niet ik lees alleen het reformatorisch dagblad maar ik zie dat krantje wel eens liggen want mijn vrouw is er op geabonneerd maar wat wilt u
7308272 wij zouden voor onze rubriek bekende streekgenoten op hun werkplek u graag eens willen interviewen voelt u daar wat voor
7308273 nou jammer dan niets aan te doen mocht u zich nog bedenken ons telefoonnummer vindt u bovenaan in de krant uw vrouw zal dat wel weten dag meneer leblanc
7308274 met leblanc ik had het met mijn vrouw over uw verzoek en die zou het graag willen
7308275 maar ik wil beslist eerst lezen wat u geschreven heeft v r het in de krant komt anders gaat het niet door
7308276 dan gaat het inderdaad niet door u moet er op vertrouwen dat wij in onze rubriek de mensen uitsluitend positief belichten maar wij kunnen niet alles eerst laten censureren
7308277 met leblanc mijn vrouw blijft maar doorzaniken hoe gaat het in zn werk
7308278 wel wij willen u graag s morgens op de boerderij aan het werk zien en maken van dat hele gebeuren een fotoreportage uiteraard krijgt u een complete set van ons
7308279 nou vooruit dan maar maar als u in het artikel verkeerde dingen over mij schrijft dan bent u nog niet met mij klaar
7308280 dat zal niet gebeuren en ik zou u willen voorstellen dat ik aanstaande woensdag s morgens om 7 uur met mijn fotograaf bij u aanbel
7308281 kijk ria het heeft enorme voordelen als je je vijand goed kent omdat je dan ook beter bent voorbereid op zijn zetten als ik hem alleen maar zou kennen uit jouw verslagen en andere van horen zeggens dan vind ik dat toch een beetje incompleet geen ramp natuurlijk maar om psychologische redenen sta ik graag eens lijfelijk tegenover hem
7308282 nee nee jij bent de baas ik ben jouw hulpkracht ik heb trouwens nog wat een kennis van mij is bestuurslid van de gewestelijke pachtcommissie in gelderland ik heb die contracten via renate in handen gekregen ik heb gebeld en hem zowel het bestaande pachtcontract als het nieuwe opgestuurd nadat ik eerst de namen eruit heb gehaald hij belde mij vanmorgen al terug en vroeg of ik soms een grap met hem uithaalde hij wilde eerst niet geloven dat het hier om echt feitelijke zaken ging hij stuurt mij zo spoedig mogelijk een voorbeeld op van een pachtcontract zoals dat er na de nodige periodieke indexeringen uit zou mogen zien dat leggen wij te zijner tijd als wij hem in de klem hebben aan hem voor ter ondertekening goed h
7308283 goed geweldig kees h ik begin er echt in te geloven
7308284 nou je kunt nog wat doen meneer gaat altijd op maandag naar de veemarkt in amsterdam heb je mij laatst verteld wat doet ie daar handelen of gaat hij soms zn seksuele lusten botvieren op de walletjes dat lijkt mij heel goed bij de figuur passen kun jij hem maandag schaduwen of durf je dat niet
7308285 geintje zus ik ken je al mijn hele leven lang
7308286 ik heb hier een paar fotos van hem overgenomen uit mijn krant toen hij de opening van het nieuwe bankgebouw in patersdijck verrichtte het kan nuttig zijn die bij je te steken ik heb nog iets gedaan waar je erg verbaasd over zult zijn ik heb in mijn eentje een stichting opgericht de stichting nemesis d w g
7308287 nou kees ik sta echt perplex jij ziet die hele aanpak blijkbaar voor je wie verzint nou zoiets en wat is nou precies de bedoeling
7308288 als mijn voorgevoel mij niet bedriegt krijg jij bij je spionage waarschijnlijk contact met een publieke vrouw om je rol goed te spelen is zon kaartje vaak erg nuttig en als je dan ook nog fotos van je slachtoffer bij je hebt dan heb jij genoeg stof om bewijzen van zijn bezoek aan te tonen kosten om zon vrouw om te kopen zijn onbegrensd want die verrekenen wij toch met hem
7308289 niks afspraak opdonderen en gauw anders maak ik de poort open
7308290 ik heb wel fantastisch fotomateriaal en ik denk dat je daar nog veel aan zult hebben
7308291 hoe ik er bij kwam dat wij een afspraak hadden dat was helemaal niet waar en je zult vandaag nog horen van mijn advocaat en ik waarschuw je dat je geen fotos meer publiceert
7308292 kees wees ze toch maar voor nodig in onze krant iedereen uit die het bandje wil afluisteren die nare stem is voor iedereen die hem kent zo duidelijk dat je daardoor helemaal ijzersterk komt te staan
7308293 dat is toch leblanc maar hoe kan die schoft dat nou nog ontkennen
7308294 nou kees hij ging inderdaad naar de veemarkt waar ik hem natuurlijk makkelijk kon volgen
7308295 stoor haar toch maar even want ik heb heel goed nieuws voor haar
7308296 als u wat te koop komt aanbieden of zoiets schiet dan maar gauw op ik heb niets nodig
7308297 nee mevrouw wat ik van u vraag is een half uurtje van uw tijd waar ik u goed voor zal betalen
7308298 toch zeker geen seks want daar ben ik niet van gediend waar het vrouwen betreft
7308299 nee mevrouw ik wil u een paar vragen stellen over de man die een klein half uurtje geleden bij u wegging naar het zich liet aanzien met een fikse ruzie ik ben inspectrice van een stichting die verborgen misdrijven op spoort hier hebt u mijn kaartje
7308300 nou vooruit dan maar maar u betaalt er wel voor h
7308301 als u meewerkt aan mijn interview overhandig ik u cash 2000 gulden
7308302 kunt u mij laten zien dat u dat geld dat ik vreselijk goed gebruiken kan echt bij u hebt
7308303 u hebt alle recht om zo wantrouwend te zijn want dit maak je niet alle dagen mee
7308304 komt u dan maar in de kamer en zeg wat ik voor dat geld moet doen
7308305 nou kijk ik heb hier een foto van de man die een uurtje geleden met ruzie bij u wegging
7308306 ja dat is de schoft ik wil hem nooit meer zien en ik zal u vertellen waarom u weet natuurlijk dat ik met prostitutie in mijn levensonderhoud voorzie ik zit niet voor het raam maar heb een vaste klantenkring ik heb geen pooier ik ben mijn eigen baas dat meisje dat u opendeed is een nichtje van mij een dochter van mijn zuster die vorig jaar helaas is overleden ik heb haar in huis genomen voor huishoudelijk werk boodschappen en wat er nog meer te doen is maar wat gebeurde een half uur geleden die schoft van uw foto komt mijn nichtje in de gang tegen en grijpt haar onverwacht tussen haar benen dat kind schrok zich een hoedje en begon te gillen ik sprong hem op zijn rug en wij hebben een robbertje geknokt en uiteindelijk wist ik hem de deur uit te werken het kind was helemaal overstuur wat een vuile smeerkees die vent
7308307 nou dat was mij al bekend en onze stichting is bezig de man die nog veel meer op zijn kerfstok heeft daarvoor te straffen bent u bereid achter op deze foto uw handtekening te zetten onder de tekst die ik nu ga opschrijven hiermede verklaar ik dat ik met de man op deze foto al jarenlang iedere maandag tegen betaling vleselijke gemeenschap heb gehad
7308308 dat wil ik wel tekenen maar moet mijn naam en adres er ook bij
7308309 ja dat moet wel maar het blijft geheel onder ons dat beloof ik u
7308310 ik betaalde haar en vertrok in een jubelstemming naar huis en nu krijg ik jouw commentaar en jij krijgt koffie met cognac
7308311 fantastisch werk meid werkelijk uit de kunst de eerste deuk in zijn bolwerk is er als zondag onze gouden tientjes truc gaat beginnen dan hebben we misschien al gauw een tweede bewijsstuk ik heb intussen van mijn relatie bij de pachtcommissie gelderland een concept pachtcontract ontvangen geheel up to date met indexeringsaanpassing wij hebben straks alleen nog maar de namen in te vullen en de handtekeningen er onder te krijgen
7308312 ik heb nog n vraag kees hoe wist jij nou in vredesnaam van tevoren hoe het in amsterdam zou lopen jij hebt voorspeld wat er zou kunnen gebeuren en het klopt precies hoe kan dat nou
7308313 ach ria je weet dat ik al vanaf mijn jeugd in misdaad ben ge nteresseerd ik heb er veel over gelezen en vooral de psychologische kanten hebben mij altijd erg geboeid ik kan mij heel aardig in zon misdadiger inleven en daarom wilde ik ook zo graag met leblanc kennismaken dat is dan niet doorgegaan maar ik heb zo langzamerhand toch een goed beeld van zijn karakter gekregen en in mijn werk heb ik natuurlijk nogal wat mensenkennis opgedaan
7308314 en nou ga ik maar weer eens naar slootwetering want je zult wel moe zijn na zon emotionele dag welterusten kanjer
7308315 natuurlijk jan wat een verrassing hoe gaat het met je en me je bureau
7308316 heel goed en daar bel ik je eigenlijk voor je weet waarschijnlijk wel dat ik naast mijn administratiekantoor ook veel werk verricht aan genealogie er is op dit gebied veel beunhazerij zoals je wel eens gehoord zult hebben maar ik heb voor dit onderdeel van mijn bureau een goede reputatie opgebouwd met veel dankbare cli nten ook een goede kennis van jou ha ha ha is ooit bij mij geweest met een opdracht nl de heer leblanc ik heb met belangstelling de manier gevolgd waarop je die vent de oren hebt gewassen mijn speurwerk voor die meneer heeft bijzonder belangwekkende dingen aan het licht gebracht ik denk dat dit ook jou erg zal interesseren doorgaans vertel ik deze zaken niet aan derden maar hij heeft mij nooit n cent betaald ondanks herhaald aandringen en nu wilde ik jou deelgenoot maken van mijn onderzoek dat wel heel apart is
7308317 nou jan hartstikke graag natuurlijk zullen wij samen een hapje eten vanmiddag half twee in de herbergh schikt dat
7308318 hallo jan fijn je weer eens te spreken je bent niet veel veranderd
7308319 nou dat geldt ook voor jou kees je hebt naam gemaakt als redacteur van het streekblad daar hebben zwart en jij iets heel goeds van gemaakt
7308320 zullen we eerst een aperitiefje nemen en onze lunch bestellen uiteraard voor mijn rekening
7308321 ik kreeg bezoek van een meneer die zich voorstelde als pierre leblanc uit patersdijck hij had wat in oude familiepapieren zitten bladeren en vroeg mij uit te zoeken waar de familienaam vandaan kwam volgens hem waarschijnlijk uit midden frankrijk hij had aanwijzingen dat er wel een ch teau leblanc bestond hij vroeg mij ook of er mogelijkheden waren om zijn naam om te zetten in ch teau leblanc namen met ch teau als een soort voorvoegsel komen wel voor bij de oude landadel in streken met veel wijnbouw ik vertelde hem dat in zon opdracht veel tijd en geld gingen zitten maar dat was geen bezwaar zei hij en als het niet lukt dan versiert u wel wat zei hij met een grijns op zijn gezicht dat ik direct onsympathiek vond ik heb hem toen wel verteld dat mijn onderzoeken nooit versiersels zijn maar altijd volkomen betrouwbaar maar daar reageerde hij alleen maar op met die grijns alsof hij zeggen wilde dat hij daar niets van geloofde maar goed ik heb voor dat soort zaken een uitgebreid netwerk opgebouwd met collegas in binnen en buitenland ik zette een paar mensen aan het werk en ging intussen zelf naar de nederlands hervormde kerk in patersdijck in het kerkarchief vond ik de naam leblanc voor het eerst in een brief uit 1816 er was een door een mijnheer p leblanc in het frans geschreven brief waarin hij verzocht toegelaten te worden tot de gemeente hij schreef een uit het leger van napoleon gevluchte soldaat te zijn maar hij durfde niet terug naar frankrijk hij had ook gehoord dat er in de nonnenpolder destijds eigendom van de kerk een boerderijtje kon worden gepacht waarvoor hij graag in aanmerking wilde komen er is in dit archief ook een verslag van de kerkenraadsvergadering waarin besloten werd op het verzoek van leblanc in te gaan echter onder voorwaarde dat hij gedoopt zou worden want hoewel hij beweerde dat dit in frankrijk al gebeurd was kon daarvoor in die roerige tijd geen bewijs worden geleverd in een ander stuk las ik dat de heer p leblanc inderdaad was bevestigd als belijdend lidmaat van de hervormde gemeente patersdijck tot zover het eerste hoofdstuk
7308322 de nasporingen in frankrijk leverden wel een paar ch teaus op maar geen ch teau leblanc
7308323 voor een andere cli nt moest ik naar groningen waar ik ook toegang heb tot oude politiearchieven een interessant stuk was een verslag van een brutale roofoverval in 1816 een zeer welgestelde herenboer was s nachts overvallen door zijn bedrijfsleider die er met een kapitaal bedrag aan geld en sieraden vandoor was gegaan hij was te paard gevlucht want ergens in friesland werd dat paard in een weiland tussen andere paarden teruggevonden de eigenaar van dat weiland had ineens een paard extra ontdekt en daarvan aangifte gedaan bij de politie het bleek inderdaad het paard van die groningse boer te zijn maar ondanks alle nasporingen werd er geen spoor van de dader gevonden die bedrijfsleider heette peter leblange en was van duitse afkomst zijn naam deed mij denken aan de in ons land voorkomende naam leeflang en wordt ook uitgesproken als leb lange hij had een jaar daarvoor naar de baan gesolliciteerd de boer vroeg of hij kon schrijven en zo ja of hij dan schriftelijk wilde solliciteren die brief in het duits was ook in het politiearchief te vinden toen ik die brief las had ik het gevoel dat ik dat handschrift in die typische duitse hanenpoten al eerder was tegen gekomen wat mij niet meer los liet ik maak met toestemming natuurlijk kopie n van de meest interessante stukken een dag later heb ik op kantoor de archieven van het laatste halfjaar nog eens doorgebladerd en ik had succes kees je zult het niet geloven maar het handschrift van de brief die leblanc aan de kerk in patersdijck had geschreven leek sprekend op dat van de sollicitatiebrief uit groningen dit was heel duidelijk hoewel de ene brief in het frans en de andere in het duits was geschreven ik heb mijn vermoeden voorgelegd aan een grafoloog met wie ik wel vaker samenwerk hij twijfelde geen ogenblik maar wilde graag de originelen zien dat heb ik geregeld en zijn conclusie was absoluut dezelfde schrijver dus kees de schrijver van de groningse brief heette peter leblange en de patersdijckse brief kwam van de hand van pierre leblanc de voorvader van onze vriend pierre leblanc was de rover uit groningen waarom hij bij mij kwam met dat verzoek zijn naam te veranderen weet ik niet misschien uit ijdelheid misschien wilde hij het rookgordijn nog wat dichter maken want het is nu duidelijk dat hij op de een of andere manier op de hoogte is van het groningse gebeuren en nu is het ook duidelijk waarom hij mij niet in de elzas wilde hebben want daar wonen misschien nog wel naamgenoten en ook begrijp ik nu dat hij zowel in het frans als in het duits kon schrijven wat zeg je me daarvan kees
7308324 jan ik sta echt stomverbaasd over dat geweldige speurwerk van je ik ben hier ontzettend blij mee en zal je vertellen waarom je bent behalve mijn zuster ria de enige die volledig op de hoogte wordt gesteld van ons gevecht met ja peter leblange
7308325 nou kees dat is me een verhaal zeg maar die roofoverval kun je hem natuurlijk niet verwijten
7308326 nee natuurlijk niet maar als ik alle bewijzen die ria en ik aan het verzamelen zijn rond heb ga ik hem confronteren met het feit dat ik net als hij de geschiedenis ken en ga ik hem aanspreken met peter leblange mogelijk kan ik hem hiermee naast de bewijzen van zijn vele vergrijpen de doodsteek toedienen kerel jan wat ben ik je dankbaar
7308327 je houdt mij wel van je vorderingen op de hoogte h en nog wat je mag met deze wetenschap doen wat je wilt maar nooit met bronvermelding daar vertrouw ik op
7308328 dus ik hoop dat je tijd hebt kees we hebben om acht uur afgesproken
7308329 ik zal er zijn zus want ik denk dat dit voor onze plannen wel eens heel belangrijk zou kunnen zijn
7308330 hoe gaat het op school in welke klas zit je doe je aan sport
7308331 zo nu kan ik tenminste zeggen dat ik op de h b s gelopen heb
7308332 het gaat over mijn vader u mag best weten dat ik nooit goed met hem heb kunnen opschieten hij was nooit thuis en bemoeide zich eigenlijk helemaal niet met mij gelukkig heb ik een schat van een moeder met wie ik dus juist een geweldige band heb zij heeft mij praktisch alleen opgevoed als mijn vader en ik elkaar tegenkomen hoeft er maar weinig te gebeuren of er ontstaat ruzie toen u laatst dat interview met hem zou hebben meneer van rietschoten en u op een werkelijk brute manier door hem werd behandeld ontstond er bijna slaande ruzie die alleen door tussenkomst van mijn moeder kon worden voorkomen ik was namelijk zo brutaal om te zeggen nou ze hadden u mooi te pakken zeg en ik was bijzonder blij met de manier waarop u en uw krant hem een lesje hebben geleerd ik was opgetogen over de nederlaag van mijn vader die toch eindelijk eens weerstand ondervond ik weet dat dit een beetje abnormaal klinkt maar het is wel een feit ik wil daar heel eerlijk in zijn
7308333 pierre drink je koffie op of heb je liever wat anders een colaatje bijvoorbeeld
7308334 nee ik wil eerst liever even mijn verhaal afmaken u weet waarschijnlijk dat renate m ller in deze vakantieperiode mijn ziekelijke moeder helpt met de huishouding renate is een ontzettend lieve meid die voor mijn moeder echt een engel is de laatste tijd is ze stil en bedroefd en toevallig hoorde ik een gesprek tussen haar en mijn vader hij vroeg haar wanneer ze nu voor de eerste keer met hem naar bed zou gaan want de tijd van het nieuwe pachtcontract begon te dringen ik wist niet wat ik hoorde wat een schoft die vader van mij renate heeft mij de volgende dag huilend verteld wat er aan de hand was en heeft mij ook dat wurgcontract laten lezen ik wist niet of ik er goed aan zou doen hem erover aan te spreken en daarom wil ik bij u juf om raad vragen of kunt u mij hierbij niet raden als hij renate nog een keer lastig valt dan vermoord ik hem
7308335 ik vecht me dood voor renate en voor mijn moeder die van hem ook geen goed woord krijgt renate kan natuurlijk weglopen maar ze laat mijn moeder beslist niet in de steek ze durft het ook niet tegen haar vriend bert landman te vertellen want die slaat mijn vader onherroepelijk het ziekenhuis in of nog erger wat moet ik nou toch
7308336 en ik zeg je nu alvast kalm maar we zullen je wel helpen
7308337 hoe ver gaan wij met het aan pierre bekend maken van onze plannen
7308338 luister pierre wat ik je nu ga vertellen is echt supergeheim ik weet niet of renate je daar wat van verteld heeft maar zij is een poosje geleden met diezelfde klacht over je vader al bij haar juf mijn zuster geweest die heeft mij ingeschakeld om te kijken of wij wat voor haar konden doen nou dat kunnen wij en hoe wij hebben wat dingen over je vader verzameld maar echt niet alleen die zaak over dat wurgcontract en renate pierre ik vind het heel rot dat ik dit zeggen moet maar je vader is en dan zeg ik het nog heel voorzichtig in vele opzichten een heel slecht mens wij hebben voldoende materiaal om hem voor eens en voorgoed de les te lezen ik zal je de details besparen en het is in het belang van ons hele onderzoek ook beter dat je die maar niet kent wij hebben bewijzen voor chantage diefstal en seksuele misdragingen maar die zullen we je pas vertellen als hij door de mand valt waar wij overigens geen moment aan twijfelen
7308339 nou meneer van rietschoten ik kijk met verlangen uit naar dat moment het is dan misschien wel heel vreemd dat te horen uit de mond van zijn enige zoon maar pak hem alstublieft heel hard aan vooral in het belang van mijn moeder en renate
7308340 ik vind het heel dapper van je dit zo te stellen en ik weet dat je het meent maar als wij ons plan uitgevoerd krijgen zoals wij dat zien is hij volledig knock out overigens de politie en de burgerij krijgen hier niets van te horen e n ding willen wij je alvast vertellen hij wordt gedwongen af te treden als ouderling van de kerk maar houd je mond nog even gesloten en bescherm intussen renate die je wel mag vertellen dat je ons gesproken hebt
7308341 fantastisch juf meneer van rietschoten wat ben ik blij dat u dit allemaal voor ons doet en natuurlijk zwijg ik als het graf
7308342 jij nog een cola pierre en jij je gebruikelijke cognacje kees ik neem zelf een sherry op de goede afloop
7308343 hoe kan een appel zo ver van de stam vallen gelukkig maar
7308344 nou zus wij gaan nu maar eens inventariseren wat hebben we ten eerste die tekst van je vriendin uit de warme buurt achter op zijn foto en dat wordt dan nog versterkt door de fotos die jij van die straat en dat huis hebt gemaakt ijzersterk bewijs zou ik zeggen dan heb ik hier de verklaring van notaris de groot over het deponeren van dat gouden tientje die wordt ondersteund door de verklaring van die juwelier uit marktstad en de door leblanc ondertekende kwitantie er zijn intussen alweer vijf van die wekelijkse kerkberichten uitgekomen dus een smoes vergeten of dat zou ik vandaag juist storten gaat niet meer op verder heb ik hier de beide pachtcontracten het wurgcontract en het door mijn gelderse vriend opgestelde normale contract in tweevoud ik heb de namen alvast ingevuld nu alleen de handtekeningen nog ik wil er liever geen gebruik van maken maar ik heb pierre jr telefonisch gevraagd of hij de klacht van renate wil ondersteunen zijn antwoord was volmondig ja natuurlijk eigenlijk griezelig hoe die jongen zijn vader haat maar nogmaals pas in laatste instantie zullen wij daar gebruik van maken die leblanc leblange geschiedenis zullen wij pas te berde brengen als meneer zich al te halsstarrig toont die voorvader van hem moet toch ook wel een brutaal mens zijn geweest hij had toch ook een andere franse naam kunnen verzinnen die minder leek op leblange je kunt deze leblanc leblange natuurlijk niets verwijten over die roofoverval maar reken maar dat het pijn doet als die geschiedenis uitkomt iedereen zal zich dan afvragen welke gemene streken er door de familie leblanc nog meer zijn uitgehaald om via het pachten van dat eerste kleine boerderijtje te komen tot het eigendom over de gehele nonnenpolder en dat hij die voorgeschiedenis kent en zich er meer dan anderhalve eeuw later nog voor inspant om dat zoveel mogelijk te verdoezelen dat wordt wel bewezen door zijn bezoeken aan jan de wit vooral zijn razernij toen de wit hem voorstelde het onderzoek in de elzas voort te zetten wijst erop dat hij hoe dat doet er niet toe volledig op de hoogte is ik denk dat als wij hem op een gegeven moment aanspreken met leblange hij zal reageren als door een wesp gestoken maar dat is onze troef voor de laatste slag de hamvraag is nu hoe regelen we de confrontatie en wat zullen wij vragen aan schadeloosstelling en smartengeld
7308345 precies kees dat is de lastigste klus van de hele aanpak wij moeten dit tactisch zo spelen dat hij niet meteen wegloopt als hij argwaan krijgt we kunnen een zaaltje huren maar we kunnen ons niet permitteren de deur op slot te doen
7308346 je hebt gelijk ria maar ik denk dat ik daar wel wat op gevonden heb
7308347 wat zeg je ervan zus zeg krijg ik eindelijk eens wat van je te drinken een pilsje als je hebt want ik heb een droge keel van al dat kletsen
7308348 hier is je pils en nu mijn commentaar ik ben bang dat hij toch argwaan krijgt en eenvoudig niet komt opdagen ik heb ook over de zaak nagedacht en ik vroeg me af of er niet wat in zou zitten om dominee van den heuvel vertrouwelijk in te lichten ik weet dat hij zoals zo velen een grote hekel heeft aan leblanc wij lichten hem in en tonen hem alle bewijsstukken wil of kan hij niet meewerken dan is er nog geen man overboord want hij is toch aan geheimhouding gebonden
7308349 maar als dat gebeurd is hebben we nog steeds geen gesprek met leblanc
7308350 wij zouden de dominee moeten vragen een gesprek bij hem thuis met ons drie n af te spreken
7308351 ik geloof nooit dat hij dat doet maar laten wij ook deze pijl maar op onze boog zetten bel jij hem op maak hem maar nieuwsgierig maar vertel hem nog maar geen details
7308352 het gaat om pierre leblanc dominee wij hebben verschrikkelijke dingen ontdekt over deze man en voelen ons verplicht u daarover in te lichten er zijn twee mensen die onze medewerking hebben ingeroepen nl renate m ller en u gelooft het niet pierre leblanc jr en om aan u te tonen hoe ernstig dit allemaal is hebben wij alle bewijsstukken meegebracht
7308353 ik sta perplex ik heb behoefte aan een drankje willen jullie wat drinken een glaasje wijn of een sherrytje jij ook john
7308354 maar wat kan ik doen ik vrees heel weinig maar jullie hebben ons niet voor niets ingelicht wat verwachten jullie van ons
7308355 kijk dominee als wij leblanc leblange in een zaaltje uitnodigen om hem te confronteren met al deze zaken dan stapt hij onmiddellijk op en wij kunnen hem niet tegenhouden dan blijft er niets anders over dan een klacht indienen bijvoorbeeld door renate maar dat is een lange weg en geeft een heleboel onrust en ongewenste publiciteit en zeer vervelende gevolgen voor leblanc vrezen wij want als de familie landman er achter komt gaan er heel nare dingen gebeuren waar wij nu op hopen is dat u met ons samen hetzelfde gesprek hebt met leblanc als vandaag wij hopen dat u in het belang van alle betrokkenen wilt meewerken om dit ettergezwel uit te snijden
7308356 u en uw vrouw zouden hem kunnen uitnodigen voor een gesprek met een paar deskundigen die hem een aantal misstanden uit onze mooie stad zullen voorleggen
7308357 ja maar door de aanwezigheid van u en uw echtgenote toch niet zo gauw er zijn dan in ieder geval twee getuigen en dat realiseert hij zich natuurlijk al snel wij willen beginnen met een brief die wij zogenaamd op het punt staan te versturen aan een vijftigtal notabelen uit onze stad althans daar dreigen wij mee wij hebben inderdaad een lijst met namen bovenaan die van leblanc samengesteld en een concept van de brief zal ria u even voorlezen
7308358 dit is alleen een dreigbrief die bedoeld is om hem door de knie n te krijgen want als deze brief aan hem is voorgelezen komt al gauw het moment dat hem duidelijk wordt gemaakt dat hij die schurk is staat hij op om de deur uit te gaan dan zeg ik wacht nog even herr leblange en als ik mij niet vergis reageert hij daar op als door een slang gebeten
7308359 tenslotte mevrouw dominee ik heb hier de voorpagina van ons streekblad waarop ik die hele leblanc leblange affaire uit de doeken doe dat ziet er echt uit nietwaar ik heb van jan de wit de genealoog en van de politie in groningen toestemming dit eventueel te publiceren want alles is natuurlijk al lang verjaard moet u eens kijken naar die kopie n van de brieven van de rover leblange het was voor de grafoloog een koud kunstje om te constateren dat dit het handschrift van een en dezelfde persoon was ik heb voor alle zekerheid ook nog juridisch advies ingewonnen maar ook daar kreeg ik carte blanche ik hoop alleen dat deze proefkrant nooit werkelijkheid wordt
7308360 wij hebben ook de schadeloosstelling het smartengeld en onze onkosten op papier gezet maar dat komt later wel ter sprake
7308361 ik geloof john dat wij mee moeten werken wat kan er gebeuren als het fout gaat en hij neemt toch de benen dan zal hij heus niet uit de school klappen hij kijkt wel mooi uit wij helpen weliswaar mee om hem in de val te laten lopen maar wij bewijzen daarmee zoveel mensen een dienst en dan zijn wij die griezel kwijt eigenlijk doen wij niets onoorbaars en wij doen ons geweten niet zo veel geweld aan
7308362 daar moet ik nog eens ernstig over nadenken jullie hebben ijzersterke argumenten maar toch ik twijfel ik wil dit hele geval nog eens rustig met jou bespreken louise ik zal u mevrouw van rietschoten morgenavond bellen is dat goed
7308363 jullie zullen vast wel begrijpen dat ik het als dominee hier moeilijk mee heb maar zoals ik gisteren al zei ik ben onder de indruk van jullie hele aanpak en vooral het feit dat wij onze stadgenoten kunnen verlossen van een heel slecht mens heeft ons doen besluiten ons verstand te laten zegevieren wij zullen hem vragen bij ons te komen wat denken jullie van donderdag 8 uur
7308364 dat is uitstekend dominee heel erg bedankt en nu maar hopen dat we hem op de knie n krijgen maar dat zal wel lukken
7308365 de stichting nemesis is een aantal dingen op het spoor gekomen die eenvoudig ongelooflijk zijn
7308366 en daar willen wij graag ook uw mening over hebben voorzitter ik geef u graag het woord
7308367 meneer leblanc ik heb hier een brief deze brief zit in de vijftig verzendklare enveloppen die u hier ziet liggen ook heb ik voor u ter inzage een lijst met de namen van de vijftig notabelen uit uw stad wilt u de brief even lezen en de lijst inzien
7308368 het spijt mij dat ik dat moet zeggen maar hier wordt uzelf mee bedoeld
7308369 dominee moet ik die flauwe kul aanhoren ik ga weg zijn jullie gek geworden
7308370 ik noem u bij de naam van uw voorvader de rover uit groningen en als u nu weer zitten gaat zullen wij u de bewijzen van al uw misdaden tonen en u vertellen hoe u aan de publicatie van dit fraais kunt ontkomen
7308371 het gemeenste dat u hebt gedaan is het infame voorstel aan renate m ller of ontkent u dat
7308372 ik heb hier een volkomen legaal nieuw pachtcontract tussen u en heinz m ller dat ik u verzoek nu van uw handtekening te voorzien
7308373 hier heb ik vervolgens een verklaring van notaris de groot dat hij op zondag 12 juni een gouden tiengulden stuk heeft gedeponeerd in de door u gehanteerde collectezak twee dagen later hebt u dit muntstuk verkocht aan de juwelier in marktstad wat u niet wist is dat op die munt een geheim tekentje was aangebracht waardoor het zeker was dat dit het exemplaar uit de collectezak was de verklaring van de juwelier heb ik hier en tevens de door u ondertekende kwitantie van tweehonderd gulden wij zijn nu vijf weken verder dus kom nu niet met een smoes durft u te ontkennen dat u dat geld eenvoudig ingepikt hebt nee toch verder heb ik hier een brief die ik u verzoek te ondertekenen het is duidelijk dat u uw kerkelijke functies moet neerleggen om alle schijn te vermijden hebben wij geschreven dat u met onmiddellijke ingang wegens te drukke werkzaamheden aftreedt als ouderling
7308374 aan de publieke vrouw die u jarenlang op maandag na de markt in amsterdam bezocht hebben wij een bedrag betaald voor haar medewerking u ziet hier haar verklaring achter op uw foto en de fotoreportage die ria van rietschoten van de locatie en van uw worsteling met die vrouw heeft gemaakt ik laat u ook nog even de pagina zien van het streekblad zoals die eruit zou komen te zien als u te elfder ure de kop nog in de wind zou gooien u leblanc leblange wordt volledig afgebrand zoals u ziet die vijftig brieven worden als u verder meewerkt niet verzonden de kosten die u betalen moet zijn de kerk 250 gulden nl de opbrengst van het gouden tientje 50 gulden de genealoog bent u voor al zijn werk 500 gulden schuldig de publieke vrouw betaalden wij 2000 gulden voor haar informatie renate krijgt 500 gulden smartengeld nemesis d w g maakte in totaal 1750 gulden aan onkosten het totaal is 5000 gulden die u morgen cash moet ophalen bij de bank ik heb hier een grote envelop waar u het geld in moet deponeren die envelop wordt overmorgen door een koerier bij u opgehaald s middags om twee uur u voorkomt bij betaling een aantal aanklachten die u een veelvoud van 5000 gulden kosten nog afgezien van mogelijke gevangenisstraf u koopt hiermee een volledig zwijgen van alle ingewijden dat garanderen wij u wij zorgen voor de betaling aan de belanghebbenden op het ouderlingschap na kunt u al uw functies blijven vervullen ik wil u tenslotte nog waarschuwen dat nemesis u scherp in de gaten blijft houden en hierbij wil ik het laten tenzij een van de andere aanwezigen nog iets zou willen zeggen
7308375 wat denkt u meneer van rietschoten zou hij het geld inderdaad in de envelop doen
7308376 dat is afwachten natuurlijk maar ik denk wel dat we hem met al die bewijzen murw hebben gekregen
7308377 ik wil nogmaals benadrukken wat een geweldig werk jullie voor de maatschappij hebben verricht
7308378 toch verbaas ik mij erover hoe snel hij door de knie n ging zijn reputatie kennende
7308379 om n of andere reden zit die leblange leblanc geschiedenis hem heel erg hoog ik denk uit angst voor het uitkomen ervan maar je hebt gelijk het ging onverwacht snel gelukkig maar
7308380 dat is natuurlijk de verklaring voor de onverwacht geringe tegenstand want zijn reputatie kennende verbaasde mij dat wel heel erg
7308381 ja daar heb je absoluut gelijk in anders had ik het nog niet geweten misschien kan heinz m ller dat boerderijtje voor een prikkie overnemen
7308382 blijft nog zijn beweegreden om die leblange geschiedenis te verdoezelen maar daar zullen wij wel nooit achter komen
7308383 nee ik niet maar thomas wel ik werd net gebeld door buurvrouw grootjes thomas is beroofd
7308384 wat zegt u me nou thomas beroofd nou u bent wel een onheilsboodschapper zeg een paar jaar geleden belde u mij over die postzegelinbraak bij coby en nou dit weer nee praat maar niet verder bedankt voor de bel ik spring in mijn auto
7308385 zo kees alweer een primeur voor jou in dit voor misdadigers blijkbaar aantrekkelijke oord
7308386 maar mijn alibi is ook nu weer zo van ijzer dat je er geen speld tussen zou kunnen krijgen gesteld dat je dat zou willen onderzoeken maar hoe is het met thomas
7308387 nou hij is niet gewond maar hevig geschrokken de dokter denkt aan shock en wil hem in het ziekenhuis laten opnemen ik mag hem ook nog niet uitgebreid verhoren kijk daar dragen ze hem juist in de ziekenauto
7308388 maar hoe is het nu precies gegaan en wie heeft het ontdekt enfin dat zijn natuurlijk vragen van zon persmuskiet die jij voorlopig toch niet beantwoorden zal ik zal je niet langer ophouden succes dick
7308389 ik was gister een beetje grieperig en ben daarom niet naar marktstad gegaan
7308390 en toen ik door de keukendeur naar binnen riep h thomas is je horloge kapot hoorde ik een vreemd geluid in de achterkamer zat thomas vastgebonden op een stoel met een prop in zn mond en geblinddoekt
7308391 dat het verhoor van thomas nog wat oplevert maar dat gebeurt op zn vroegst vanavond en kees doe me een plezier in de krant voorlopig alleen het gewone de politie volgt een aantal sporen
7308392 ok maar heb je al inzicht in het gestolen bedrag
7308393 nee want de linkmichels zijn zo slim geweest ook het kasboek mee te nemen maar misschien kan thomas mij daar wat over vertellen
7308394 nou dan heb ik misschien nog wel een goede tip voor je heb je al contact gehad met de stichting akkersanering
7308395 nee die hebben wel contact gezocht maar ik moest nog een andere dringende zaak afwerken dus ben ik daar door alle drukte nog niet aan toe gekomen
7308396 dat zou ik dan maar gauw doen want het gerucht gaat dat zij voor n nacht twee ton in de brandkast van thomas geparkeerd hadden
7308397 wat zeg je me nou twee ton waarvoor dat in vredesnaam
7308398 ik weet er ook het fijne nog niet van maar ik denk dat peter de caf baas je daar wel wat meer over kan vertellen maar dat die overval uitgerekend op deze dag plaats vindt kan volgens mij geen toeval zijn die mensen van de stichting zijn er waarschijnlijk ook nog wel en misschien krijg je op die manier nog wat draden in je vingers
7308399 zo zie je maar dick die persmuskieten hoeven niet altijd hinderlijk te zijn
7308400 daar hebben we kees jongens onze speurneus is binnen kees wie heeft het gedaan kees als je het zelf gedaan hebt dan willen we delen hoor
7308401 je moet wel bedenken dat er maar weinig mensen in het dorp zijn op zon dinsdag maar ik zou daarbij echt niemand kunnen aanwijzen die het mogelijk kan hebben gedaan
7308402 jij woont tenslotte vlakbij en je wist van die enorme koopsom
7308403 peter heeft de boel gejat en heeft paul zogenaamd de ontdekking laten doen samsam jongens
7308404 kees heeft het gedaan ja die goochemerd zorgt zelf voor een mooi alibi maar twee handlangers van hem flikken het kunstje op de fiets
7308405 nou zijn chagrijnige bui is zeker over gisteren zag hij me niet eens staan
7308406 hoe laat voer piet hier gisteren langs moeder ik dacht dat hij toen het nog donker was al op weg was naar zijn visstek
7308407 nou ik denk tegen half elf ik zou met de bus van vijf over half elf naar marktstad gaan
7308408 kees ik sta opnieuw perplex je hebt maar een klein draadje nodig om alles perfect uiteen te rafelen en je vergist je zelden of nooit en als je de zaak rond hebt pik je zelf ook nog een graantje mee wat een vreemde snoeshaan ben je eigenlijk maar ik wil graag met je meedenken over hoe dit afgerond kan worden en ik ben er een beetje trots op dat je mij inschakelt
7308409 nou ria jij hebt in het verleden je sporen op dit gebied toch ook verdiend ik zou niemand beter kunnen aanwijzen als klankbord dan jij
7308410 dus kees als ik je goed begrijp wil je die jongens de boer sparen maar op n of andere manier de buit op die ene door jou gepikte envelop na zogenaamd opsporen of laten opsporen
7308411 precies ria en vertel jij mij nou eens hoe je dat zou aanpakken
7308412 kan ik daar een nachtje over slapen je zei al dat je verwacht dat de de boertjes zich wel even rustig zullen houden dus er is wel wat speling kom morgenavond maar terug ik heb al een idee maar dat vertel ik je nog niet
7308413 nou barst maar los ik ben nieuwsgierig naar wat je uitgebroed hebt ria
7308414 ik geloof dat wij de de boertjes er op n of andere manier ertoe moeten bewegen de buit terug te geven er zit een hele linke kant aan die duizendjes zij zijn genummerd en onherroepelijk geregistreerd al wachten zij nog jaren met het uitgeven ervan zij gaan bij de eerste de beste poging onherroepelijk in de boot ik zou als ik jou was die jongens daarvoor waarschuwen maar wel anoniem natuurlijk ik heb een brief opgesteld gericht aan paul de boer ik lees hem voor
7308415 nou zus je moet nodig wat van mij zeggen hoe is het mogelijk dat je dit zo uitgevlooid hebt chapeau hoor ik vind het een geweldige aanpak schrijf je die brief even met je bekende niet te achterhalen hoofdletterschrift dan post ik hem morgenochtend in hoorn je weet veiligheid voor alles
7308416 nou je hebt ze een voorzet gegeven die ze alleen nog maar hebben in te koppen ik heb gehoord dat de stakkers een grote beloning gaan uitloven voor de opsporing van daders en buit dat zal dan wel via mijn streekblad gebeuren en dat lezen die jongens natuurlijk ook hoe ze het dan verder aanpakken moeten we maar even afwachten misschien komen ze mij wel om raad vragen want ik heb op dit terrein nu eenmaal een reputatie
7308417 ok hier is je brief even goed afvegen ook de envelop en de postzegel ben ik een goede leerling of niet
7308418 moet je nou eens lezen kees ik weet niet wat ik hier nu van denken moet een geintje van onze lieve dorpsgenoten of is dit serieus
7308419 ik denk dat je er toch maar vanuit moet gaan dat dit serieus bedoeld is maar zou je de politie niet inschakelen
7308420 daar hebben wij het samen ook al over gehad kun jij die van der waal er niet over bellen
7308421 natuurlijk dat kan ik zelfs meteen wel doen ik heb zn priv telefoonnummer ik hoop dat hij thuis is
7308422 ja hij neemt op hallo dick met kees van rietschoten sorry dat ik je zo laat nog stoor maar ik heb hier paul de boer die een heel aparte anonieme brief heeft gekregen over die roofoverval wat zeg je of je meteen komen kan natuurlijk je weet waar ik woon welkom
7308423 nou jongens sneller kan het niet h het zit hem erg hoog dat hij nu voor de tweede keer in slootwetering bot dreigt te vangen
7308424 kees als wij dat geld zouden vinden denk jij dat wij dan die 5 voor het opsporen van de buit ook krijgen als we de daders niet kunnen aanwijzen
7308425 ja hoor kijk maar ik heb hier de advertentie 5 voor het geld en 5 als de daders worden gevonden
7308426 ik wil best op ons stekkie eens rondneuzen het moet toch niet zo moeilijk zijn om net als die briefschrijver dat geld op te sporen als het er inderdaad ligt
7308427 en dan moeten wij eens overleggen wat we nog meer kunnen doen
7308428 als ik hier binnen rondkijk dan heb ik er niet veel vertrouwen in waar moet je in vredesnaam iets verstoppen nee ik neig er toch toe dat we in de boot zijn genomen letterlijk en figuurlijk
7308429 want ik krijg sterk de indruk dat we een verloren ochtend achter de rug hebben
7308430 kees heeft er in jouw krant iets gestaan over briefjes van 1000
7308431 nee want ik heb met de inspecteur de afspraak om dat soort informatie voorlopig niet te vermelden
7308432 nou hoe komt die briefschrijver dan aan die wijsheid dan is die brief toch geen geintje maar een echte aanwijzing als het inderdaad waar is want alleen de leiding van de stichting akkersanering zal dat hebben geweten ik denk dat ook thomas dat niet wist
7308433 maar hoe kunnen we er dan met zn allen niet in slagen om dat spul op te sporen op zon klein plekje
7308434 ik heb gelezen over speciaal afgerichte drugshonden zijn er ook honden die gespecialiseerd zijn in het opsporen van geld
7308435 ja daar heb ik ook al aan gedacht maar ik zou eerlijk gezegd niet weten wat er daar voor zon beest nog te snuffelen valt maar goed je weet het maar nooit kees mag ik even bellen met de zaak
7308436 jullie kunnen mijn boot morgen wel nemen ik kan niet mee maar jullie paul en piet wel
7308437 inspecteur als dat geld gevonden wordt hebt u maar een klein kringetje verdachten want het moet haast wel een hengelaar zijn het is een koud kunstje om bij onze vereniging de ledenlijst op te vragen
7308438 en als het iemand is die bij lagerwal een bootje gehuurd heeft dan staat hij op de registerlijst want alle dagvergunningen worden ingeschreven
7308439 ik heb er zo maar twee rechercheurs bij nou ik zal graag van jullie tips gebruik maken en als we succes hebben dan is de beloning van de stichting akker sanering natuurlijk voor jullie
7308440 ik heb nog nooit zoveel geld in mijn handen gehad
7308441 kom binnen neem een drankje en vertel op ik ben hartstikke nieuwsgierig
7308442 nou we hebben eerst castor de hond het erfje nog eens grondig laten besnuffelen nadat we hem eerst lucht van bankbiljetten hadden gegeven dat leverde niets op en ik dacht verdorie zijn we toch in de boot genomen we gingen koffie drinken in de hut en castor liep wat rond te snuffelen hij had opvallend veel belangstelling voor de tafel en sprong daar op een bepaald moment zelfs bovenop onze hondengeleider herkende deze gedragingen en stelde voor de tafel kist om te keren dit ging vrij vlot maar ook toen de kist met de poten omhoog op de grond lag was er in de eerste instantie niets te zien maar castor bleef onrustig en ging zelfs op de onderkant van de tafel krabben en zachtjes blaffen en toen zagen wij het er was geklemd tussen de poten en heel slim in dezelfde houtkleur een tweede tafelblad aangebracht waardoor er een holle bergruimte ontstond wij wrikten dat extra blad los en ja hoor daar lagen twee enveloppen die ik uit voorzorg met handschoenen aanpakte op de buitenzijde van beide enveloppen stond 100x1000 raak dus ik heb de hut verzegeld want ik wil morgen nog even met onze man van de vingerafdrukken terug kan ik daar komen over het erf van die boer
7308443 ja dat kan makkelijk als je hem eerst even belt ik heb hier zn telefoonnummer voor je maar wat ben ik blij voor je dick en jullie kan ik wel feliciteren jongens want de beloning is voor jullie heeft de inspecteur beloofd
7308444 die boeven hebben dus alleen de kas van thomas ingepikt maar hoeveel dat is weten we nog niet
7308445 ik was er gisteren al dichtbij toen ik met mijn zaklantaarn onderin de kist scheen maar die holle ruimte was wel perfect gecamoufleerd dus ik verwijt mijzelf maar niets je ziet overigens weer hoe de mens het dier nodig heeft nietwaar castor

7308461 durante las temporadas de 1998 y 1999 hubo un cambio de humor como si un nuevo tipo de energ a se hubiera alojado en la tierra

7308464 habr un nuevo equilibrio y una nueva armon a que va a prevalecer en la tierra nunca jam s antes ha habido tantos seres tan altamente espirituales como vosotros en la tierra y estoy seguro de que ser is capaces de difundir esta energ a esta armon a sobre todo en esta nueva
7308465 esto es un amor y esto es una luz que proviene del sol central hay una nueva energ a arm nica que se activar el 8 de agosto del 2008 sta es una energ a m s nueva que viene del gran sol central que va a ser una ola que pasar por el planeta el planeta la tierra vibra a una cierta frecuencia y esta frecuencia se puede definir como una ola esta ola esta onda se ve afectada como es el hombre por ejemplo en la tierra la energ a nuclear la ansiedad la esperanza y toda la energ a positiva todo se mezcla en un cierto tipo de frecuencia quiz s esto se pueda llamar el pulso de la tierra pero ahora una ola m s nueva se acerca hacia abajo hacia la tierra de manera que una nueva frecuencia que se llama frecuencia arm nica estar oscilando por el centro de la tierra incluyendo telos y todas las ciudades del interior del la tierra y por todas las ciudades que est n en la superficie en el exterior de la tierra esto se llama la nueva convergencia arm nica del 8 8 8 hubo una energ a de convergencia arm nica en 1997 y todo el mundo estaba tan emocionado que dec an vamos a retener la energ a pero no se qued all la gente lo intent y qu es lo que va a ser distinto ahora esta energ a ahora proviene de una uni n con el sol central y las semillas estelares como vosotros ten is m s tecnolog a espiritual as pues ten is que querer cambiar el mundo pero tambi n y est is recibiendo esta tecnolog a ahora

7308469 si hay una forma de armonizar de sanar las partes polarizadas de mi yo estoy queriendo estoy abierto a mirar dentro de mi yo a esas partes polarizadas que existen en mi

7308471 zo ventje was t gezellig dat ging wel zo te zien nou k gun het je van harte zo is jouw lieve mien
7308472 soms gaat de leugen v r de waarheid en spreekt haar strikt geheime taal
7308473 nee hoor mijnheer dat heb ik niet gedaan maar me zussie
7308474 oh zei het meisje dan mag ik niet met je spelen
7308475 frank jullie zijn hervormd h nou wij niet wij zijn lekker gereformeerd wij komen lekker in de hemel
7308476 nou zeg je zegt ja maar je kop zegt nee
7308477 oh ik zie ze al ze zijn gelukkig niet nat geregend want ze staan onder de heg
7308478 frans was met zn vader en moeder naar het amsterdamse bos geweest en daar had hij een man en een vrouw gezien die aan het neuken waren
7308479 h mama wat liggen we nou toch lekker te neuken h
7308480 oh die heb ik hier in mijn zak het was zo warm
7308481 oh we kwamen op het schoolplein en toen riepen die jongens
7308482 h wil je wel es met je pote van dat kind afblijve
7308483 mot je es staan blijve zal ik es effe bij je komme
7308484 dat rotjong zit altijd mijn pietje te pesten ik krijg hem nog wel eens te pakken de rotzak
7308485 verdorie ik tref het toch maar zelden met het weer
7308486 weet u dat dooie stuk sloot waar ik vorig jaar een dam in heb gelegd ja nou volgens arie de zoon van een jaar of zeventien zitten er een paar grote vissen in hij zegt dat hij ze al een paar keer heeft zien kolken wat denkt u zou dat nou kunnen
7308487 nou dan zou er misschien wel een visje in kunnen zitten en misschien hebt u er ook wel een paar ingesloten met die dam maar grote vissen lijken mij onwaarschijnlijk
7308488 vader zegt dat u mij niet gelooft h nou dan moet u eens heel voorzichtig met mij meekomen
7308489 kijk nou maar eens links van dat dorre waterlelieblad zowat een meter uit de kant
7308490 ik heb het niet goed verstaan ene bruis geloof ik
7308491 oh meneer cruyff mijn moeder had uw naam niet goed verstaan wat kan ik voor u doen
7308492 dat zal ik je zeggen je weet dat wij morgen tegen feyenoord spelen en nu wilde ik dat je naar amsterdam kwam om die wedstrijd bij te wonen vanaf de reservebank ik vind het voor je verdere ontwikkeling erg goed dat je die speciale sfeer alvast eens proeft
7308493 nou dat is een verrassing hartstikke graag natuurlijk hoe laat moet ik er zijn
7308494 nou kijk je hoeft natuurlijk niet te spelen maar neem wel je spullen mee dan kun je bij het inspelen ook een balletje meetrappen ik zet je gewoon op de reservelijst en als je er dan om twaalf uur bent kun je samen met de andere jongens een hapje mee eten dan is het net echt
7308495 dat zal precies gaan maar u weet dat mijn ouders er op staan dat ik eerst naar de kerk ga dat is om kwart over elf afgelopen dus is het wel kiele kiele
7308496 niks kiele kiele als jij om kwart over elf op het centraal station van jullie wereldstad staat word je opgepikt door keje molenaar voor hem is dat maar een minuutje om ik heb hem al gebeld
7308497 nou ik weet niet of je vader dat nu wel zo leuk vindt je weet dat dat voetballen op zondag hem nu eenmaal niet zo lekker zit
7308498 hoor eens moeder daar hebben we het nu al zo vaak over gehad de afspraak is dat ik mijn kerkelijke plichten vervul en dat doe ik ook nog met overtuiging maar dat jullie mijn voetbalcarri re niet in de weg staan tenslotte verdien ik er nu al een leuke zakcent mee en wie weet wat er nog verder uit komt en bovendien
7308499 als je je nu al zo druk maakt over het intrappen v r de wedstrijd wat moet dat dan worden als je ooit nog eens echt mee mag doen
7308500 nou die hebben het zo georganiseerd dat je ook op zaterdag naar de kerk kan ik ga ook altijd op zaterdag
7308501 ik denk dat mijn streng calvinistische vader een beroerte kreeg als ik het hem voorstelde
7308502 kan geen bal raken zo groot als een luchtballon maar praatjes mensen praatjes zorg jij nou eerst maar voor een goal vanmiddag dan zal ik aan de boerenbond vragen of jij de kat mag leren melken aan zijn staart
7308503 oh wat zou ik zenuwachtig wezen als ik mee moest doen
7308504 jongens laat je nu niet ontmoedigen door zon minder goede eerste helft ik heb al zo vaak meegemaakt dat een goed elftal een poosje helemaal vast zit en dan zit je te zoeken naar verklaringen maar die zijn er niet of nauwelijks wellicht zijn jullie toch een beetje ge mponeerd door de faam van feyenoord en mis je daardoor net die meter of die ntiende seconde die je nodig hebt om de bal wel te kunnen aannemen maar wat ik ook ondervonden heb is dat de vonk plotseling kan overslaan en wat is nou helemaal n goaltje achterstand op de helft van de wedstrijd stuk voor stuk zijn jullie geen haar minder dan je directe tegenstander maar daar moet je natuurlijk wel in blijven geloven let maar eens op onze betere techniek gaat in de tweede helft als ze wat vermoeid beginnen te raken een belangrijke rol spelen trouwens als ze dat cadeautje niet hadden gekregen van de scheidsrechter dan stond het nu nog gelijk en wie zegt er dat wij ook niet eens zon mazzeltje zouden kunnen krijgen tactisch loopt het niet slecht maar zwem niet in die fuik voor hun doel die snuiters zijn lang en koppen goed speel ze nu eens langs de grond uit daar zijn jullie juist zo sterk in kom eens naar binnen vanaf die buitenlijn die hoge ballen voor de pot halen toch weinig uit en schieten zoals jesper een paar keer gedaan heeft dat is de manier nou mannen t is bijna tijd denk erom geen zenuwen en vooral geen paniek want als we verliezen dan worden we gewoon een weekje later kampioen dan we gedacht hadden en blijf je spel spelen zoals wij het afspraken
7308505 cees ga je gauw een beetje warm lopen dan kun jij die laatste 20 minuten voor tjeu invallen
7308506 in het elftal van ajax wordt tjeu la ling vervangen door de jeugdspeler cees van rietschoten
7308507 zorg ervoor dat een invaller zo snel mogelijk balcontact krijgt
7308508 ik weet niet of je met je meisje hebt afgesproken voor vanavond maar dit is voor de publiciteit zo belangrijk dat je die afspraak maar moet afzeggen
7308509 okee dan zal ik mijn ouders wel even bellen want nelly kan ik niet bereiken dan waarschuwen zij haar wel even hoe laat zou het worden
7308510 even kijken die uitzending duurt een half uur even nababbelen dan is het 9 uur en ik breng je wel even thuis dus laten we zeggen een uur of 10
7308511 oh ben jij het kom je al gauw naar huis
7308512 nee moeder t wordt wat later ik denk om een uur of 10 thuis te zijn wilt u nelly even waarschuwen
7308513 dat is een heel lang verhaal maar als u het precies wilt weten kijk dan om 8 uur even naar de televisie het tweede net
7308514 nee ik zeg niets meer ga maar kijken en haal vader ook over dat te doen nou tot vanavond en denkt u even om nelly daag
7308515 dames en heren meisjes en jongens vandaag in het kader van ons nieuwe sportprogramma
7308516 niks gouden handje dat bestaat trouwens helemaal niet en ik ben blij dat ik nu eens met dat sprookje kan afrekenen ik heb inderdaad een paar keer geluk gehad met een wissel maar echt geloof mij daar is niets mysterieus aan kijk ajax beschikt over een stuk of 16 volkomen gelijkwaardige spelers en als zon frisse talentvolle jonge voetballer dan in het veld komt als de anderen er al een vermoeiende partij op hebben zitten dan kan zon knaap wel eens bijzonder uitblinken en neem nu vandaag het voorstel om cees in te zetten kwam niet van mij maar van bobby haarms wordt wiggemanse niet ziek dan speelt hij en niet cees van rietschoten ik had cees alleen maar opgeroepen in het kader van zijn opleiding en om hem dus wat aan die aparte sfeer te laten wennen en dat wist hij trouwens zelf ook vandaar ook dat hij van tevoren niet zenuwachtig kon worden en toen tjeu uitviel bij de stand 1 3 had ik om je de waarheid te zeggen de wedstrijd al zon beetje opgegeven toen bobby met zijn voorstel kwam dacht ik ach waarom eigenlijk niet en ging ik ermee akkoord en als het dan zo uitpakt dan heb je eenvoudig ik zeg het maar een beetje kernachtig dan heb je strontmazzel
7308517 zo johan dat laat dan aan duidelijkheid niet te wensen over geen gouden handjes maar stronthandjes dus enfin als het resultaat maar hetzelfde is zal het je ook een zorg zijn
7308518 goed en nou jij cees hoe voel jij je nu
7308519 nou om te beginnen veel zenuwachtiger dan vanmiddag en verder ja ik ben nog steeds bang dat ik straks met een klap uit mijn bed val en dat het allemaal alleen maar een droom geweest is maar dan was het wel een hele mooie
7308520 ik snap het maar echt het is de werkelijkheid dus uit je bed vallen is er niet bij tenminste niet tijdens de uitzending maar kun je ons ook vertellen wat je voelde toen je er in moest
7308521 ach t ging allemaal zo snel dat ik nauwelijks tijd had om ergens aan te denken maar t is net wat meneer cruyff zegt het is maar goed dat ik het van tevoren niet geweten heb want dan had ik waarschijnlijk stijf gestaan van de zenuwen
7308522 ik zag op de filmbeelden dat van hanegem wat tegen je zei toen je het veld inkwam en jij zei toen waarschijnlijk wat terug waarop hij begon te lachen mogen we weten wat jullie te vertellen hadden
7308523 ja hoor dat mag best van hanegem probeerde mij een beetje te dollen en mij nog v r ik een bal geraakt had mij wat te imponeren nou mag dat best want ook die dingen zijn een onderdeel van het spel vind ik ik had toevallig een goed antwoord bij de hand en daar moest hij om lachen
7308524 nou vooruit dan maar willem zei zeg knulletje mag jij eigenlijk al alleen buiten spelen van je moeder en toen zei ik ja hoor meneer maar ik moet wel uitkijken voor vieze ouwe mannetjes en toen moest hij heel erg lachen
7308525 en nou de wedstrijdbeelden wij hebben wat speciale vertraagde en ook stilstaande beelden bij die twee doelpunten die volgens de spelers buitenspel waren en ook van die ongelukkige penalty van wim jansen
7308526 johan eerst de eerste goal van feyenoord wat vond jij ervan buitenspel of niet
7308527 okee en wil jij nu commentaar geven bij die goal van olsen cees
7308528 u moet eens opletten hoe snel jesper is en hoe hij niet in een rechte maar in een zigzaglijn naar het doel gaat en nu komt dat schot ziet u hij heeft helemaal geen ruimte nodig de bal komt onder zijn lichaam vandaan en dan zo laag en zo hard schieten dat is absoluut uniek ik weet geen voetballer op te noemen die hem dat nadoet
7308529 dank je wel cees en nu die penalty johan daar komen de beelden
7308530 en toen was het rust wat je allemaal gezegd hebt tegen je spelers dat weet ik natuurlijk niet maar ajax was als herboren dat klinkt als een clich maar t was echt zo hoe doe je dat nou
7308531 als je alle krachten en invloeden die op zon moment tegelijk aan het werk zijn zou kunnen analyseren dan was het niet zo moeilijk maar zo is het nu eenmaal niet er blijven altijd krachten over die je niet kunt plaatsen en die joris van den bergh al mysterieuze krachten noemde ik heb naar mijn idee niets bijzonders gezegd cees zal dat kunnen beamen misschien heb ik ze geraakt door op te merken dat we ook bij verlies toch wel kampioen zouden worden wie zal het zeggen maar laten we blij zijn dat we niet alles weten wiskunde is een exacte wetenschap voetballen gelukkig niet dan was de lol er gauw af
7308532 en toen werd het weer echt voetbal h jullie maar beuken op het doel maar weinig of geen geluk een uitval van feyenoord en pats 1 3 hier komen beelden en graag jouw commentaar johan
7308533 nou ja dat is natuurlijk ook al zo oud als de voetbalsport zelf de sterkste of de meest aanvallende ploeg wint nu eenmaal lang niet altijd je wordt kijk zelf maar een beetje overmoedig lukt het nu niet dan wel over vijf of 10 minuten je komt niet goed meer terug na een afgeslagen aanval je blijft maar even hangen want die bal komt toch zo weer bij je en dan gebeurt het onverwachte maar wat een schoonheid van een doelpunt van die vermeulen het lijkt sprekend op die goal van olsen voor de rust
7308534 toen was de wedstrijd wel zon beetje bekeken ook naar je eigen oordeel dat heb je zojuist ook opgemerkt en besloten jullie cees alvast maar wat routine te laten opdoen zo is het toch gegaan
7308535 zo is het inderdaad gegaan al twijfel jij daar nog steeds aan
7308536 maar wist je dan niet wat voor supertalent je op de bank had zitten kende je cees van rietschoten als voetballer
7308537 ja natuurlijk wel je weet wel hoe ik altijd met jong talent bezig ben en cees heeft inderdaad veel natuurlijke aanleg maar wat hij vandaag presteerde heeft naast aanleg ook te maken met een heleboel andere zaken waaronder vooral geluk die andere factoren moeten wij in samenspraak met de trainersstaf nog maar eens op geen rijtje zetten daar is natuurlijk nog geen tijd voor geweest maar van tevoren voorspellen of zelfs maar te hopen dat deze jonge knul het in deze wedstrijd helemaal zou gaan maken dat kan natuurlijk geen sterveling
7308538 en nu terug naar de wedstrijdbeelden nou cees nu komt jouw grote periode hier komen de beelden van jouw eerste en dus ajax tweede goal graag je commentaar
7308539 nou ik kreeg de bal hier zoals u ziet op het middenveld passte op molenaar en die vindt daar kieft gaat zelf snel verder langs de zijlijn krijgt nu de bal weer terug en zet dan vanaf de achterlijn voor keihard en schuin naar de rand van het strafschopgebied ik was ook op volle snelheid en kon de bal in de richting van het doel koppen maar raakte hem erg slecht boven op mijn kop maar ik zei al die voorzet van keje was erg hard en daardoor kreeg de bal zoveel lengte dat hij in de kruising zakte dat is eigenlijk geen afstand om rechtstreeks op doel te koppen maar nu lukte het dus toevallig wel
7308540 molenaar knalt die bal zo hard alsof hij hem helemaal naar de andere kant van het veld wilde trappen jij raakt hem heel eventjes en hangen maar raak je zon bal nou niet gauw veel te hard of helemaal niet
7308541 ja daar moet je natuurlijk een grote portie geluk bij hebben maar in dit geval was die manier van corner nemen helemaal afgesproken tussen ons dus heel anders als bij die eerste goal
7308542 kijk ik wil graag even opmerken dat ik ze eigenlijk verboden heb om corners zo te nemen t lukt toch bijna nooit maar wat ben ik blij dat ze deze keer ongehoorzaam waren keje vertelde mij dat hij er eigenlijk voor 100 zeker van was dat t nu wel lukken zou en cees zegt precies hetzelfde en dat bedoel ik nou dat zeker weten dat is nu zon mysterieuze kracht die nooit te vatten is die is er of die is er niet
7308543 wat perste dat feyenoord er een slotoffensief uit ongelooflijk na al die inspanning
7308544 ja en toen die laatste minuut een historische een gekopte goal liggend op de grond hoe verzin je t
7308545 och ik deed het in een flits zonder erbij na te denken
7308546 nou de geweldige voetbalthriller kon zich geen beter einde wensen
7308547 maar hoe denk jij nu over buitenspel in deze situatie
7308548 als ik ooit zeker geweest ben van mijn zaak dan was het wel in dit geval
7308549 hebt u hier ook weer vertraagde en stilstaande beelden van
7308550 nou moet u opletten als molenaar die bal naar voren schiet ben ik nog op onze eigen helft kijkt u maar ik doe zelfs nog een stapje terug en nu passeren wij de bal en ik dus ongeveer tegelijk de middenlijn maar al zou dat niet het geval zijn dan hoeft het nog geen off side te zijn want sta ik nog op mijn eigen helft op het moment dat de bal de voet van molenaar verlaat dan doet het er helemaal niets meer toe als ik bij het aannemen van de bal op de vijandelijke helft zou staan er is hier dan ook geen schijntje van buitenspel maar dit is met die stilstaande beelden natuurlijk heel wat makkelijker te beoordelen dan in de wedstrijd maar ik ben erg blij dat alle twijfel nu weg is
7308551 ik moest natuurlijk wel verschrikkelijk hard lopen maar u moet wel bedenken dat ik natuurlijk veel frisser was dan al die anderen en u ziet ik had nog tijd voor dat malligheidje
7308552 zo heren met het oog op de tijd gaan wij dit deel van ons programma nu afsluiten ik heb nog n vraag wat denk je cees heb je jezelf nu een vaste plaats in de hoofdmacht van ajax veroverd
7308553 nou als ik het voor het zeggen had zou ik best nog een poosje willen wachten ik moet nog zo verschrikkelijk veel leren en als mijn prestaties worden vergeleken met wat er vandaag allemaal gebeurd is dan kan het toch alleen maar tegenvallen zon dag maak ik natuurlijk nooit meer mee en bovendien iedereen kent mij nu en terecht of niet ik zal bij een volgende gelegenheid heus wel in de gaten worden gehouden door de tegenpartij als jong onbekend broekie was ik vandaag zo vrij als een vogeltje in de lucht maar ik houd mij helemaal vast aan meneer cruyff die weet heus wel wanneer hij mij brengen moet
7308554 luister eens mart het is nu zeker niet het moment om daar al speculaties over te doen laat ik dit zeggen wij jij en ik zouden samen best een elftal kunnen samenstellen van allemaal veebelovende jonge voetballers die te vroeg gelanceerd zijn dat zijn nu nog steeds verdienstelijke voetballers maar niet de toppers die zij beloofden te worden en die spiegel wil ik cees en mijzelf graag voorhouden
7308555 jij kunt ze veel beter opnoemen dan ik ik brand mij niet aan koud water
7308556 dat doen we dan bij een andere gelegenheid nog wel eens mag ik het gesprek hiermee afsluiten of heeft n van jullie nog een opmerking
7308557 ik wou nog graag even zeggen dat ik vind dat er toch teveel eer op mij afstraalt ik was toevallig de doelpuntenmaker maar het aandeel van de anderen is net zo groot als ik bedenk wat er aan die drie doelpunten bijvoorbeeld voor werk van keje molenaar vooraf ging dan had hij hier net zo goed kunnen zitten en eigenlijk t hele team
7308558 nou leuk dat je dat nog even zegt en ik begrijp goed wat je bedoelt maar jij was nu toevallig de opvallendste dus hebben we jou maar genomen zo bedankt voor jullie fijne inbreng en nu dus aan de slag met de voetjes
7308559 schei maar uit t heeft mij al kratten vol cola en pils gekost op het veld van de voetbalclub in ons dorp staat ook zon gatenbord voor een gulden krijg je een bal en dan spelen wij een rondje om een drankje nou ik kan er letterlijk geen bal van
7308560 ach we zullen wel zien cees maak je maar niet bezorgd als ik zie hoe moeilijk dit spel is voor voetballers met een geweldige schuttersreputatie dan hoef jij niet bang te zijn om af te gaan de spelregels kennen jullie eerst ieder drie schoten op het onderste daarna drie op het bovenste gat en wie de meeste goaltjes heeft die wint de pot wie begint er jij johan
7308561 misschien kan ik hem de kunst nog een beetje afkijken
7308562 je moet proberen de bal heel even onder het hart te raken niet te hard natuurlijk maar toch wel zo hard dat de bal bij het stuiteren rechtdoor gaat en niet opzij springt
7308563 nou cees laat zien wat je kan en probeer de oude meester te evenaren
7308564 jij hebt de zaak even mooi in de maling genomen alle drie nota bene wat zeg jij daar nu van johan
7308565 ik vind het schitterend maar het verbaast mij niet eens zo erg t is voor een groot deel een kwestie van zelfvertrouwen en daar heeft cees vandaag blijkbaar een flinke portie van te pakken gekregen
7308566 cees nu wel iets meer onder het hart h mik maar een twintig centimeter boven het gat als je niet te hard schiet zakt hij er dan precies door probeer het maar niet met een strakke bal want dan kun je nooit zuiver genoeg mikken
7308567 als die laatste mis zou gaan ik hoop het natuurlijk niet hoor cees dan heb ik in ieder geval twee finalisten voor de eindstrijd
7308568 en nou t koppie dr bij houden cees als je het twee keer kan dan kun je het ook een derde keer die eerste twee waren perfect geraakt en is die derde wel mis wel dan is er nog geen man over boord dan knokken wij samen aan het eind van het seizoen nog een keer om die auto
7308569 mannen ik wil graag nog wat nababbelen maar eerst moet ik het programma even afsluiten wel dames en heren meisjes en jongens ik geloof niet teveel te zeggen als ik beweer dat er vanmiddag geschiedenis is geschreven voetbalgeschiedenis en televisiegeschiedenis dit is nu waar wij televisiemensen van dromen en vandaag is zon droom werkelijkheid geworden dankzij een 17 jarige scholier en zijn onvolprezen leermeester wij gaan nog gezellig een poosje napraten graag tot de volgende week en bedankt voor het kijken en dag
7308570 t zou eigenlijk abnormaal zijn geweest als je niet even gejankt had wees maar blij dat het meteen gebeurde dan is het er maar uit en anders had je die reactie toch later wel gekregen
7308571 ik wil even wat tegen je zeggen cees wat jij vandaag allemaal meegemaakt hebt dat is onbeschrijfelijk mooi ik heb zoals je weet ook van die hoogtepunten in mijn carri re meegemaakt je denkt een ogenblik dat de wereld aan je voeten ligt en dat je het helemaal gemaakt hebt maar pas op de mooiste dag van je jonge leven tot nu toe heeft ook heel gevaarlijke kanten je moet vooral uitkijken dat je niet alles wat je in je verdere leven tegenkomt afzet tegen die gouden dag van vandaag want dan valt het alleen maar tegen blijf met beide voeten stevig op de grond staan en bedenk vooral dat je vandaag wel een ontzaglijke portie mazzel hebt gehad een ons geluk is meer dan een pond verstand en bezwijk niet voor de vele verleidingen die je de komende week al zult tegenkomen ik weet dat je gelukkig uit een verstandige en nuchtere omgeving komt en daarom denk ik ook wel dat je er tegen bestand zult zijn maar kijk uit en wat er vandaag allemaal gepasseerd is dat is in onze ogen een kapitale gebeurtenis maar in verhouding tot wat er zich allemaal vandaag in de wereld aan blijde en droeve gebeurtenissen heeft afgespeeld natuurlijk van heel heel ondergeschikte betekenis ik hoop dat je begrijpt dat ik je plezier natuurlijk niet wil vergallen neem mij deze ontboezeming maar niet kwalijk ik moest het even kwijt zo en nou gaan we naar huis

7308586 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7308587 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7308588 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy

7308599 we have to think about the patient and not be dogmatic about it
7308600 and thats the problem in canada were very dogmatic about public and private and you know this public and private system exists everywhere in the world except three countries canada cuba and north korea
7308601 for example a surgeon could do 90 per cent of his surgery in the public system but if theres no operating room available then he could do maybe five or 10 per cent of his practice in the private sector
7308602 but then you dont need to lose that surgeon in the public sector because hes doing a small part of his practice in the private sector
7308603 we have a show stopper here this strong young man is clueless in regards to his looks and abilities which makes a even more charming he is sporty and playful and prefers loud chewable toys the most he rolls over easily and shows an inquisitive quiet side periodically
7308604 the line that separates a good poker player from a winning poker player is the willingness to constantly learn observe and adapt
7308605 successful poker players survive because of self control and eyes that carefully read each opponent do not bother playing if you do not have self control and is impatient you will only lose self control is about the art of suppressing your emotions so you can carefully analyze the exact situation you are in which in turn will help you make wise decisions
7308606 at the mit media lab pentland leads a team of about a dozen researchers who have developed a range of small wearable electronic devices that can easily and accurately gather the kinds of social data needed for such analyses these devices track not just the physical location of the people who wear them but also the finer details of a persons movement in effect his or her body language and several distinct features of his or her vocal behavior and by taking note of peoples proximity to others and the patterns of their movement the team can foster new insights into collective human behavior the subtle differences between effective and ineffective teams and the structures and incentives that either improve or block collaboration

7308618 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7308619 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference

7308627 you cant just walk in there pay your money and get your degree
7308628 the purpose of accreditation is to provide public assurance of educational quality and institutional integrity

7308630 if attention is not paid there is the possibility they will be destroyed
7308631 floods and rain in spring and snow in winter all end up around the minarets
7308632 there are serious challenges as regards training infrastructure and all these issues after all afghanistan has faced constant conflict for the past three decades
7308633 the reform of the judiciary has gone really slowly norways foreign department has sent judges and state lawyers and prison officials to train the afghans but few other countries have contributed trainers for any part of the judiciary at all then there is a challenge as regards international jurisprudence and the afghan constitution which are not completely compatible as well as local traditions the elder councils and sharia laws
7308634 justice sector reform is central to efforts by the afghans and the international community to build a sustainable state founded upon the rule of law and a democratic system of governance but progress is affected by the security situation
7308635 last year almost a thousand policemen were killed in attacks by bandits and the taliban and if the mainly bandit attacks on help convoys across the country now begin to increase it will have an enormous effect on the general situation
7308636 there has been some progress with police reform after the united states stepped in with a teaching course right before christmas that is almost an exact copy of what they did with the afghan army the real delays relate to justice reform by which i mean the criminal justice system the courts the prison service and so on
7308637 in general the approach simply hasnt worked ddr was handed to japan and the police reform was meant to be germanys responsibility the u s took the army italy took justice reform and britain took counter narcotics but the whole process has been inadequately coordinated
7308638 we cant just blame the afghans for lack of progress with the reforms as they were handed a system that had been decided almost before it hit the ground to put it like that what is needed is local institutional capacity building the handing over of responsibility to afghans themselves were not the ones that are going to run the country after all
7308639 if you pump too much money into a post conflict area without having an administration and a bureaucracy capable of handling the funds you just get more corruption and waste
7308640 a precondition for the efforts at justice reform made by norway and the international community is that the afghan authorities actively combat the corruption that exists within the justice sector both centrally and out in the provinces
7308641 i cant be exactly sure what will take place on the ground between the justice minister and the world bank but i do have a feeling that everything is quite closely controlled internationally at the moment there are a lot of funds going into afghanistan but the government is only allowed to control a small percentage the rest is controlled by ngos and international organisations
7308642 as lisbon played at happiness they the refugees played at pretending they would return
7308643 my goal is to make d c the highest performing urban school system in the country
7308644 people want michelle rhee to succeed because no one knows whats going to happen if she doesnt
7308645 i consider it the most difficult job i ever had
7308646 youve had so many varying actors pulling on the school system with such strength that ultimately it went nowhere
7308647 anyone who raises concern is labeled as being for the status quo
7308648 its the fad of the month the flavor of the year
7308649 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7308650 the days when sag harbor was known as a writers colony are over

7308652 kde 4 is still very young it is recommended only for experienced users who can hack their way around problems if you have not upgraded from the installed 4 0 to 4 1 you can try that 4 1 is much better but still it is undergoing active development and at times things dont work right you would just have to see the better bet would be to install kde 3 5 9 you can do that and leave kde 4 1 installed too kde 3 5 9 is very mature and stable you could then use 3 5 9 as your primary gui and occasionally update your 4 1 and check it out when your 4 1 is stable you can switch to it as your primary many very experienced opensuse users are sticking with 3 5 9 until 4 x has had time to mature

7308657 my daughter used to collect bread from other families and my son gathered rubbish from a nearby american base for firewood
7308658 only a few months ago this would not have been possible
7308659 my children go to school now so they wont be illiterate like me
7308660 so i try to sell as much as i can i wish i could focus more on my school but i cant afford to
7308661 so my family could live an honourable life but my boss at the shop paid me very little i tried a few other jobs but finally i decided to beg
7308662 i have always wanted to be a teacher i still have hopes that our government will help the poor like us
7308663 there are thousands of afghan traders around the world and they spend thousands of dollars everyday without thinking but when we approach them about kochah they dont give
7308664 a lot of afghans in the west promise help but few follow through
7308665 i pray for peace in my country all the time because war took everything away from me

7308669 bmw motorsport direktor mario theissen erkl rte gestern dass ihr anteil am team auf 20 prozent ansteigen soll ist das korrekt so
7308670 dass die anteile steigen sollen nein die waren immer bei 20 prozent
7308671 also steigt der anteil von bmw am team nachdem die credit suisse aussteigt
7308672 das ist so es war vorgesehen diese anteile bei der credit suisse ber drei jahre sukzessive auf null zu reduzieren nach den drei jahren ist die credit suisse dann bei einem anteil von null und ich bei 20 prozent
7308673 das geschieht zum jahreswechsel ja aber das ist eine aussage von mario theissen denn ich w rde zu solchen sachen gar nichts sagen
7308674 nach 14 jahren wollen sie also immer noch in der formel 1 involviert sein
7308675 nach 16 jahren 13 und 3 mir gef llt die formel 1 nach wie vor mir gef llt es nach wie vor in diesem umfang wie es f r mich jetzt ist ich werde in diesem jahr zehn rennen besuchen es macht mir freude und solange man mich braucht mach ich gerne mit
7308676 diese aufgaben sind reduziert auf die betreuung von wichtigen g sten das geht in erster linie geht es hier um vorst nde oder es geht um gro e sponsoren
7308677 welche rennen stehen f r sie in diesem jahr noch an
7308678 ich werde sicher monza mitmachen auch shanghai und singapur und als letztes werde ich noch s o paulo mitmachen weil ich hoffe dass wir den dritten platz den wir jetzt fast sicher haben dann definitiv haben
7308679 sind sie optimistisch dass der dritte rang gehalten werden kann
7308680 haben sie einen einfluss auf die fahrerbesetzung f r das n chste jahr
7308681 sicher sind das punkte die man zusammen diskutiert das geh rt auch zur aufgabe wenn das gew nscht ist
7308682 kann das team in diesem jahr noch ein rennen gewinnen
7308683 ja das team kann noch ein rennen gewinnen so wie wir es in montreal gewonnen haben allerdings ist eine gewisse distanz bei der leistung des fahrzeugs zu ferrari und mclaren da da muss dann schon alles stimmen
7308684 was halten sie von den bestrebungen f r das neue reglement f r 2009 sowohl bei der aerodynamik als auch in bezug auf kers
7308685 das reglement wird extrem spannend von der technischen der aerodynamischen seite her kers lasse ich jetzt mal weg das ist eine interessante entwicklung wie weit die funktioniert beim ersten rennen bei allen teams das lasse ich jetzt mal offen das wird sehr interessant sein die aerodynamik ist unglaublich spannend denn wir bekommen komplett neue autos all dieser fl gel oder gefl gel salat verschwindet ja die autos werden ziemlich kahl ausschauen
7308686 nun ist die frage ob es konventionelle fahrzeuge gibt so wie sie waren ohne fl gelchen oder kommt irgendeiner auf die idee was k nnte ich neues konstruieren um wieder zus tzlichen abtrieb zu erzeugen im moment sp rt man da keine anzeichen ich bin gespannt ob irgendein genialer konstrukteur was neues bringt und dann einen vorteil hat
7308687 urspr nglich wollte man eine reduzierung des abtriebs um 50 prozent erreichen jetzt ist von 20 bis 25 prozent die rede k nnen sie dazu etwas sagen
7308688 ich kann zu diesen zahlen gar nichts sagen wir werden das bei den ersten tests sehen auch ob man damit besser berholen kann da bin ich mir nicht sicher wir haben in den vergangenen zehn jahren verschiedenes unternommen um besser berholen zu k nnen es hat lediglich kosten verursacht und berholt wird immer wenig nicht weniger aber immer noch zu wenig
7308689 ellos se han detenido por las olimpiadas pero despu s que ellas finalicen nosotros no sabemos que har n

7308694 ellos construyen los caminos ellos construyen el tren a lhasa pero ellos construyen para los chinos no para los tibetanos
7308695 ellos env an tibetanos a la escuela pero entonces no hay trabajos excepto para los n mades y granjeros los trabajos van para los chinos esto es lo que siento cuando observo las olimpiadas porque en la televisi n los chinos sonr en para el resto del mundo pero detr s ellos hacen mucho mal aqu por eso no puedo apoyar al equipo de china china es astuta como un zorro

7308706 i loved it in midfield but a job had to be done in defence
7308707 these were men who had been sentenced and found guilty by the supreme court walking around freely

7308710 there are difficulties were rebuilding institutions including our justice institutions and there are shortcomings but the president and the government are committed to the rule of law on all equally

7308982 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7308983 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7308984 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7308985 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7308986 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7308987 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7308988 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7308989 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

7308992 last week there was much excitement over the news that an independent ticket featuring michael bloomberg and ron paul would be placed on the ballot in virginia this was eventually shot down because the ticket was to be replaced by the constitution partys ticket
7308993 now in louisiana a similar but more exciting thing is happening

7309001 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7309002 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7309003 our studies have predicted a specific 3 dimensional shape displayed by a key protein that interacts with telomeres
7309004 this prediction has now provided us with a crucial tool that has propelled forward our studies of this protein
7309005 without est1 telomerase cannot get to the ends of chromosomes and thus telomeres shorten
7309006 the recent increase in the ability to predict protein structure is now permitting detailed analysis of many proteins including proteins like est3 whose function had been mysterious
7309007 this is surprising because tpp1 is not a subunit of the telomerase complex
7309008 what we now propose that this particular protein fold which both est3 and tpp1 exhibit is uniquely suited to the telomere
7309009 i dont think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees

7309026 which is good because people dont really think about delaware its like dela where
7309027 but im still not sure on obama i dont really know about him
7309028 i just think hes a sincere and down to earth guy
7309029 the only negative about him really is he speaks sometimes before he thinks of the consequences

7309031 aware of allegations that the engagement in the shindand district of herat province friday may have resulted in civilian casualties
7309032 coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
7309033 expressed his condolences to the people affected in the airstrike
7309034 all efforts of the afghan government to avoid civilian casualties have not yielded any positive results and our innocent countrymen are still killed in anti terrorism operations
7309035 we are appalled by this cruel abduction of journalists and call for the immediate release of our colleagues who are being held captive because of their noble work for somali people
7309036 she has to be on the front lines and she has to be with the people to tell their story and the humanitarian side of everything was is huge for amanda to bring that to the light so that people can help
7309037 i heard a voice ordering them to turn the car in a different direction
7309038 my brother in a low tone was trying not to answer my inquiries but made me understood that they were caught in a difficult situation i realized that things had changed and then their voices disappeared
7309039 wherever she is right now i know that shes keeping a positive attitude because shes an innately positive person
7309040 i dont want to use the word fearless but she is a courageous person of course theres apprehension and she did speak about that but she never really used the term fear
7309041 she said she was drawn to the passion of the people who were in these zones in other words if youre in a zone of conflict nothing is taken for granted and you live each moment like it was a lifetime of experience
7309042 she is an intelligent caring and adventurous professional who was well aware of the dangers of the regions she frequented
7309043 she was also aware that her audience was keenly interested in her world perspective and she worked bravely to bring them that perspective
7309044 y ou can whet ones appetite but you eat at home
7309045 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7309046 con el cuchillo en la mano el oficial que parec a un oso mir a yamamoto y le sonri burlonamente a n ahora recuerdo aquella sonrisa a n ahora se me aparece en sue os jam s podr olvidarla y se puso manos a la obra los soldados sujetaron a yamamoto por manos y rodillas y el oficial mongol fue desoll ndolo minuciosamente con el cuchillo en verdad lo desollaba como si pelara un melocot n no pude enfrentarme a la escena cerr los ojos pero al cerrarlos los soldados mongoles me golpearon con las culatas de sus fusiles abriera los ojos o los cerrara de cualquier modo o a su voz al principio lo soport estoicamente en silencio pero a la mitad empez a lanzar alaridos de dolor unos alaridos que no parec an de este mundo el hombre primero le hizo con un cuchillo un r pido corte en el hombro derecho luego fue desollando el brazo derecho de arriba a abajo lo fue desollando despacio con cuidado casi con amor tal como hab a dicho el oficial ruso aquello cab a calificarlo de arte de no ser por los alaridos tal vez hubiera llegaso a pensar que ni siquiera dol a pero los alaridos de yamamoto hablaban de la monstruosidad del dolor que lo acompa aba la piel del brazo derecho estuvo poco despu s completamente levantada y se hab a convertido en una especie de fina pel cula el desollador la entreg al soldado que estaba a su lado ste la prendi con la punta de los dedos la extendi y fue d ndole la vuelta mostr ndola a los dem s de la piel segu a goteando sangre el oficial desollador pas entonces al brazo izquierdo repiti la misma operaci n le levant la piel de las dos piernas le cort el pene y los test culos le cort las orejas luego desoll la cabeza la cara todo el cuerpo yamamoto perdi el conocimiento volvi a recuperarlo y lo perdi de nuevo inconsciente los alaridos cesaban al recobrar la conciencia los alaridos volv an pero la voz fue debilitando cada vez m s y al final se apag yo mientras tanto vomit muchas veces al final ya no ten a nada que vomitar pero segu vomitando el oficial mongol que parec a un oso extendi la piel del tronco de yamamoto desollada limpiamente de una pieza incluso estaban los pezones cosa tan siniestra como aqu lla ni la hab a visto antes ni la he vuelto a ver jam s alguien se la llev y la puso a secar como una s bana y el cad ver de yamamoto un amasijo de carne roja y sanguinolenta al que le hab an arrancado toda la piel qued all tirado lo m s lastimoso era la cara entre la carne roja dos grandes globos oculares blancos miraban con fijeza la boca de dientes desnudos estaba abierta de par en par como si a n gritara al desprenderse la nariz s lo hab an quedado unos peque os agujeros el suelo era un mar de sangre
7309047 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7309048 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7309049 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7309050 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7309051 we have decided to renew marcos sennas contract for another year as he is without doubt a very important player a player that villarreal needs in the squad to keep growing
7309052 and for that reason we have improved his contract and raised the buy out clause to 100 million all parties are clear on this matter and everyone is very satisfied
7309053 i have always stated my desire to stay at villarreal and it makes me very happy to have my contract extended for three years
7309054 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7309055 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7309056 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7309057 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7309058 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7309059 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7309060 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7309061 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7309062 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7309063 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7309064 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7309065 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7309066 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7309067 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7309068 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7309069 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7309070 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7309071 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7309072 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7309073 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7309074 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7309075 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7309076 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7309077 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7309078 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7309079 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7309080 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7309081 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7309082 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7309083 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7309084 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7309085 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7309086 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7309087 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7309088 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7309089 because the onset of symptoms of listeriosis can occur up to 70 days after contaminated food is consumed it is expected that the number of confirmed and suspected cases will continue to increase over the next several weeks
7309090 tragically our products have been linked to illness and loss of life
7309091 to those people who are ill and to the families who have lost loved ones i offer my deepest and sincerest sympathies
7309092 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7309093 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7309094 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7309095 the grenade was launched into a crowd of people at the wedding ceremony
7309096 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7309097 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7309098 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7309099 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7309100 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7309101 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7309102 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7309103 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7309104 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7309105 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7309106 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7309107 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7309108 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7309109 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7309110 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7309111 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7309112 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7309113 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7309114 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7309115 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7309116 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7309117 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
7309118 include that drilling let it compete and see where we come down on it and if that in fact is a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7309119 according to all our information they have not withdrawn in the manner agreed
7309120 we cant just go back to normal as it is
7309121 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7309122 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7309123 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7309124 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7309125 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7309126 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7309127 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7309128 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7309129 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7309130 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7309131 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7309132 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7309133 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7309134 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7309135 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7309136 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7309137 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7309138 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7309139 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7309140 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7309141 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7309142 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7309143 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7309144 releasing even a portion of this carbon into the atmosphere in the form of methane or carbon dioxide would have an significant impact on earths climate
7309145 its scary for people who are in the restaurant and it effects the economy of oakland
7309146 its tough to predict when these guys are going to hit
7309147 i think we actually need more investigators i think the chief should put more resources into investigating
7309148 el presidente lvaro uribe confirm su presencia en el pr ximo encuentro de la empresa privada
7309149 esta noche ponemos fin a 16 d as gloriosos que recordaremos para siempre gracias al pueblo de china a todos los maravillosos voluntarios y al comit organizador con estos juegos el mundo aprendi m s de china y china aprendi m s del mundo
7309150 estrellas que lo fueron en juegos pasados han vuelto a deleitarnos
7309151 sois verdaderos modelos nos hab is mostrado el poder unificador del deporte el esp ritu ol mpico vive entre adversarios de pa ses en conflicto mantened ese esp ritu vivo cuando regres is a vuestras casas
7309152 y ahora de acuerdo con la tradici n declaro clausurados los juegos de la xxix olimpiada y convoco a la juventud del mundo para que acudan a londres de aqu en cuatro a os para celebrar los juegos de la xxx olimpiada
7309153 deportistas de 204 pa ses y regiones han competido en el esp ritu ol mpico han mostrado su gran perseverancia han dado lo mejor de s en un ambiente deportivo y han conseguido magn ficos resultados batiendo 38 r cords mundiales
7309154 nosotros creemos que es posible avanzar en negociaciones con bloques y frentes y ofrecerles una salida digna venimos haciendo un an lisis muy cuidadoso de la situaci n de hecho hemos tenido contactos con algunos mandos importantes de frentes y bloques de la guerrilla tanto de las farc como del eln y vemos que es viable avanzar en esas desmovilizaciones

7309356 xy ist ja soooooooooooo toll und kann so toll tanzen gitarre spielen jonglieren etc
7309357 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7309358 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7309359 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7309360 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7309361 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7309362 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7309363 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7309364 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7309365 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7309366 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7309367 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7309368 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7309369 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7309370 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7309371 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7309372 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country
7309373 the t shirts are really nice but unfortunately they put this bleep on the back
7309374 anakku mari kita bicara tentang cinta cinta apa yang kau miliki
7309375 oh my god ini ciptaanmu sungguh cantiknya ini kebaikanmu yang kau sematkan dalam dirinya
7309376 inikah yang kau mau melangkah di jalan mu hanyalah engkau yang kutuju pegang erat tanganku bimbing langkah kakiku aku hilang arah tanpa hadir mu dalam gelapnya malam hariku
7309377 bahwa lagu itu bentuk ibadah umat nasrani sebagai persembahan terbaik untuk tuhan allah
7309378 penting untuk kau ingat bahwa yang memberikan ujian adalah yang memberikan juga semua pilihan terbaik pada kita
7309379 hebat sekali dia sehingga allah layak memberikan ujian itu padanya dan beruntunglah dia karena dia mendapat kesempatan untuk naik tingkat
7309380 we will have to work on our own to stave off the danger nobody will come to our rescue not even the islamic world we will have to depend on our muscle
7309381 wanted to go beyond iraq in dealing with wmd proliferation mentioning in particular saudi arabia iran north korea and pakistan
7309382 no longer a bulwark against falling dominoes in afghanistan pakistan hopes to portray itself as a moderate islamic state that can buffer extremist iran chaotic afghanistan and an uncertain central asia
7309383 pakistans decade long reputation as the epicenter for three major internal security upheavals in indias state of jammu and kashmir afghanistan and tajikistan all these conflicts involve fundamentalist devout who have been clandestinely trained and supported by pakistans religious parties or its military
7309384 partially because he doesnt have the capacity to break it down since he and many of his military colleagues created this fire
7309385 besides their obvious repercussions in central asia and afghanistan these struggles could have potentially spill over effects on india with the worlds second largest muslim population and china with its restive turkik muslim minorities
7309386 pakistan is next on the list given close historical links between elements in its security services and al qaeda
7309387 aimed at protecting the united states from wmd attacks would identify pakistan and north korea as the leading perils and put iraq in a rather distant third place
7309388 with anti americanism intensifying throughout the region it is not hard to imagine these officers providing the militants with some of pakistans wmd weapons and technology on the other hand the current leadership in iraq has no such ties with islamic extremists on the contrary saddam has been a life long enemy of the militant islamists and they view him in an equally hostile manner
7309389 countries who pose a greater threat to american interests than iraq yet whom were happy to cozy up to
7309390 poses more threat to the united states than does the situation in iraq
7309391 the best person to work with we ought to be helping him to have better control over his country the united states and india would suffer greatly if pakistan fails
7309392 an uncritical acceptance of the koran as the final manifesto of god
7309393 promising aspirations but there are also troubling aspects of this crucial document
7309394 the time is right for the international community to weigh in this constitution must provide an enduring promise to all the afghan people that their most basic freedoms are inalienable not to be granted or withdrawn easily by a government its courts or its religious leaders
7309395 regime in kabul and the integrity of pakistan could be threatened
7309396 clearing pakistani territory of foreign militants who are pursuing a global jihad
7309397 even those pakistanis who until recently sympathized with the struggles of fellow muslims under oppression for example those of the kashmiris palestinians and chechens are beginning to recognize that the methods of the jihadis are a threat to global order
7309398 do not want their country to be subjected to an international military operation like the ones in afghanistan and iraq
7309399 im determined to punish this tribe and make them an example
7309400 its painful as a coach and painful as a player

7309456 the team did a fantastic job today and i am really pleased with these past 5 days at the eneco tour im right on target
7309457 i feel im on track and racing here has been good for my moral now i want to win sprints in the vuelta id also like to win the paris tours classic for the first time and then there is the world championship road race in italy in my opinion the varese route isnt any harder than in madrid 2005 when boonen won im confident i can ride well
7309458 it was a long day for me because i dont usually go in breakaways but it was worth it now ive got the leaders jersey this is a protour race and so its pretty important i dont think i can win the race because of the final time trial but with boasson hagen in second just behind me the team is in the best possible position for the final stages
7309459 im still feeling good and so hopefully i can win the sprint on monday as well and take another stage victory

7309506 i have always stated my desire to stay at villarreal and it makes me very happy to have my contract extended for three years
7309507 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7309508 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7309509 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted

7309523 there have been times in earth history when atmospheric co2 concentrations were 5 10 even 15 times the present concentration and the climate of earth still supported animals not unlike ourselves

7309525 for most of earths history the globe has been warmer than it has been for the last 200 years it has rarely been cooler

7309528 while some say the sky is falling and others make bold predictions about the future of our independent film the truth is that no one knows for sure what the future holds
7309529 the biggest mistake independent filmmakers and distributors and multi national conglomerates have made is trying to be something theyre not
7309530 in baseball terms indie films have always hit for average after a few towering homers everyone started trying to swing for the fences
7309531 indie filmmakers have always worked and should continue to work on the margins
7309532 the world has changed so much since many of our organizations were founded
7309533 at afs we have tried to focus on evolving into a mature fundraising organization without losing our soul it can make for internal culture clashes but id prefer that to extinction it is not necessarily a disaster when an organization goes under or two organizations merge it can be an opportunity to let go of programs that have outlived their usefulness
7309534 years ago i predicted that this could happen as the media landscape began to change and felt that the only way organizations could survive was to form partnerships or merge or configure themselves in whatever way they could to continue to do relevant work
7309535 responding to the current needs of media artists is for me what matters most if the san francisco film society can provide services which enable work to be produced for me that is the most important consideration i work for an organization which just went through a huge change with the goal of doing more as a merged organization than we could do if we were two separate organizations
7309536 there are always bumps in the road in any arts community but this is a lot
7309537 a two way communication with the constituents a few of these organizations made quick decisive moves without communicating to their core users consequently the constituents staged loud and pervasive revolts calling the decision makers out on the carpet on this point i commend film arts foundations board for taking the time to communicate with their shareholders negotiate with the san francisco film society to preserve key programs for filmmakers and ensure the ongoing health of the filmmaking community
7309538 for which faf served as a fiscal sponsor indie consultant and producer
7309539 after leaving faf in 1993 i continued to consider it one of the vital centers for indie filmmakers in the u s
7309540 over time it was increasingly distressing to hear of certain programs being cut back or eliminated its pointless to go into the politics of it all at this time the technology of the indie world has radically changed and the way business is done and the way work is now distributed exhibited and made accessible has been in great flux
7309541 the most important thing to me the fate of the members and their being able to continue to enjoy needed services including those who have projects with non profit fiscal sponsorship is that they are being offered continuity by having their membership atomatically transferred to the san francisco film society
7309542 they will now be safely under a very strong umbrella strengthened immeasureably in recent years by the leadership of graham leggat whose intelligence and acumen i have admired for years and whose head and heart are in the right place
7309543 shifting focus from catering to film connoisseurs to serving the entire bay area filmmaking community is a jarring transition as the ed of an organization that endeavors to cater to both i speak from experience when i comment that attempting to serve the needs of filmmakers while cultivating and serving the needs of film lovers demands the patience balance tenacity and strategic planning of philippe petit one errant breeze could lead to disaster
7309544 provides the opportunity for sffs to revive what was once a strong commitment to local indies the kind of commitment that faf has been unable to deliver in recent years without question the bay area film community deserves both first rate advocacy and unwavearing support
7309545 sffs will quickly learn that local indies dont sit quietly in their seats waiting for the movie to begin they will be phoning emailing and showing up at the door demanding that their needs be met by their new guardian and sffs had better be ready to provide that service
7309546 ultimately this is up to the filmmakers to decide if theres a legitimate demand someone will serve it conversely organizations that are failing are doing so because they offer services that are no longer valued supported or they cannot find funding to cover to cost of the costly slate of services on the menu
7309547 rather than attempting to serve a filmmakers every need an information age non profit organization needs to be able to direct a filmmaker to the source of services they seek the organization and its constituents are better served if you identify quality strategic partners who can provide the services better than you can its a win win win
7309548 filmmakers should speak up more about what they really need and what they are willing to pay for
7309549 as it stands now the bulk of our services are paid for by private donors via celebrity events and government grants i would feel more secure if we had a wider base of smaller donors how do you convert people who value independent film into valuing their local media arts organization and paying their dues
7309550 very early on i realized that to succeed a non profit must function like a business
7309551 too many aging and ailing non profits are clinging to romantic ideas too many arts organizations possess big hearts and want to be all things to all people yet we lack the deep pockets to do this
7309552 every non profit must acknowledge the economic realities of the market and adjust accordingly
7309553 you have to be brutally honest you cannot afford to be romantic or nostalgic or you face the very real possibility that youll join company with has beens and also rans
7309554 how media arts organizations move forward into the 21st century is an important question
7309555 weve all discussed the need to shed the old models
7309556 i think this is a particularly difficult time because we dont totally understand what the future will be and now we hear so much about endings and closings
7309557 the familiar beloved models may go away but exciting new models of communication will replace them and for me thats what matters most
7309558 media npos need to be in touch with the needs of their members honor the traditions of the past but dont cling to them and be flexible enough to move to the next service the field demands
7309559 in the midst of these confusing times we must reassure our core that management is on solid ground the finances should be transparent and we must realize that service to our members and the field are why we exist
7309560 i will become a member of the sffs immediately to show my support for what i trust will be a very fruitful coalescence of forces that will enrich the overall american independent film scene

7309589 she follows him around the world having his kids and living everywhere that he travels to and never once complained about the amount of time he was away from home while shes bringing up his kids
7309590 and then he just walks out for another younger woman

7309592 no but the boys are very excited by the walk
7309593 theyre right into their motorbikes and i sent them a shot of the police on the bikes there they loved it
7309594 the only problem i have had since doing sensing murder is a phone call at 1am from a male who talked about one of the cases
7309595 he said he watched me on the programme and to keep my mouth shut as you know too much
7309596 i dont let people like that frighten me as i will still carry on with the cases even though some cases are with gangs and drug rings
7309597 i know i am being looked after otherwise spirit a supernatural being she says helps her in her crime solving would not let me do the work
7309598 after filming that episode i ended up very sick in hospital with water on my lungs
7309599 i went over to the other side and she agnes was there i had taken on what she had passed over with as she had drowned in a ditch
7309600 the hospital could not understand that in such a short space of time i had become so ill
7309601 every case i work on upsets me and some are worse then others when i go into a case i go and give it all 100 percent
7309602 when i come back home i have to work it through in my own mind and i just want to be left alone i find my own peace with the person i am working with
7309603 i never talk about the case and my family and friends understand that

7309619 the next two types of mentum that we must be aware of produce the best results when they are as equally balanced as possible one is called buttmentum buttmentum is the theory of the downward force produced against the human body that is in direct proportion to the mass of the humans butt people with large butts must contend with a stronger force of buttmentum than those who have smaller butts
7309620 after six years of working out i have honed my buttocks to a razor sharp edge i am in awe of my ungodly buttmentum as are the villagers i can open beer bottles soothe angry mobs and perform invasive surgery with this thing
7309621 well yeah we have to sell ourselves but for the highest price so that we can use this symbolic resource to propagandize our stuff
7309622 this very important discovery not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7309623 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7309624 because there are already drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7309625 wir waren nie russen aber die menschen neigen dazu immer alles ber einen kamm zu scheren wir aber wollen bayern sein

7309630 we are extremely pleased with the results from the drilling of the eagle well and believe it could ultimately become one of the largest producers in the valentine field which is well known for its prolific gas production
7309631 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7309632 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy

7309639 the united states has 2 trillion barrels of oil shale
7309640 this is more than seven times the amount of crude oil reserves found in saudi arabia and is enough to meet current u s demand for over 250 years
7309641 the u s could completely end its dependence on opec by 2020
7309642 even a moderate estimate of 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil from oil shale in the green river formation is three times greater than the proven oil reserves of saudi arabia
7309643 i just loved it i enjoyed it 100 lots of duels lots of energy
7309644 ive got to be honest i signed two days ago trained once and today i played and didnt know their names
7309645 during the game i learned their names learned how everyone plays
7309646 it was a lot of fun i wanted to play an intelligent game and try to do my best for the team
7309647 i loved it in midfield but a job had to be done in defence
7309648 thats why the trainer manager mark hughes took me because he can count on me in different positions
7309649 vincent kompany was excellent stephen ireland came in and had a real effect
7309650 there were a lot of positives today daniel sturridge got on the scoresheet which we wanted him to do
7309651 you saw one purchase today kompany that cost a significant amount of money and well be back in the market trying to sign good players

7309658 the first world war was not won by one country alone allied forces from around the world came together and fought alongside one another for a common goal
7309659 this year as the world marks the 90th anniversary of the end of the first world war and as the number of veterans from the first world war grows smaller we unite once more with a common goal to never forget

7309661 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
7309662 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7309663 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7309664 the prime minister did make it clear to china that she should be released

7309667 the militants believe that the shiite officials are from the badr militia who are trained and strongly directed by iran with of course the knowledge of the americans
7309668 the militants now sahwa members kept blocking import of goods from iran
7309669 they shot the shopkeepers who dealt with them so it was rare to see iranian chocolate or anything else with the partial government control by the shiite especially in the last six months shopkeepers are now allowed to deal in iranian goods
7309670 iran enjoys influence through the men of the united iraqi alliance in the baghdad government as represented by the supreme islamic iraqi council siic and the dawa party
7309671 the governor made a deal to import cooking oil from iran at a very high price that has never been seen before
7309672 i think the iranian influence will remain as long as there are such men as the governor raad rashid jawad in the province
7309673 the province was and still is the worst because of this corrupt administration
7309674 the iraqi government gives 5 million dollars per month to the iranian side to cover the cost of the electricity to diyala province
7309675 we dont have a representative government here or in baghdad because of the heavy iranian influence
7309676 that influence favours only those who support them and injures those of us who do not
7309677 the badr militia and all their political and religious leaders entered iraq on the backs of the american tanks
7309678 until the americans came there was no way they badr and iranian backed politicians and religious leaders could set one foot in this country
7309679 friedman tells stories well with a keen eye for wars absurdities and his own fading illusions of wars glory
7309680 emotionally honest friedman allows readers to experience things alongside him rather than merely gasp in awe at his heroics or sit clucking in judgment
7309681 a time to lead confirms the rewarding benefits of military service at a time when such service is experiencing considerable strain it also includes a comprehensive description of americas current national imperatives which deserve serious consideration
7309682 this is a primer on leadership forged in battle and by decades of experience this isnt just a book its a manual for leading people and living a good life
7309683 whip smart sassy with a mouth as foul as a sailors 28 year old sergeant kayla williams tells what its like to be a female soldier in iraq

7309685 we have decided to renew marcos sennas contract for another year as he is without doubt a very important player a player that villarreal needs in the squad to keep growing
7309686 and for that reason we have improved his contract and raised the buy out clause to 100 million all parties are clear on this matter and everyone is very satisfied
7309687 i have always stated my desire to stay at villarreal and it makes me very happy to have my contract extended for three years
7309688 often misrepresented as a cow town stuck in the middle of flyover country
7309689 what i tell people is that had we known then what we know now we wouldve never bid for the convention

7309691 minty could have found food in vegetable gardens or food scraps but shes used to having her food put on for her so its likely she wouldnt have had anything to eat since she ran away
7309692 she hasnt gelled totally back with the others yet theres been no cuddles but they seem happy to have her back and havent been aggressive
7309693 one must learn to love and go through a good deal of suffering to get to it and the journey is always towards the other soul
7309694 she had not known the weight until she felt the freedom
7309695 i was just getting ready to send you a message i put my shirt on and suddenly i was surrounded by you
7309696 i couldnt figure out what had happened or why i was suddenly smelling you so strongly it was very strange
7309697 if im still enjoying it and doing well then why not
7309698 itll be the first time ive spent a good chunk of time there for a while
7309699 im looking forward to it being a kiwi at home again
7309700 weve certainly only got ourselves to blame four goals and four errors really
7309701 its disappointing i think we were brighter and we were better tonight than last week but you feel more disappointed that you got nothing for it
7309702 we had quite a few chances so were certainly creating them and to score two at home that should be good enough to win
7309703 its only two down though weve got 19 to go
7309704 i thought we played better football yet were on the end of a 4 2 thumping which is very disappointing
7309705 we were well aware of their strengths but i guess we just didnt deal with it as well as we should have
7309706 in those conditions we tried to bypass the midfield and once we got that happening we knew wed cause a lot of trouble and thats exactly how it worked out
7309707 i can fill in a bunch of boxes with letters
7309708 there was a very small number of painted vehicles and we understand quite a few of them went through to queenstown for skiing
7309709 its quite clear that it the undie 500 is seen as a magnet
7309710 its much improved on last year our belief has been student behaviour is improving but its still far from acceptable
7309711 its a booze trip it does have something to do with it
7309712 we had done all we could to distance ourselves from this years trip
7309713 there is no doubt the combined efforts of all these agencies resulted in reduced overall levels of disorder
7309714 in the end we remain dependent upon the responsibility of individuals involved
7309715 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7309716 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7309717 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7309718 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7309719 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7309720 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7309721 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7309722 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7309723 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7309724 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7309725 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7309726 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7309727 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7309728 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7309729 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7309730 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7309731 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7309732 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7309733 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7309734 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7309745 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7309746 lets make it real clear im not apologizing for it
7309747 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race

7309749 the gc games convention will be back in leipzig again in 2009
7309750 the industry and visitors are giving us their clear support to continue with the fair in leipzig
7309751 do you think there should be a gc in leipzig in 2009
7309752 anyone who has experienced the enthusiastic mood in the exhibition halls over the last seven years knows this fair belongs in leipzig
7309753 the fairs and conferences in leipzig are becoming increasingly international and attract more and more visitors were pleased with this development i completely agree with the governor of the free state of saxony stanislaw tillich that we will do everything to help this new cultural sector and the gc games convention to achieve further success
7309754 the concept is flexible and the network of the global games industry permits us to be active at different locations after the southeast asian games convention we are now focusing on the north american market

7309764 north korea is no 1 in the world when it comes to uniformity they are uniform beyond belief these kind of traditional synchronized movements result in a sense of beauty we chinese are able to achieve this as well through hard training and strict discipline
7309765 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
7309766 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in two months

7309955 to those of you who think that getting rid of all the weapons will lead to peace i have this to
7309956 its because i smoke three cigars a day and drink a quart of brandy before lunch

7309959 we have made very clear to the un envoy that the mission should not discuss the upcoming 2010 elections as the nld does not recognize the military backed constitution
7309960 the un envoy was wasting his time on matters that he was not supposed to deal with
7309961 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7309962 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7309963 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes obamas made a very wise selection
7309964 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties countries
7309965 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done
7309966 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7309967 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor
7309968 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead
7309969 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7309970 joe biden has a long record of experience its in sharp contrast to barack obamas record
7309971 we feel like its a bit of a disguise pick hes trying to disguise hes the most inexperienced candidate in the modern era
7309972 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7309973 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7309974 an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team
7309975 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7309976 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than senator biden
7309977 hes essentially put a middle aged white guy on the ticket and i think it compromises the change message
7309978 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else
7309979 it isnt like there was a staff meeting to say this is the person we were all signed up for the text messages like you
7309980 he brings experience he brings maturity hes his own man who can tell you youre wrong with a smile on his face
7309981 i like the combination of youth and experience hes a senior just like me
7309982 hes done what he said he was going to hes added someone whos not a yes man
7309983 it doesnt mean that he and she wont still be confidantes or that she might not end up in his cabinet
7309984 i do worry but i do believe that hes got a divine arm of protection around him so lets pray and put it in gods hands

7309986 years ago there were these types of problems but not on this scale
7309987 without a father he was forced to arm himself and to make his own way into the worlds he chose to join and to master
7309988 i think my strength actually comes in my case from the absence of a father at some level i had to raise myself my mother obviously was the dominant influence in my life and i had a stepfather and a grandfather who both participated in raising me and were good men who did good things for me but if i think about how i have been able to navigate some pretty tricky situations in my life it has to do with the fact that i had to learn to trust my own judgment i had to learn to fight for what i wanted
7309989 that will be the aim of much of the pageantry at the democratic convention
7309990 in the saga of ann dunham and her parents the campaign sees a mother lode of votes a biographical narrative to show he understands the economic fears and cultural cues of white middle class voters in swing states
7309991 but because many americans think obama is not what he actually is it has become that
7309992 for obama that is a potential problem particularly in a race that shows ever more signs of being extremely close
7309993 at some point these are issues thoughtful people will need to face head on rather than cede the ground to propagandists who traffic in intolerance and who deprived of the ability to make racial slurs with impunity simply shift their focus to religion
7309994 many have discoursed on what an obama victory could mean for america we would finally be able to see our legacy of slavery segregation and racism in the rearview mirror our kids would grow up thinking of prejudice as a nonfactor in their lives
7309995 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth his defeat would say that when handed a perfect opportunity to put the worst part of our history behind us we chose not to in this event the worlds judgment will be severe and inescapable the united states had its day but in the end couldnt put its own self interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race
7309996 modern campaigns are about flinging 10 things against the wall every day and hoping something sticks everything else from fund raising to advertising paid for by the fund raising to speechmaking to web strategy is in the service of applying that adhesive either to cement the candidates message or muck up the other guys engine with sludge
7309997 thats because memorable lines images gaffes and monikers act like a piece of gum on the bottom of your shoe in the world of marketing sticky branding means intentionally creating an emotional attachment to a consumer product
7309998 like fantasy football and baseball fantasy politics is an exercise in make believe that is intended to keep its players occupied and to make the winners feel good
7309999 the most exhaustive examination of the mccain and obama budget proposals ive found comes from the tax policy center
