3050022 devilfish ulliott is one of the most successful formidable and well known
3050023 i really like the combination of analysis behind the news that gamesindustry biz provides it taps into the brains and emotions of so many industry constituencies developers and publishers of course but also manufacturers government and financial players with so much volatility these days its important to be fully advised as well as informed highly recommended
3050024 but analog is still a rapidly growing part of the semiconductor business
3050025 and there is really only one company that provides a soup to nuts analog system for wireless infrastructure products that company is adi
3050026 digital chips which store data in ones and zeroes operate by differentiating between on and off signals
3050027 analog chips by contrast process gradations and are able to process waveforms such as speech music and video so analog chips create a bridge to the digital world where data is stored and manipulated
3050028 digital chips themselves are ill suited for communicating as digital circuits shrink to ever smaller sizes the value in the analog portion that doesnt scale well continues to rise
3050029 a year ago i would not have recommended analog devices the company was struggling from 2004 to 2007 adi posted a 1 compounded annual growth rate in revenues and earnings per share
3050030 during that time the company was a provider of handset basebands modems inside a phone which really became a commodity business it was also in the pc power management businesses which was also a drag on the overall growth of the company
3050031 the good news is that during the first quarter adi got out of these businesses and has taken steps to move from single digital earning growth to double digit growth adi looks set to deliver double digit growth of 13 five year cagr much ofthat growth is coming from its communications business
3050032 wireless carriers have been upgrading to third generation 3g networks over the past year and many now are focusing their sites on building fourth generation 4g networks as well as wimax networks
3050033 with each move up the idea is to provide higher data rates allowing for more applications to run at once and for higher quality pictures and video as a result i think this stock looks very attractive
3050034 the biggest part of adis analog business is products for its industrial and communications business which account for 72 of revenues within this business adis wireless base station revenues grew significantly over the past year
3050035 manufacturers of base stations which are radio receiver transmitters that serve as the hub of the local wireless network have been td scdma the chinese version of 3g equipment
3050036 i believe the shares should soon be trading at the upper end of their historical trading range i expect adi to generate eps of 2 06 in 2009 at 26 times earnings that would give a price target of 53 per share
3050037 we support breastfeeding but if you cant nurse we recommend breast milk from a milk bank or that you use formula

3050039 this is not a back to nature hippie type movement
3050040 its what savvy moms who know the science are doing to ensure that their baby is getting the best
3050041 when our daughter lauren arrived all i could think was she shouldnt be deprived of breast milk just because shes adopted
3050042 a mothers milk is specific for her baby and changes as the baby grows
3050043 donor milk may also pass along viruses which a baby cant fight because he hasnt received that mothers antibodies
3050044 my first reaction is eww and im a breastfeeding advocate

3050080 mississippi gov haley barbour r said august 4 that he would plug the states 90 million medicaid funding hole by raising taxes on state hospitals barbour wants to raise hospitals gross revenue assessment the tax hospitals pay on the money that flows into their coffers from 0 45 percent to 1 08 percent the increased tax rate would raise 88 million the remaining 2 million would be saved by cutting funds from other services but dont expect the states hospitals to accept this plan lying down the mississippi hospital association filed a lawsuit against the governor in 2005 when he proposed something similar its a good fair deal that taxes the hospitals not our citizens and rightly so barbour said in a press release describing the plan

3050100 since i am not actually a real human being my emotional responses are generally limited to what i have learned to fake so i did not feel shock outrage anger or even bitter resolve theyre very difficult emotions to do convincingly and there was no audience to do them for so why bother but i did feel a slow cold wind from the dark backseat sweep up my spine and blow dry leaves over the floor of my lizard brain
3050101 i thought i would be able to prove my innocence and receive justice which is why i returned to thailand on feb 28 but the situation has deteriorated
3050102 i have also constantly received news that my life is not safe wherever i travel i have to use bulletproof cars this is the result i got from having volunteered to serve the country the king and the people
3050103 such remarks by the former leader could damage the countrys image in its suggestion that we have an unjust judicial system

3050119 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
3050120 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
3050121 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
3050122 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo
3050123 if someone went to the russians and said ok kosovo for iran wed have a deal

3050132 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine
3050133 i decided i didnt want this guy anywhere near a trigger
3050134 if either john mccain or mike huckabee gets the nomination its going to destroy the republican party its going to change it forever be the end of it
3050135 his temper would place this country at risk in international affairs and the world perhaps in danger in my mind that should disqualify him
3050136 it just seems like everything we did john was someplace else
3050137 what happens if he gets angry in crisis in the presidency its the presidents job to negotiate and stay calm i just dont see that he has that quality
3050138 hardheaded is one way to say it arrogant is another way to say it hubristic is another way to say it too proud for his own good is another way to say it its a quality about him that disturbs me
3050139 he is the anti conservative he instinctively sides against conservatives and relishes poking them in the eye
3050140 john mccain is bob dole minus the charm conservatism and youth
3050141 what happens if he gets angry in crisis in the presidency its difficult enough to be a negotiator but its almost impossible when youre the type of guy whos so angry at anybody who doesnt do what he wants its the presidents job to negotiate and stay calm i just dont see that he has that quality
3050142 no dissent no opinion to the contrary however reasonable will be entertained hardheaded is one way to say it arrogant is another way to say it hubristic is another way to say it too proud for his own good is another way to say it its a quality about him that disturbs me
3050143 he is the anti conservative he instinctively sides against conservatives and relishes poking them in the eye
3050144 it just seems like everything we did john was someplace else in my mind he is not a conservative
3050145 i think its his style as much as much as the positions he takes i think its his attitude that its his way or the highway
3050146 has a legendary temper and often uses foul and obscene language
3050147 johns a person ive had a lot of disagreements with but youve got to have a lot of respect for him im not speaking as if im a born again supporter of john mccain im just trying to express it the way that i see him
3050148 what has struck me about mccain is that everybody underestimated the ability of his advisers and him to hypnotize the national media because most of us in the media in

3050151 at the present time we occupy a very important and critical position in the politics of this nation both in terms of the trade union movement as well as the political parties of this country we are in nobodys pocket do not intend to get in anybodys pocket and we are going to assume a position of full partners you see we dont want anybody to be making decisions for us any longer because we are quite capable of making decisions ourselves we dont want to be a thorn in anybodys side but we dont want to be a pivot for anybodys heel

3050208 mi sono appostato dietro un masso aveva detto vicino a cucinella giuseppe il quale nello spiegarmi nuovamente il funzionamento del moschetto si accorse che si era guastato e mi disse lascialo andare e spara con la pistola
3050209 a pianterreno vi una camera adibita a cantina ed a legnaia vi una finestra che d su terreno coltivato ad orto chiamato vallone
3050210 che i malfattori continuarono a sparare qualche raffica di mitra finch uscirono dal paese dileguandosi nella sottostante campagna e il loro numero era di otto
3050211 non si era mosso dalla contrada nella quale accudiva al lavoro
3050212 a meno che non sia legata ad un fatto di emottisi
3050213 il reversino una volta venne da me per dirmi che voleva essere ammesso nella banda di mio figlio io ne parlai a mio figlio il quale si rifiut
3050214 in un mese che non posso precisare egli ha detto ma pu darsi tra giugno e luglio di un anno che non indica cucinella antonino venne a salutarmi dicendo che si allontanava dalla sicilia dopo di allora non lho visto pi
3050215 si mostrava preoccupata perch da vari giorni non aveva notizie del marito
3050216 hai visto quel disgraziato se li portati a sparare a portella della ginestra e ci capit pure mio fratello peppino

3050220 che uomo sei che malandrino sei cos che vuoi vincere la battaglia
3050221 era uno dei pi vicini al giuliano anche se ve ne furo no altri
3050222 riconosco genovese giovanni che prese parte alla consumazione delleccidio di portella della ginestra l 46 e che terranova antonino e musso gioacchino hanno fatto cenno altres alla sua presenza nella formazioni di marcia ponendolo nel gruppo di testa
3050223 tra me ed i predetti si parl di essi come partecipanti allazione di portella per altro essi non potevano negare n a me n agli altri di aver partecipato allazione di portella tale affermazione negativa possono fare solo alla corte
3050224 pantuso e licari che sono carcerati a palermo oltre cucinella giuseppe e i genovese
3050225 giovannino manfr come si espresse al giudice istruttore e che uno solo di essi fosse nel gruppo parrebbe confermato da tinervia giuseppe il quale se asser nellinterrogatorio stragiudiziale
3050226 e 132 di portare dalla mandria pane formaggio e una brocca dacqua per rifocillare i convenuti mentre per un verso caratterizza lidentificazione del genovese per laltro accresce la credibilit del fatto
3050227 siatene testimoni che sin da stamattina sono qui insieme a mio fratello nel caso che ci vogliono caricare questa situazione
3050228 ritorni dal giudi ce il quale come amministratore di giustizia assetato di verit vera anche se qualche volta servendosi dei processi e non dei fatti commette degli errori
3050229 i nostri rapporti col giuliano ha precisato il terranova w 1 69 erano quelli che pu avere un dipendente rispetto a un capo obbedienza assoluta
3050230 terranova cacaova dichiar infatti il genovese nella udienza del 2 luglio 1951 insistette due volte presso di me perch dichiarassi chi erano gli autori della lettera
3050231 se non farete al ritorno del mio compare terranova quello che costui ha detto mi accoller io tutto e vi far correre dietro di me
3050232 non posso dire se sapienza giuseppe di francesco spar o non a portella dove certamente and mai in altra occasione vidi sapienza con giuliano
3050233 se dal posto in cui egli e gli altri tre cacciatori furono fatti sostare era possibile vedere tutta la zona sottostante
3050234 ma il mio ordine era solamente quello di intimorire i comunisti a portella di sparare in aria per sciogliere il comizio
3050235 anche prima della detenzione sapendo che il terranova era in continuo contatto con giuliano insistetti presso di lui perch gli riferisse che fra i detenuti vi erano degli innocenti come mio fratello ed altri
3050236 il pisciotta francesco anche quando eravamo liberi mi disse sempre di riferire quanto a me ed a lui risultava
3050237 siamo a cinque giorni di distanza dal 1 maggio sia perch la prima affermazione del pisciotta lunica cui potevasi prestare fede di aver visto il corrao a
3050238 avvenne il 1 maggio di mattina presto due o tre giorni dopo larrivo della jeep
3050239 il giorno precedente a quello del detto conflitto ci trovammo tutti a
3050240 siamo rimasti in localit pernice fino alla mattina del giorno in cui avvenne il conflitto con i carabinieri conflitto che ritenevo fosse avvenuto la mattina del due maggio
3050241 si sarebbe trovato in quella stessa contrada in cui si sarebbe
3050242 senza per che si incontrasse n con il fratello n con
3050243 restarono fino al giorno in cui appresero il conflitto avvenuto tra carabinieri da un lato ed i banditi taor mina angelo vito pagliuso e candela rosario dallaltro
3050244 ricordo che il 30 aprile 1947 il pisciotta si trov in contrada
3050245 rientrato a casa narr pisciotta vincenzo ai ca rabinieri l 134 raccontai ai miei genitori che avevo visto mio fratello francesco che stava bene che li salu tava
3050246 era un giovane egli disse intelligente e colto e fu il primo a dare lezioni al giuliano di grammatica e di bello scrivere
3050247 mio fratello salvatore ella disse non voleva che si facesse il matrimonio perch la famiglia dello sciortino non intendeva recarsi a casa mia a chiedere la mia mano dato che mio fratello salvatore era incorso nella sua
3050248 dai giorni successivi al matrimonio si noti la prudenziale indeterminatezza della proposizione al 13 14 maggio
3050249 dopo alcuni giorni dal matrimonio ella disse mio genero ebbe un attacco di appendicite per cui rest a letto circa otto giorni fu dopo la guarigione di mio genero che io mandai la lettera certamente dopo il 1 maggio l947 giorno nel quale egli era ammalato ed a letto v 5 642 e 644 e la stessa versione mantenne nella deposizione resa nel corso della inchiesta giudiziaria contro i pretesi man danti precisando che il genero port la lettera al cogna to circa sei giorni dopo il 1 maggio
3050250 nessuno contesta che sciortino abbia portato la lettera il 27 o il 28 aprile ma nessuno pari menti pu contestare allo sciortino di essersi ammalato subito dopo avere portato la lettera
3050251 ero ancora convalescente quando il 1 maggio 1947 si sparse per montelepre la notizia della sparato ria avvenuta a portella della ginestra
3050252 la mamma e la sorella dello sciortino che restarono a montelepre ad assistere il loro congiunto e vi si fermarono due o te giorni
3050253 in casa dello sciortino in terrasini dal 21 al 24 giugno
3050254 lidentificazione dellautore di un reato pu essere stabilita dal giudice con ogni mezzo le gittimo anche al di fuori di un formale atto di ricognizione
3050255 uno sconosciuto di 28 anni circa da s giuseppe o da s cipirrello
3050256 nulla so della riunione di testa di corsa e del discorso che vi avrebbe tenuto sciortino pasquale inteso pinuzzo
3050257 a tutti gli imputati ho rivolto delle esortazioni a dire la verit nel loro interesse perch
3050258 dove era giuliano non poteva esservi che un delitto da preparare o da compiere
3050259 it is always our goal to get back to the national championship game and be big ten champions and national champions we have not beat michigan five times in a row and being big ten champs outright three times in a row is a goal it is going to be an exciting season and we are looking forward to it

3050263 more than 1 000 preschool and k 12 students with autism are now using an ohio state sponsored scholarship program that provides an educational option for parents who are dissatisfied with the services their child is receiving in a traditional public school
3050264 can be a part of the total solution for oklahoma
3050265 one of things weve stressed here and one of the things that made us most successful last season is that soccer is a team sport
3050266 you have to get your team playing as a team not as individual players and when the players all buy into that concept youre successful
3050267 we return three of four defenders and three of four midfielders from the team that went to the college cup
3050268 that gives us reason to be hopeful that if we can plug the holes well have a good team
3050269 we have been very comfortable in goal the last few years with ray burse jr and casey latchem
3050270 this year its a wide open competition and we may not know who our goalkeeper is going to be until the bert and iris wolstein classic is here and we have to pick one for that first game and well see how he does
3050271 during spring byron established himself as a more confident goalkeeper
3050272 if the season were to start today he would be our starter but we hope the competition for the goalkeeper spot is good and may the best man win
3050273 we havent had a chance to see him play yet because he is still rehabbing from the injury but considering he started 12 games for virginia tech in 2006 he is the most experienced goalkeeper of the three
3050274 gabel will probably move centrally this year but its not a definite thing so were going to have to see how things work out
3050275 we will have at least eight defenders in the pool
3050276 the competition to replace defense centrally should be pretty strong
3050277 by the end of the 2007 season roger may have been our best player especially in the two games at the college cup
3050278 by the end of last season irizarry and gold were a well oiled machine
3050279 they knew their roles well and played off of each other very well and we hope they regain that form this season
3050280 geoff has been outstanding on the right side of the midfield forever
3050281 if necessary he can come inside and play and use his great athleticism to be a ball winner hes a very versatile and experienced right side of the midfield player which is a great plus for us
3050282 andrew has a lot more confidence now after playing really well in the big ten and ncaa tournaments
3050283 i think he is finally realizing that he needs to turn up the juices year round and play every game hard were going to rely a lot on andrew to score goals for us this season
3050284 konrad is a great playmaker who we will lean on this season in dead ball and free kick situations

3050295 loic you do not have to smile as i take the picture
3050296 leweb was a remarkable conference why because loic took a far more participatory stance this year not to mention he spent 125 000 euros on the wifi which still didnt work that great and had power plugs under every seat that i was at every part of the experience was top rate and positions leweb as the most important industry conference period one little secret loics wife did much of the heavy lifting behind the scenes cathy brooks planned the content and i couldnt see how to improve it
3050297 loic the conferences organiser obviously took all of the criticisms of last years conference on board and delivered a fantastic conference this time out the talks were great the venue was perfect the food was delicious and the networking opportunities were tremendous
3050298 loic and geraldine have turned leweb3 into a really great conference possibly the best web conference of the year
3050299 the leweb3 was one of the most professionally produced conference i have attended in several ways the video projection was the best i have seen and the audio was top notch with very engaging musical intros i also liked the scheduel with lots of time for networking in the coffe and lunch breaks the lunch offering was a totally staggering buffet of french gourmet cuisine at it best

3050303 in general the conference was just awesome especially considering the magnitude of the whole thing almost 2 000 participants signed present
3050304 but if you do go to a conference its nice to feel welcomed as if you are a vip guest and thats what le web excels at it was definitely a very cool event the coolest most elegant tech event around by far

3050317 writing in the ieee spectrum james oberg analyzes whether there was in fact a significant risk to humans from the satellite which the us military shot down on 21 february purportedly to head off the possibility of its splashing a half ton of toxic hydrazine fuel somewhere on earth previous experts had scoffed at the rationale put forth pointing out that there was trivial possibility that any significant amount of toxic fuel would make it to the ground intact obergs analysis titled the inside story and claims that indeed its possible and even likely that there could be a danger to the ground unfortunately the analysis is full of flaws and lack of rigor indeed lacking any sort of numerical reasoning it seems to be too much repeating official spin and could have used a hefty dose of skepticism and could also use a little bit of actual analysis using numbers rather than handwaving

3050323 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3050324 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3050325 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3050326 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3050327 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3050328 as ultrasound becomes an emerging technology in the aesthetic market applisonix technology platform and experience pave the road for the company to join the leading aesthetic companies in the world in the hair removal and aesthetic market
3050329 the technology holds huge market potential and the company showed impressive execution capabilities
3050330 we think ultrasound presents a huge opportunity in the aesthetic market in general and specifically in hair removal we chose applisonix over other candidates which are some of the leading light based aesthetic companies as applisonix has developed an innovative ultrasound platform that could potentially change the way hair removal is done applisonix takes a phased commercialization approach starting with a hair by hair solution for small body areas and later a complementary component for larger body areas such gradual approach common to disruptive technologies can provide immediate commercial success paving the way for increasing market share
3050331 we congratulate the recognition by some of the leading technology and market analysts for the unique technology platform we developed for the market penetration strategy and for the companys commercial potential
3050332 the selection by a large and distinguished research firm such as frost amp sullivan of applisonix technology as innovative will help us establish applisonix position as a leading player in the global aesthetic market

3050439 we recognized the need in the marketplace for high quality scalable server based 3d visualization solutions more than five years ago but back when we first started talking about realityserver people thought we were crazy to think that the processing power and bandwidth for such a solution would be available much less at a reasonable cost per user

3050645 its disappointing weve got to take this talent that we are going to have on the 53 man roster we have to cover
3050646 we have got to cover on both sides we should have one of the best coverage teams in the nfl
3050647 i cant just start talking bad to somebody if they make a mistake
3050648 i cant chase them down really what i have to do is step out of the huddle because theres a lot of chatter a lot of guys talking about what happened on the play before i have to step out to hear what stew says
3050649 i have to make sure everybody gets back to the huddle
3050650 if they dont theyre waiting for me to make the call when you had the signals the secondary can see their coverage part its hard for the secondary because they always are run off if its a deep pass you have to wait on them so we still communicate its one of the things we have to work out

3050657 it prolonged war would be disastrous because the government has been very successful at turning an unappealing investment destination into an attractive one and if that was undone it would be a serious setback
3050658 the frozen conflict in south ossetia has always been a worry for foreign investors in georgia and if that is ultimately removed as a result of this it could become more appealing

3050662 russia has a very clear strategy and would prefer europes gas to go via russia and not via independent countries
3050663 there is no definite attempt to disrupt supplies but it is not unhelpful to russia that there is unrest
3050664 the shine hasnt quite come off the azeri star just yet as it is unclear quite how severe or long lasting the interruption in supplies through this corridor will be
3050665 nor is it clear yet what risks now hang over this pipeline
3050666 for europe the lesson is clear nabucco and related projects cannot be left entirely to the private companies caspian resources need protection from governments
3050667 we put a really low probability on the pipelines being affected it would require a significant escalation of the conflict
3050668 i would not get too hysterical about it if the pipeline to ceyhan does not resume work within two weeks it will happen within three weeks the turks will raise security the russians are unlikely to intervene and all will be fine again

3050673 those marion county homeowners who protested last year got their relief but there is no association of landlords or renters and we got pushed into the corner tenants had no voice and theyll pay more rent the next time the lease is up for renewal theyll get walloped

3050694 after baton charge and tear smoke failed to deter the mob the security forces had to fire at the protesters in which one person was killed and the senior hurriyat leader sheikh abdul aziz was injured
3050695 police and paramilitary forces used batons and tear smoke to disperse the violent mob which kept on regrouping and attacking the police and crpf with stones
3050696 police had to use rubber bullets to disperse the mob injuring 20 people one of whom later died in the hospital
3050697 abraham lincoln had it right our task should not be to invoke religion and the name of god by claiming gods blessing and endorsement for all our national policies and practices saying in effect that god is on our side rather as lincoln put it we should worry earnestly whether we are on gods side
3050698 the will of god prevails in great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of god both may be and one must be wrong god cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time in the present civil war it is quite possible that gods purpose is somewhat different from the purpose of either party and yet the human instrumentalities working just as they do are of the best adaptation to effect this

3050703 the accounts were totally clear there was really nothing in the allegations i think this has been quite malicious
3050704 one of these was for the grant money and another was a savings account it made sense to keep the money separate
3050705 there is nothing going on i knew all along it was just a storm in a teacup our members just want to safeguard public money

3050733 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3050734 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3050735 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3050736 one must not hurry on such serious issues as serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
3050737 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3050738 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3050739 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play you dont want to play around with teams if you have a chance to make a statement and put them away early you do that

3050741 anyone on this team could do it any given night
3050742 i dont feel the defeat today brings too much pressure
3050743 watching the game from the stands last night really motivated us
3050744 seeing lebron james block a shot with two hands off the backboard and just the way they were playing defense got us ready everyone came into this game knowing the crowd could be a factor
3050745 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3050746 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3050747 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3050763 i am shocked we have lost not only an incredible talent but a wonderful leader to his community and a dear friend to me there will only be one isaac hayes gifting us with years of performing writing and a voice that penetrated deep into our souls he is to be admired for changing his life around and standing steadfast to his beliefs his integrity and to helping others isaac you will be missed but never forgotten

3050788 what do i think of alberto aquilanis sending off everyone has to take responsibility on these occasions he needed to focus better

3050790 the manager is speaking with the chairman all the time i think the squad is short and it is important that we get some new players in but the players we sign must strengthen us everton is a team already that has quality and we need to add to that moutinho is a good player and he is someone i know he was a star at euro 2008 for portugal
3050791 he is sharp plays good football and he drives the team forward he is also a leader if he wasnt there would be no way that he would captain a big club like sporting at the age of 21

3050807 parents do not have a constitutional right to homeschool their children
3050808 we conclude that california statutes permit homeschooling as a species of private school education
3050809 the california appeals court shocked the nation with its ruling in february
3050810 we decided as part of a broad survey of more than 1 200 adult americans to get their reaction and found that 61 percent strongly agreed that the constitution guarantees the right of parents to homeschool and another 25 percent agreed somewhat
3050811 americans appear to believe that parents not the government should decide whether or not they should homeschool
3050812 a primary purpose of the educational system is to train school children in good citizenship patriotism and loyalty to the state and the nation as a means of protecting the public welfare
3050813 as is the case with polling research we are not asking if something is true but rather what people believe
3050814 and it is important to note that americans do believe that schooling at home leads to issues with social skills and this is a perception that homeschooling families need to overcome

3050874 ive said publicly that i do not subscribe to the notion that the painfully slow response of fema and the department of homeland security was racially based the ineptitude was color blind i see no evidence of active malice but i see a continuation of passive indifference on the part of our government towards the least of these
3050875 you have to be true to yourself but i have to be true to myself as well
3050876 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks

3050881 you have to make a good film that would be a good film under any circumstances
3050882 you have to put the narrative first the reality is no matter how many 3 d screens we get you are still going to have a large number of people possibly the majority of people who see the film in a 2 d environment
3050883 the way we developed the performance capture workflow on avatar is we have our virtual camera which allows me to in real time hold a camera its really a monitor in my hands and point it at the actors and see them as their cg chartacters
3050884 that is going though facial algorithms and going back into the camera as a real time cg face of the character you see it talk you see the eyes move it is pretty phenomenal
3050885 once weve laid down a take the take exists in the digital asset management system it an be accessed at any time long after the actors have gone home im still out there with the virtual camera shooting coverage on the scene i just have to play the take back i can do the close up the wide shot i can even move them around on a limited basis we relight it we do all kinds of things
3050886 when you are doing performance capture creatively its very daunting its very hard to imagine what it will look like but if you can see it if you can have a virtual image of what is it going to be like then you are there im still doing a lot of virtual camera work on the film on stuff that was shot six months ago
3050887 we changed the words and actor laz alonzo redid the dialogue we didnt have to recapture his body performance and he didnt have to put the performance capture suit on again we were just creating new words and we were creating a new face
3050888 were taking our virtual production toolset and superimposing it on physical production we turned the set on the soundstage into a capture volume and turned the physical camera into a capture virtual camera so we were able to integrate cg characters and environments into our live action
3050889 we have people in flying vehicles and i can see what is outside the window fed in in real time
3050890 arms and armour from the movies the wonderful world of weta
3050891 youre included in a way that a lot of the bigger films arent going to include you

3050894 as the cost to produce and market theatrical films continues to rise nearly all the majors are supplementing their theatrical releases with high profile fare made for dvd building on a trend of the past several years
3050895 the direct to dvd movie is as old as the dvd business itself
3050896 but what has happened in the last three years is that you cant make any old movie and throw it together and expect the consumer to buy and rent it
3050897 your security is based on the state of our relationship
3050898 the conversation took place during bhuttos meeting with us lawmakers at capitol hill including john kerry and state department officials suskind says

3050902 i dont know how much you know about my grandfathers administration
3050903 but that administration stood for multilateral engagement balancing the budget
3050904 he has very little debt i just love it anybody who wants to make him out as this wide eyed liberal i just dont see any evidence for that not in the way he runs his campaign and this tells you a lot about how he can administer things how he manages things how he deals with situations
3050905 this race is very similar to the 1952 campaign that brought my grandfather to power
3050906 he was an outsider who was nominated by the republican party but it was not an easy process at all he was an outsider who threatened to shake up the party itself
3050907 its sci fi but its very much well i think people toss out philip dick sci fi when they mean small dark sci fi although when i think of philip dicks books its something very different i think people are confusing it with the movie blade runner
3050908 to me its a lot more like the first terminator its very sci fi but its very character based and very concentrated its very different from the terminator movies but its like the first terminator in that time travel is involved with it but only as a plot device
3050909 in addition we now have greater flexibility to complete the continuation of our value enhancement plan
3050910 our financial results from this quarter in aggregate are poor
3050911 however they are largely a reflection of many of the key components of the turnaround program
3050912 however housing activity is definitely on a downward trend consistent with indications of deteriorating affordability through last year this factor is expected to keep new residential construction activity under pressure going forward our forecast assumes that starts will drop on average 5 3 per cent this year and 14 8 per cent next year
3050913 during the second quarter in spite of the impact economic conditions are having on consumer spending our domestic business continued to demonstrate both stability and growth across all our product lines
3050914 after an encouraging start to the year our second quarter was the strongest in our history
3050915 performance has been driven on a broad base of strong organic revenue growth low loan loss provisions and the widening of our networks margins we continue to be on target for growth in revenue earnings and market share for 2008
3050916 i think the rain this last day and a half helped but the first two days when we got here i was struggling with the pollution the heat the humidity

3050930 the proposal encourages facilitates and harnesses entrepreneurial space achievement enabling a dynamic globally competitive commercial space sector is in line with national policy and is mutually beneficial to the air force and the state
3050931 we take great pride in fostering a vibrant commercial space sector and expect the spirit of innovation and attitude of cooperation that made this idea into a reality to be prevalent in the years to come
3050932 our primary mission here is to assure access to the high frontier
3050933 florida has a great legacy in aerospace a great foundation to build on and that is one more reason we are so committed to expanding our capability to launch from florida and from the united states
3050934 we have worked closely with the air force over the past several months and look forward to a strong long term relationship as we build these safe commercial launch processes together
3050935 the air force assignment of launch complex 36 is an important next step to extending access to space making it available to defense and security initiatives and multiple commercial payload and launch activities for both civil and private space businesses that wish to launch from florida
3050936 the florida legislature demonstrated tremendous foresight when it appropriated initial funding of 14 5 million for fy 2009 this funding will help space florida begin the launch complex infrastructure design and construction necessary to develop a true commercial multi use launch complex this direction by the air force together with the tremendous support by the state opens the door to attracting supporting and sustaining national and international aerospace business here in florida
3050937 one of space floridas next objectives is to establish a commercial launch zone clz for commercial customers wishing to operate from the eastern range the creation of a clz expands our ability to support commercial payload launch services re supply missions to the international space station and aggressively diversify aerospace business development rapidly and efficiently
3050938 the assignment of launch complex 36 will be an important milestone and part of a broader strategy to establish a clz at the cape
3050939 the commercial launch zone is intended to enable space industry located at the cape and in florida to be more competitive in the global economy
3050940 our detector actually flew to the edge of outer space and then back to ground and the whole time it workedperfectly
3050941 the purpose of the grant is not only to develop instrumentation for use in space flight but also to promote student interest in science and engineering through experiments with high altitude balloons
3050942 the best part about the project is that the detector was built from everyday materials and launched into near space from right here in our own backyard this proves you can accomplish really amazing things with simple materials
3050943 it was thought that looking back in the past earlier galaxies would not have generated much magnetic field
3050944 the results of this study show that the magnetic fields within milky way like galaxies have been every bit as strong over the last two thirds of the universes age as they are now and possibly even stronger then
3050945 there must be some other explanation for a much quicker and earlier amplification of galactic magnetic fields
3050946 from the time when the first stars and galaxies formed their magnetic fields have probably have been amplified by very fast dynamos one good possibility is that it happened in the explosive outflows that were driven by supernovae and possibly even black holes in the very earliest generations of galaxies

3050950 at the beginning of that year i gathered my team for an off site meeting to identify our top five risks for the coming 12 months we were paid to think about the downsides but it was hard to see where the problems would come from four years of falling credit spreads low interest rates virtually no defaults in our loan portfolio and historically low volatility levels it was the most benign risk environment we had seen in 20 years
3050951 no crisis comes completely out of the blue there are always clues and advance warnings if you can only interpret them correctly
3050952 of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane
3050953 that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
3050954 create a single standard of high quality comprehensive and preventive health care for all
3050955 allow freedom of choice of physician hospital and other health care providers
3050956 eliminate financial barriers that prevent families and individuals from obtaining the medically necessary care they need
3050957 allow physicians nurses and other licenced health care providers to make health care decisions based on what is best for the health of the patient
3050958 there are different approaches within the democratic party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage
3050959 we were happy to discover the level of support among committee members for guaranteed health care and are pleased that a compromise was reached but we wont be satisfied until hr 676 is passed by congress
3050960 i wanted something to save gas money something to get good gas mileage with
3050961 im probably saving about 40 dollars a week in gasoline
3050962 if we had more scooters in smaller places more parking for everyone and it encourages people to ride scooters and motorcycles
3050963 we take the scooter out when its nice because of the mileage
3050964 its very good if you ride 55 mph or less you do very well i just dont use that much to have to check it its not like a car
3050965 to be honest i have never really been a huge mlb fan
3050966 i know that sounds crazy but growing up my dad was a high school basketball coach and i played basketball football and baseball my favorite baseball team right now though would have to be the arizona diamondbacks because my best friend chad tracy plays there and he played with me in college
3050967 but i was more of a college basketball fan growing up thats where all of my spare time went to was watching college hoops i loved north carolina and i always wanted to see them play duke in cameron indoor stadium ive been to a game there but not against north carolina so that has been kind of like a lifelong dream of mine
3050968 watch north carolina play duke in cameron win a national championship in baseball and meet any president of the united states because id be interested in hearing their views and how they became the president id love to have a conversation with him
3050969 if i have a couple of days off i go to the beach i always went to wrightsville beach in north carolina because a lot of my friends were there and there is white sand and clear water
3050970 i was a pitcher and a catcher when i started playing ball
3050971 in high school i really liked to pitch but i didnt have the velocity i just wanted to play a position where i was in the game with every pitch in college my coaches obviously wanted me to catch but i think my high school coach i cant speak for him would have wanted me on the mound in the end im glad i was a catcher i enjoyed my career at ecu and theres no better feeling than hitting the ball and knowing that its going out thats one of the best thrills you can have in any sport
3050972 i didnt take it very seriously i guess everything the president does is interesting

3050977 on the agricultural project we are collaborating with some international agencies to lay strong emphasis on modern and sustainable ways of producing crops like groundnuts cassava cotton ginger rice among other cash crops
3050978 the programme is also meant to support governments genuine efforts at alleviating poverty at the grassroots level through the agricultural sector and provision of affordable housing for the real poor
3050979 it is targeted at millions of the truly poor people we have no doubt that these projects will proffer the desired initiative of non state actors employing various platforms as a veritable tool for poverty eradication and human capital development in the state and country
3050980 people form a general impression of somebody thats as important as his stand on the issues
3050981 we hope we convince the public to believe mccain is the safe choice a good leader even if you disagree with him on policy
3050982 this is becoming a contest of inexperience versus mccains decades of service in the military and senate
3050983 im so used to wearing a performers hat that it was gratifying to trust myself enough to write all of the music on this album
3050984 i feel like i really gave myself the chance to explore my own voice and be at my most creative this album really defines my style rootsy but edgy enough to be genre defying and commercially accessible
3050985 anyas ability to show emotions to make you feel what shes feeling is something you dont always find in a young singer

3050996 i was sick and tired of coming home and feeling sick and tired
3050997 i knew i had to do something about it but i didnt know how to support my family financially while spending more time on my music and less time at work
3050998 i decided that i was going to start off small and work my way towards my goal of being my own boss
3050999 i joined the heavy metal band because there was nothing else in my neighborhood at the time if i had the option then i would have chosen hip hop if you listen to my hip hop beats you will notice they have a rock and roll edge to them i think that makes them unique
3051000 it took me weeks to figure out how to upload tracks on the various sites i was lost
3051001 i am very grateful to have a supportive family because i worked for most of the day which was very unfair to my wife i guess she understood that i was trying to do something that would benefit our family in the long run shes awesome
3051002 i started to make money and that made me want to work harder
3051003 i did not know anything about computers or internet marketing but i was selling something on the internet
3051004 i received an email from carlos and he expressed that he liked my beats and he wanted to propose a business venture to me the business venture included my own website a large marketing budget company branding and his know how i was skeptical at first but i decided to take a chance the rest is history
3051005 mark was very talented but i knew that i could help him with his marketing the first thing i noticed was the fact that he did not have his own website the beat marketplaces are a good way to make a couple sales here and there but there lots of noise on those pages that take the potential customers attention away from his product the first thing we did was build mark a site and promote his company brand bos beats
3051006 in order to make loyal customers we have given our customers many advantages when they think of purchasing a beat they come to us because we give them more for their money in this day and age of high gas prices and inflation thats all everyone is looking for more for their money thats what the site is built around
3051007 what can i say other than you cant beat bos beats the material is radio quality beats at affordable prices i feel like i have timberland type beats for a fraction of the cost i buy one beat and i get three mark has also given me feedback that has helped improve my skills as a rapper my sister sings and she also buys her beats from bos beats hes the truth man
3051008 im so happy things happened the way they did everything happens for a reason now i can spend time doing what i like make enough money doing it and help the artists improve
3051009 even those who dont consider themselves comic fans are sure enjoy the pics of these gorgeous girls in capes cowls and sexy superhero costumes whoever says that comic con fans dont know their fashion apparently hasnt seen the marvel disguise fashion show

3051014 ive been watching for seven straight hours and there hasnt been a damn thing on
3051015 final fantasy iv is one of the most significant titles in the history of the franchise it has been remarkably enhanced for the nintendo ds making it a great opportunity for our fans to experience its deep story and ground breaking battle system in an exciting and innovative new way
3051016 the experience started me on a pathway on how to work with energy
3051017 reiki heals by flowing through the effected parts of the energy field and charging them with positive energy
3051018 it raises the vibratory level of the energy field in and around the physical body where the negative thoughts and feelings are attached this causes the negative energy to break apart and fall away in so doing reiki clears straightens and heals the energy pathways thus allowing the life force to flow in a healthy and natural way
3051019 as reiki flows through a sick or unhealthy area it breaks up and washes away any negative thoughts or feelings lodged in the unconscious mind body thus allowing a normal healthy flow of ki to resume as this happens the unhealthy physical organs and tissues become properly nourished with ki and begin functioning in a balanced healthy way thus replacing illness with health
3051020 the most reported thing that i receive is that theyre totally relaxed and have a feeling of peace
3051021 while reiki is spiritual in nature it is not a religion it has no dogma and there is nothing you must believe in order to learn and use reiki

3051028 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

3051030 tierra que la forestales las adquirieron bajo leyes de la dictadura de pinochet a costa de negarle el derechos hist rico sobre la tierra a las comunidades mapuche
3051031 valorar lo alcanzado producto una lucha que muchos han pagados con c rceles y condena inesperada pero que nada es en vano por que la unidad de todas la luchas sociales en alg n momento de nuestra historia derrotara al sistema opresor neoliberal y pasada las elecciones municipales de octubre viviremos un chile distinto y nosotros la izquierda lo mapuche seguiremos avanzando en un proyecto de sociedad que contemple definitivamente nuestro territorio y autonom a
3051032 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3051033 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado

3051035 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3051036 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

3051039 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3051040 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3051041 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3051042 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3051043 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3051044 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3051086 the size and discount of that type of deal isnt the norm yet
3051087 the critical mass of bulk reo is in well capitalized institutions that dont need to sell yet in bulk at a deep discount because they are better off not taking substantial hits to the capital just to get the assets off their books
3051088 this type of bulk buy would make an impact on the market they are in a unique position because they have a long time horizon to invest and a cheap cost of capital its actually a perfect time for them to acquire these reo assets

3051090 auchi polytechnic today is at a cross road because the legal status of the school is in doubt as the take over of the polytechnic was orally announced by general ibrahim babangida in 1993 and not gazetted to give the pronoucement a backing
3051091 he was a sales manager for our company and it occurred to him that there were awards for hitting but none for defense

3051101 there was nobody who was suitably qualified to do it so thats kind of on hiatus
3051102 we could have gone ahead with someone lousy which would have been a really bad idea we decided to wait until someone who is properly qualified and has the necessary skills shows up
3051103 theres nothing concrete with that but we do hope to talk to the fire department about it
3051104 we just had a 100 year old house on vermilion street burn and houses burning down are not good for preserving history
3051105 the need for comprehensive preventive and primary health services that address the physical emotional and educational needs of students is supported by current data
3051106 a school based health center may enable students to have a better quality of life improve their academic performance and have lasting benefits for a healthy successful future
3051107 i just dont understand why the police took my sons life
3051108 he was shy he wasnt the type of guy who would antagonize a police officer
3051109 he didnt like clubbing or drinking beer he was a quiet guy he liked to stay in
3051110 why why did the police officer need to kill him
3051111 i cant tell you what they were doing we dont even know how many teenagers there were
3051112 he was standing up and then the police pushed him to the ground because he was too aggressive he was trying to fight them
3051113 we were six guys and two girls we approached but we didnt touch them
3051114 the police officer took out her gun without thinking it just happened too fast
3051115 at one point the group began to move and a good number of individuals charged toward the police and threatened them
3051116 one of the police officers present then fired in the direction of the suspects striking three of them
3051117 a friend of fredys called his aunt and then she called here thats how we found out
3051118 these were peaceful guys who always hung out around here
3051119 they were all friends from childhood they were just protecting themselves
3051120 i know there are gangs here and there are drugs going on but they were only playing marbles so its really not fair what they did he didnt sell drugs he didnt smoke he didnt drink he was really smart its heartbreaking
3051121 were going to sue this cant continue to happen fredy died for no reason
3051122 we want to know whether this is standard police technique

3051131 students are urged to have a career or academic endorsement
3051132 its really about doing some serious thinking and soul searching
3051133 theyve got to be constantly reflecting on whats best for them
3051134 one consequence may be ineligibility to enter a state university
3051135 theres the ability to expand the ability to be successful in both venues
3051136 well be trying to give them support and recommendations but students need to think whats best for me theyre not trapped into a schedule
3051137 that type of instruction was thought to be only applicable to gifted and talented students
3051138 we as teachers have to be competent and prepared and able to facilitate conversation were guiding the learning the kids are begging for this they want to see the relevance of what they are learning
3051139 the more we expect from students the more they seem to produce were hoping as the bar is raised particularly in math which we see as a gateway course to college students will meet that challenge the chance of success in a college classroom increases and the chances of campuses retaining students are increased

3051153 law enforcement operations like this should reassure the public that ice is committed to putting public safety first every individual targeted as part of this operation has a criminal record
3051154 criminal aliens should be on notice that ice is working closely with local law enforcement to take off the streets those who threaten the very safety of our neighborhoods

3051189 the instinct of story telling came to me very early
3051190 when i was ten years old the teacher began to teach us composition in the chinese school i wrote my first one and he liked it and asked me to copy it down on proper paper then he sent it to a chinese newspaper i think it was s in jiew jit poh which at that time had a childrens section and it was published he gave me so much encouragement and he began to ask me to write compositions with different titles from other students so i wrote more i loved it and i learned more quickly than other students and the habit of writing started from there
3051191 the prose style would be very different the essence would be lost and it would be like writing a new book
3051192 when i finished secondary school the first two books by international writers i read were milan kunderas t 100 years of solitude both of which opened her eyes to the possibilities of literature
3051193 a mature interesting writer who was far ahead of most of us
3051194 thats why i like to take up challenges i like to experiment with form and medium im not satisfied if something is easy

3051196 we are not going to cut salaries staff or any other assets that are important to the company sometimes we compensate by raising prices but mostly were just eating the additional costs
3051197 in this economy we are in no position to ask the customer to pay more
3051198 though my company continues to grow chinas shift has made me closely monitor other expenses such as how many hours my team works and how much our office supplies cost

3051200 pollution was a major source of discontent among the population but u s retailers were pushing for low costs local officials were bribed to turn a blind eye
3051201 but now beijing has its eye on local authorities manufacturers are being more careful about obeying rules that were previously ignored
3051202 its the responsibility of the importer to ensure that the product is safe and hence the manufacturing facility has to be up to u s standards
3051203 weve had to implement improved processes for dying the fabric and disposing of the water that is emitted from the machines we also have to carefully control the lead content in the dye solutions
3051204 we get certificates of compliance which make the retailer and consumer feel comfortable about the product
3051205 we were running two 12 hour shifts every day but the new labor law restricted how long the temp workers could be on the job
3051206 it was difficult to find enough workers to cover six four hour shifts as an alternative i replaced 20 workers who cut excess metal off the components after casting with an 85 000 machine which has increased my capital expenditure
3051207 theres a feeling that this law might be too much too soon

3051214 what i find amazing is how uniquely bad us domestic air travel is compared to both international travel and domestic travel in china and india international travel even economy is much higher margin so it makes sense for it to offer better service in india and china it is a very new thing for middle class folks and low level business travellers to be able to afford air travel as a result carriers are competing both on price and on service even the 45 minute flight from bangalore to chennai on a budget airline one way price about 40 includes a hot meal posted by missionpk august 11 2008 12 11 am

3051221 the samsung instinct is an elegant full featured touch cellphone that is arguably the best consumer device bell mobility has ever launched in canada
3051222 but its not in the same league as apple inc s iphone
3051223 while the samsung instinct 130 on a three year contract looks undeniably like the iphone the similarities are only on the surface
3051224 one feature the instinct lacks that the iphone has is wi fi connectivity this gives the iphone a distinct edge when it comes to mobile browsing speed when wi fi is available as well as savings on data usage as wi fi data doesnt count against monthly limits
3051225 a me too phone and is burdened by a slow and clunky user interface surfing the web on its browser was pouring molasses on a cold day slow at times despite being on bell aliants advanced evdo high speed mobile data network in moncton using the browser was frustrating at times as well because the softwares zoom in and zoom out button for web pages lacks the sophistication and the ease of apples pinch and spread finger motions
3051226 the instinct isnt an iphone killer because it lacks apples winning combination of elegant hardware sleek easy to use software and tight integration with the itunes music and applications store

3051247 at the beginning of that year i gathered my team for an off site meeting to identify our top five risks for the coming 12 months we were paid to think about the downsides but it was hard to see where the problems would come from four years of falling credit spreads low interest rates virtually no defaults in our loan portfolio and historically low volatility levels it was the most benign risk environment we had seen in 20 years
3051248 no crisis comes completely out of the blue there are always clues and advance warnings if you can only interpret them correctly
3051249 our q2 sales came in below our initial projections primarily due to a weaker than expected demand in the u s for our core products we also experienced some softness in europe namely the u k which also impacted our top line performance while we have recently made progress in reducing costs at manufacturing and distribution platforms it was not enough to offset the lower than expected sales volumes for the quarter
3051250 the first six months of this year have been difficult as we dealt with a challenging retail enviroment unfavorable weather increased competition and a slowdown of sales for core styles in the u s that said there were also a number of positives in the quarter our international business continues to perform well we now sell in more than 100 countries with sales from outside the u s accounting for 58 of total sales in q2 sales in asia grew 69 australia and se asia pre books for q3 are particularly strong our business is also gaining momentum in south america
3051251 over the next two quarters we will be focused on right sizing our operations to better align with projected volume this will include reductions in worldwide headcount shutdown of canadian facility right sizing our distribution and infrastructure facilities and delaying certain capital expenditures we are also enacting a 25 cut in executive management salaries until the end of the year and foregoing executive bonuses for 2008
3051252 we will be implementing new initiatives aimed at broadening consumer awareness of our new products and strategically increasing our presence in the marketplace our plan is to focus on key accounts that have the resources and real estate to merchandise a larger assortment of crocs footwear beyond just a handful of styles therefore we do expect that our u s store count will come down by year end we expect to end the year with fourteen additional outlet stores and three additional fill price retail stores we plan to open additional stores in asia to take advantage of the momentum there

3051301 we have worked closely with our navy customer to understand their needs and provide them with the solutions they need to keep the e 6b a viable platform well into the future

3051319 the handling of the car got worse and worse and subsequently we found out that this was due to a tyre wear issue as well

3051323 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3051324 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3051325 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3051329 i appreciate everyones thoughts and prayers our family is lucky our son is going to live its going to be a long recovery but hes going to be okay we need to remember those who arent going to be okay we need to bring them home in the safest and most expedient way possible
3051330 but this just reiterates how we have to be there for our veterans i have worked for many years to make sure of veterans health care
3051331 we are currently working very hard to make the old silver cross hospital in joliet to be a veterans hospital it is imperative and weve been working on these veterans issues for years weve got to make sure we are there for our veterans when they come home we need to be there forever we have to make sure they have the best health care the best opportunities they are giving up a lot of their tomorrows for our todays
3051332 anybody who is a pubic servant like all of us know its not the credit that were looking for its the action
3051333 we dont need words we need action and thats why youre very fortunate to have state legislators like you do like careen and frank this is a team effort
3051334 everywhere we go we hear that people are worried about the values of their homes people are worried about their jobs theyre worried about whether they can put food on the table and then on top of it all how are we going to send our young people to college
3051335 those are not things we should be worried about i know and you know that america can do better and thats what we need to do from top to bottom and like i said bottom to top
3051336 we need a congressperson who knows what its like we talk about out ends not meeting there were times when i was a single mom trying to put food on the table that my ends did not even know each other
3051337 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3051338 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3051339 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3051340 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3051341 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3051342 its tough to fight an enemy that has a fort in our head

3051350 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress the bill obama killed was virtually identical to the federal bill that even naral ultimately did not oppose

3051356 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
3051357 comparing observations with results from computer models improves understanding of how rainfall responds to a warming world
3051358 differences can relate to deficiencies in the measurements or the models used to predict future climatic change
3051359 the classic example of a fingerprint is an ink imprint showing the unique swirls and loops used for identification but fingerprints also leave behind a unique distribution of molecular compounds
3051360 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
3051361 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
3051362 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint the image could then be used with fingerprint recognition software to identify an individual

3051371 liz green sounds like a shy nina simone with an extraordinary voice held right back so that sometimes its not much more than a whisper making her gig an intimate and affecting performance

3051386 home schooling is simply educating children at home the most important points of home education are the freedom to create the best possible curriculum and its unique atmosphere advantageous to students parents and students have control over the curriculum so if they dont like some of the books by one company they can substitute by using books from another company for example when i was home schooled my parents used the a beka curriculum because my parents knew exactly what my strengths and weaknesses were they were able to design an education plan that would help me get the most out of my schooling

3051401 well first of all if you are a religious person you understand that once religion takes hold in a society it cant be stopped and secondly i think the olympics are going to serve as a chance for people to come and see china the way it is and let the chinese see the world and interface and have you know the opportunity to converse with people from around the world this is a very positive development in my view for peace who knows how chinas going to progress they have been through some very difficult political times the cultural revolution for one where the leadership actually created violent anarchy as the society turned on itself all i can tell you is its important for the united states to be active in this part of the world with all countries and to stay engaged with china

3051663 we believe that they are the residents of the house and had been long term residents of the far south coast
3051664 they live a nice quiet life they go to the club maybe once a week and you see them walking quite often
3051665 they are just a nice quiet couple he worked at the petrol station and did odd jobs for pocket money she liked doing her gardening she wouldnt harm a fly
3051666 they moved up from a few houses down the street a few weeks ago
3051667 there are a lot of break ins down here because there are a lot of places vacant houses owned by people in canberra
3051668 the police are kept pretty busy down here in that respect we are all just shaking our heads trying to work out why
3051669 egyptian security sources confirmed that egypt had pumped gas into tunnels in recent months before sealing them off they said the gas was not harmful and was used to prevent palestinians from trying to re enter the tunnels
3051670 the president and i confirmed our commitment to the principle and objective of a free trade agreement between our two countries

3051674 aussie beef will always succeed because aussie beef is always better
3051675 what we are looking for in the years ahead is a discussion on that proposal nothing more ambitious than that
3051676 im formally of the view that you either have a discussion which is focused about the future shape of our region or you just let it happen i would much rather be in the business of setting a goal setting a broad concept as the objective this will be a long debate
3051677 obviously mistakes have been made in the campaign i acknowledge that and i take those mistakes on my shoulders
3051678 but i still say the reason to call the early election was a valid reason
3051679 if you speak in response to what you understand to be the needs of the community speak in terms that they can understand and provide them with a plan they will support you

3051687 i think the police are talking to the cmc about whether we should reveal the results of our findings before every single court action is finished
3051688 it is plain silly to suggest that these reports should be withheld pending those two proceedings as no juries are involved in either
3051689 it is just another bout of filibuster on the part of the police interests which unfortunately in this case includes the minister
3051690 this is not about simplistic league tables this is about rich performance information about our schools
3051691 we can learn from kleins methodology of comparing like schools with like schools and then measuring the differences in school results in order to spread best practice
3051692 something joel klein is personally and passionately committed to is the identification of school need the comparison of like schools and the identification of best practice
3051693 the answer is not league tables and its not a to f reporting but its making sure we have this rich performance information available school by school
3051694 raising overall student performance and addressing underachievement requires investment teachers know it and parents know it
3051695 were better off identifying the kind of extra value that education offers so that we measure the progress people are making
3051696 this isnt about shaming people or telling people that theyve done badly
3051697 this is about understanding whats going on so that we can help schools that need extra assistance and its only by helping those schools that need extra assistance that were really going to have an education revolution for all australian kids in all australian schools
3051698 failure is recognised and addressed we must refuse to accept that low socio economic status makes it ok for poorer children to fail school

3051711 it will be very nice to compete against michael schumacher again like in 2004 we live very close to each other but rarely have a chance to meet

3051713 its fantastic to have s bastien return to the race of champions after missing last years event this announcement means that with him and michael schumacher we now have the two most successful drivers in the history of both formula 1 and world rallying set to compete at wembley
3051714 s bastiens record in the world rally championship is simply incredible and his two victories in the race of champions show that he is one of the greatest drivers in motorsport

3051739 total life story is a plus and certainly having a strong marriage for 29 years is a key part of that life
3051740 i have observed them up close as a married couple and family for more than 20 years what you see in public is the private reality that is a strong marriage a partnership love and affection and it appears to me that theyre even closer today than they were when i first met them years ago
3051741 id been through a national campaign a national spotlight and theres a seasoning and a toughness that comes from doing that and elizabeths health the two of us went through that our family went through that together and i think my feeling is that im going to tell people im going to speak the truth whatever the consequences are the most important thing for me is to be direct and honest with people and for them to just see me

3051748 i strongly condemn the in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3051749 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3051750 the whispered allegations about john edwards were an open secret that was debated in every newsroom and reported by almost none
3051751 i do know that if it were mitt romney instead of john edwards this would be on the front page of the new york times
3051752 there was a certain reluctance by members of the mainstream media to admit they were beaten on a very big story by the enquirer so they didnt chase it
3051753 waiting for the enquirer to fully report a story that they wouldnt otherwise report because its in the enquirer
3051754 gotten enough emails from anguished and angry members of the msm to conclude that its the prime reason for the msm blackout
3051755 if a politician whose chief appeal is his self advertised loyalty to his brave ill wife cheats on his brave ill wife whats he good for again
3051756 based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll
3051757 before edwardss admission the times never made a serious effort to investigate the story even as the enquirer wrote one sensational report after another
3051758 i do not think liberal bias had anything to do with it but i think the times like the washington post usa today the wall street journal the los angeles times major networks and wire services was far too squeamish about tackling the story the times did not want to regurgitate the enquirers reporting without verifying it which is responsible but the times did not try to verify it beyond a few perfunctory efforts which i think was wrong
3051759 auto psychoanalysis by the perp thats really rich when bill clinton acknowledged an affair after equally adamant denials he simply went into an old fashioned spiral of penitence his allegedly long dark night of his alleged soul
3051760 even in confessing to preening edwards was preening his diagnosis of narcissism was weirdly narcissistic or was it self narcissistic given his diagnosis im sure his h m o would pay
3051761 the creepiest part of his creepy confession was when he stressed to woodruff that he cheated on elizabeth in 2006 when her cancer was in remission his infidelity was oncologically correct

3051764 most msm in general had stayed away picking at it with their noses held as if looking for something valuable in a moldy dumpster
3051765 its the same old problem when the most scandalous of the tabs breaks an actual story
3051766 as always the most interesting thing ok to me about this are the cultural currents and implications is it worse when a darling of progressives betrays you than if its newt gingrich better the same was there a conspiracy to out edwards hatched in a political brain will the msm ever figure out the journalistic etiquette following a big tabloid scoop does anyone really think that a story splashed in the tabs and debated on blogs like a powerful fire back draft is somehow not part of the public discourse
3051767 i am incredibly annoyed that we have to waste any air print or pixel time on this why do i care about some dudes marriage and marital problems unless he did something that in any way abuses public power
3051768 i just dont care what politicians do with their zippers so long as their policies and votes are in order by nature national politicians are people who want power and want to be admired even adored to an absurd degree
3051769 was all this going on when you renewed your wedding vows last summer at that intimate backyard ceremony where you wrote your own vows and there was not a dry eye in the house the one your wife of 30 years lost weight for because she wanted to look pretty for you and fit into her wedding dress
3051770 i admired both of the edwards prior to this like most people i especially liked and admired elizabeth edwards even when i believed that edwards was hiding something i assumed elizabeth was a victim now thats changed
3051771 just taking the edwards current statements at their words i am left with a very uncomfortable truth both john and elizabeth edwards cynically used their marriage as a means to help john edwards win an election
3051772 im sure ill get some angry comments here but if youre an edwards supporter let me put this bluntly if you gave john and elizabeth edwards time money support or goodwill they played you
3051773 he isnt doing this to show hes inevitable and invincible
3051774 and he needs to give them this impression because hes a young black man from nowhere whos been well known for less than a year and he knows one of his biggest problems with older white voters is they just cant imagine a young black man from nowhere as president hes helping them imagine
3051775 however mr obama consistently shows that he doesnt know what he doesnt know its a theme with his talented confident staff they dont know what they dont know either because theyre young and theyve never been in power and it takes time to know what you dont know the presidential type seal with obama on it the sometimes over the top rhetoric about healing the earth and parting the seas they pick the biggest showiest venue for the berlin speech the brandenburg gate just like a president not realizing people would think ya gotta earn that one kid going to europe was fine but they should have gone in modestly with a modest venue quietly spread word that his speech was open to the public and then left the watching world awed by the hordes that showed up
3051776 mccain has spent two decades cultivating the press specifically the cadre of several dozen reporters based in washington who report for the leading national newspapers and television networks
3051777 not only is mccain an extremely wealthy man who didnt have to work for any of his wealth hes also a man of very expensive tastes
3051778 of course patricians can make presidents franklin roosevelt is the prime example but as mccain continues his campaign to define obama as a high living fancypants lets not forget the mccain was born into a life of privilege and continues to live that life today
3051779 mccain question of the day do you own your own private jet mccain does
3051780 as hybrid sales skyrocket theres a growing concern that the battery gas powered vehicles pose a risk because they arent as noisy as gas only engines a hybrid emits less than three decibels of noise when starting up a level hard to pick up with the human ear a hybrid clipping along at 35 miles per hour emits 75 decibels three years ago the national federation of the blind raised concerns that electric cars and hybrids pose special dangers to people who rely on their hearing to cross a street the group asked the national highway traffic safety administration to research the effect of quiet cars on pedestrians the group suggested some sort of noise be added to hybrids perhaps by having the radiator fan switch on whenever the car is operating by battery to alert people walking nearby
3051781 prior to being picked up by the broncos he was arrested for inciting a bar fight and causing five hundred grand in property damage on a side note he likes long walks on the beach and hes a budding interior decorator

3051792 sometimes she does look like a man in shirt and trousers
3051793 the two captains walk to the center of a packed stadium with an umpire in tow the umpire tosses a coin one captain calls and lo the toss as well as the match is won in a single flip and roll game over the crowd cheers the captains shake hands and everyone goes home good night
3051794 there is a little bit of the whore in all of us gentlemen whats your price
3051795 tell me if a player can hope for the man of the match award of say rs 2 5 lakhs 6 000 by playing well and is offered rupees 25 lakhs 60 000 by a bookie for playing badly in the same match what do you think hed do
3051796 nothing shows the commercialization of players and the game more than the picture last sunday of sourav ganguly pasting a sponsors sticker on his bat in the team hotel even as a spectator one feels diminished by the way some cricketers demean themselves in advertisements particularly when the advertisement involves a player diving full length to grab a soft drink as if his life depended on it
3051797 my folks always told me to be careful because money is the root of all evil the root of this issue is the sums of money involved it is far more attractive financially to play in the ipl
3051798 there are going to be a lot of players saying look if we are playing in the official twenty20 league we really dont want to join the new zealand team in the warm up matches before the test series with england in may because if we stay an extra three weeks in india we can earn far more money than by playing in the warm up matches for new zealand
3051799 the ipl was only four overs a game per bowler and it was like a paid holiday you only had to work hard if you felt like it which is probably why we finished second last
3051800 suddenly in the last 10 12 years i noticed that there was a lot of interest in the community from abroad not only from first and second generation anglo indians abroad but also researchers suddenly the community which was perceived to be dying was alive again and i found myself in the center of it every day i am inundated with queries about someones roots some people just want to know about the history and culture
3051801 some of the anglo indians abroad keep the newsletter as a status symbol as a coffee table book for showing off to visitors as something exotic that they receive from kolkata others have a genuine interest in keeping in touch with their roots in kolkata keeping in touch with what is happening to their old acquaintances and so on it is also the easiest way to let friends and relatives know important developments in their lives it also is a source of information to young anglo indians who are searching for their roots it is often through the newsletter that they come to know of me and seek my help in their quest
3051802 i told mcgowan that to be anglo indian does not mean that you were from an english family who happened to be living in india to be anglo indian means that a parent was indian not an immediate parent but someone the lineage comes down from the mothers side
3051803 i told him that although i did not know in the beginning that he was an ai after ten minutes in his company i would have known from his demeanor manners diction vocabulary and his accent
3051804 my mother is so reluctant to talk about her roots in kolkata that we never talk about it at home i really want to know about my anglo indian roots and to understand my history and culture
3051805 i had gone to a reception where i heard two old gentlemen talking about their pre independence experiences of india it was so interesting and so many people gathered around him to listen to his account it just set me thinking that all these will be lost once these people are no more and i thought of documenting these experiences i thought that here was something live something people would appreciate in years to come
3051806 i put a human face on their quest for me this is a passion and not just a job that i do i genuinely want all anglo indians all over the world to live as a community connected through my newsletter the global presence of my newsletter has been possible because people understood what i was trying to do it is for the same reason they come to me because they know that i have experienced the community they come to me because i make them feel like they belong
3051807 an anglo indian means a person whose father or any of whose other male progenitors in the male line is or was of european descent but who is domiciled within the territory of india and is or was born within such territory of parents habitually resident therein and not established there for temporary purposes only

3051832 he said he followed the car and saw it go across a field and actually enter a canal in the area of the idaho center
3051833 several other officers arrived there and two of our officers removed their gun belts and emergency gear and dived into the canal and they were actually able bring the victim out of the water just as the car fully submerged

3051924 parents do not have a constitutional right to homeschool their children
3051925 we conclude that california statutes permit homeschooling as a species of private school education
3051926 the california appeals court shocked the nation with its ruling in february
3051927 we decided as part of a broad survey of more than 1 200 adult americans to get their reaction and found that 61 percent strongly agreed that the constitution guarantees the right of parents to homeschool and another 25 percent agreed somewhat
3051928 americans appear to believe that parents not the government should decide whether or not they should homeschool
3051929 a primary purpose of the educational system is to train school children in good citizenship patriotism and loyalty to the state and the nation as a means of protecting the public welfare
3051930 as is the case with polling research we are not asking if something is true but rather what people believe
3051931 and it is important to note that americans do believe that schooling at home leads to issues with social skills and this is a perception that homeschooling families need to overcome

3051937 yes because of the artillery the captain told me to go because of the artillery
3051938 only the animals i stated the cat of course will be all right a cat can look out for itself but i cannot think what will become of the others

3051969 we havent come to grasp that our population is changing
3051970 taught me how these things were working in human systems
3051971 it was very important for me to understand the business world
3051972 i never believed in just publishing papers even as a young man i wanted to create something which would go on a pharmacy shelf
3051973 very few people have this rare blend of science talent and business knowledge
3051974 but amar may say well you may want to talk to the statisticians the trial design may have particular aspects we need to explore before we go into the physician community
3051975 but this is not reflected in the physician desk reference because the clinical trials were not done with enough representatives of that population
3051976 maybe for some drugs it doesnt matter but maybe for others it does
3051977 if youre trying to do good science what you would like to have is a population of patients that is truly representative of the epidemiology of the disease youre studying
3051978 sure you can hit all the boxes and you might even get your drug approved but as soon as it hits the market it gets exposed not just to the patient on which you did the trial
3051979 i remember thinking that all through the years i did my graduate work and my postdoctoral work i logged 70 hours a week and i loved what i was doing
3051980 but i was never quite consumed by it the way that for instance my brother the marine biologist was completely consumed by his work he had fish tanks at home fish tanks all over his office he even conned me into keeping a fish tank of piranhas because he didnt have any place else to put them now thats a person whos really consumed by his work i was passionate but not consumed
3051981 one day i was standing knee deep in water videotaping a bunch of dogs that were performing water rescue trials and wondering whether the trait was or was not genetic when i realized id finally found something that consumed me
3051982 almost anything big that comes out in dog genomics elaine was somehow involved
3051983 and the ability to take advantage of well documented lineages maintained by constrained breeding makes the dog a powerful system for dissecting out genetic contributions to disease
3051984 elaine has carved out a very creative and productive scientific niche with her work on dog genetics and on human cancer and has emerged as one of the dominant leaders in both fields
3051985 if elaine hadnt been around i think the dog would be a second rate model that was studied by a handful of people who were only interested in pets
3051986 now the dog has made it on the charts as a unique species that provides special insights into evolutionary biology and also into human disease
3051987 so i wrote for an nih fellowship which got funded and identified a really outstanding lab at uc berkeley where i was going to do a second postdoc
3051988 but when i got to berkeley i discovered there wasnt going to be bench space available for several months i had already given up my apartment and more importantly my parking space which in boston forget it so there was no going back
3051989 so i said well if youll pay me ill come for six months and i can make the libraries and start developing genetic markers
3051990 i gave nih back their fellowship and i just stayed
3051991 so i wrote the white paper and it was successful on its first try
3051992 it took a lot of vision to see the potential of the dog as an interesting model for genetic studies
3051993 but then it took a huge amount of heavy lifting over many years to actually make it happen because there werent any genetic resources laying the foundation to getting the dog sequenced building genetic maps that required someone with a real stick to it iveness someone who could keep the faith i dont think the dog genome would have happened without elaine or certainly not as quickly or as effectively as it did
3051994 she single handedly got the dog on the agenda as one of the first species to get sequenced
3051995 that project involved over 1000 samples from 115 or 120 breeds
3051996 carlos and i would be lost doing that sort of thing on our own but elaine has kept us on track and provides the enthusiasm behind the whole thing
3051997 smoking is a big confounder so its been difficult to study the genetics of bladder cancer susceptibility in humans in dogs the picture is much clearer
3051998 i think the first slide in every seminar that every dog geneticist shows has a picture of a great dane and a chihuahua or an irish wolfhound and a toy poodle
3051999 so the question has been there forever what makes big dogs big and little dogs little
3052000 when i saw that signature i did get up and do a happy dance
3052001 i lost 50 bucks on that result because i was sure it was going to be growth hormone
3052002 and growth factor may still turn out to play a role but when you look at whats been under selection by breeders to make dogs small its clear that igf 1 jumps out as the number one starter out of the gate
3052003 every letter of every word has to be perfect thats why shes publishing in top journals its not just her reputation its the quality of her work
3052004 whether youre sick and tired of collecting sequence data or your paper needs to go through another draft shell work with you to keep it moving along
3052005 we had done a piece of research on addisons disease in portuguese water dogs
3052006 the journal thought the paper needed more work and i was ready to let it go but elaine said no way she was prepared to see that that paper got published no matter what shes absolutely fierce
3052007 she loves dogs and she has been able to take this passion and convert it to an area of research where shes at the forefront for her its not about fame and fortune and recognition

3052024 it continues the resurgence of the past several years and it accomplishes so many things
3052025 we hope to start on the parking deck by the end of august and have it completed by may 2009
3052026 we had been watching the downtown market for quite a while
3052027 it really came down to a lot of competing interests and obviously the best project has won
3052028 the public private partnership to get the parking garage done was a big key of it
3052029 we think this project is going to transform the look and feel of downtown make it more of a tourist destination

3052034 at another paramount theme park third day talked me into going on the top gun ride with them a frightening experience
3052035 wow these third day guys must be incredible even their guitar tech is a mighty man of god
3052036 leading a bible study with third day today supposedly didnt think newsboys bus would arrive at the venue in time got here with twenty minutes to spare washed and ate only to find all the guys in third day still asleep
3052037 for the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk but of power
3052038 but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from god and not from us
3052039 since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be destroyed let us be thankful and please god by worshiping him with holy fear and awe for our god is a consuming fire
3052040 theyre used to seeing things change little by little but this is far more dramatic
3052041 it gives you your own personal condo on the beach is how we look at it
3052042 what is your company the company you have worked so hard to build doing about protecting your data from employee theft or destruction
3052043 he said that sort of thing privately to people i knew
3052044 there was a fair amount of that i was annoyed enough to say so and he apologised for it a lot of good that did
3052045 he would go from prime minister meeting to president of country meeting and that was his sales model
3052046 and it didnt work absolutely not as we have learnt in the business world just because you have a handshake from the president or the prime minister it doesnt mean you have an order
3052047 it created enough hype and pictures of nicholas shaking hands with heads of state that back in taiwan where 250 engineers were working on it people felt part of something
3052048 we bought 5 000 new laptops for the kids of our country
3052049 and finally however impure it may be to the open sourcers putting windows on the xo was a huge breakthrough in the computing industry because microsoft has let them have windows xp for 3 per computer
3052050 companies still consider non catalog direct mail a crucial element in their media campaigns despite enormous growth in the online channels direct mail remains a key and integral component of direct marketing
3052051 tenemos que jugar concentradas todo el partido vamos a tener que mejorar en ese aspecto porque hoy cometimos un error y nos empataron cuando nosotras hab amos generado muchas m s situaciones de gol que ellas
3052052 en el segundo tiempo tuvimos casi todo el tiempo la pelota pero no supimos resolver frente al arco de ellas
3052053 generamos a lo largo del partido 12 c rners cortos y s lo concretamos uno en un partido cerrado como el de hoy ante un rival muy duro eso te juega en contra
3052054 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3052055 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3052056 theres no way you would describe this effort at this point as anything but an overwhelming success thats important for two reasons
3052057 there could be developers sitting on the fence wondering how effective the apple store would be at reaching consumers
3052058 now they can see that lots of applications have been sold so perhaps they should put theirs up there as well
3052059 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that
3052060 we think going forward the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
3052061 the problem is that the other platforms lack a central store that people can easily go to that theyve already done business with and make purchases quickly from the store to the device
3052062 youngsters need to learn all these things it is an art
3052063 den bewaffneten konflikt zu beenden und schnellstm glich einen friedensdialog zu beginnen
3052064 i ve had my eye on a number of retail stocks for some time now looking for signs of a potential turnaround and starbucks is now high on my lis
3052065 one of the main reasons for the slide in sbux shares from its high of 40 in november 2006 was the overly aggressive expansion plan
3052066 and as food and dairy prices have soared this has led to higher operating costs in turn this forced starbucks to raise prices just as consumers were struggling from the housing slump and soaring inflation
3052067 and as competition from the likes of mcdonalds and dunkin donuts has turned up the heat starbucks has suffered charges related to closing out unprofitable stores but starbucks is tackling the problems
3052068 declining sales along with its falling stock price has hit starbucks like a double shot of espresso at 7 00 am so the firm has gone back to basics launching its revival from the top
3052069 starbucks has re hired the man responsible for the company s success
3052070 his knowledge and experience should help greatly in turning starbucks around he wants to return to the company s roots the coffee the consumer and the starbucks experience more specifically schultz plans to reform starbucks in the following ways
3052071 i like what i hear about starbucks transformation but in the current environment the key to boosting business is pricing people are willing to pay for the starbucks experience as long as the price is within reason
3052072 schultz s strategy of soft pedaling growth in mature markets while investing more heavily overseas reminds me of the mcdonald s plan in the early 2000s it worked too its share price has more than quadrupled since 2003
3052073 and schultz s return has attracted some much bigger customers too
3052074 typically he pressures companies to focus on their core businesses and dump less profitable ventures
3052075 the return of schultz and his rebuilding plan along with investments by peltz and ainslie has had a positive effect on sbux shares over the last month
3052076 at the beginning of that year i gathered my team for an off site meeting to identify our top five risks for the coming 12 months we were paid to think about the downsides but it was hard to see where the problems would come from four years of falling credit spreads low interest rates virtually no defaults in our loan portfolio and historically low volatility levels it was the most benign risk environment we had seen in 20 years
3052077 no crisis comes completely out of the blue there are always clues and advance warnings if you can only interpret them correctly
3052078 israelis use them at home instead of traditional fixed line phones every 12 year old kid has a cell phone glued to their ear but the market still has room to grow the nations population is growing at almost 2 a year thanks to a continuous influx of new immigrants
3052079 the economy has grown over 5 a year for the past four years and a healthy economy means more people with more money to spend on wireless services and spend they do telecom services accounts for over 4 of the nations economy
3052080 only three major operators are competing in this hot market each claims a large percentage of the countrys wireless market but the one with the biggest piece of the pie is cellcom israel with over three million customers it controls over 34 of the wireless market
3052081 since new management took the reins in late 2005 the company has upgraded its network and launched a variety of cutting edge products and services
3052082 cellcoms ultra fast 3g wireless network allows customers to use their phones for more than just voice communication subscribers can now text message download music or video conference revenue from these new data applications climbed over 45 last year
3052083 the companys dividend policy is to distribute at least 75 of annual net income to shareholders in quarterly installments besides the regular dividend management also seeks to distribute at least 50 of earnings each year
3052084 over the past year the company paid out 3 93 per share including regular quarterly dividends of 2 43 and a special payout of 1 50 that gives the stock a yield of 11 8 of the recent share price
3052085 according to israeli tax law the company must deduct at ource 20 of the dividend amount payable to u s shareholders
3052086 however u s investors can claim a foreign tax credit for this amount against their federal income tax the dividend should qualify for the 15 reduced dividend tax rate making the stock suitable for a taxable account theres no dividend reinvestment plan
3052087 israel is hardly a safe haven geopolitically but it does offer shelter from the financial tsunami on wall street moreover company operations have remained unaffected by tensions in the middle east
3052088 earnings are forecast to grow over 20 this year and average 9 10 growth over the next few years largely due to the companys data service business
3052089 cellcoms shares have enjoyed total returns of more than 40 over the past year in a down market but are still attractively priced redinews unless otherwise indicated all data delayed by 15 20 minutes
3052090 i would do anything to keep people from going where i went this book was the only thing i could think of
3052091 its been a great few days for the side after all the commotion over his appointment as captain after michael vaughans resignation
3052092 the boys pulled together we had a chat and said how we wanted to play this fixture and i couldnt have asked for anything more
3052093 south africa played some real good cricket 2 1 is pretty right
3052094 at lords we had the upper hand and then south africa drummed it into us for the next seven or eight days at headingley and edgbaston
3052095 weve tried our hardest but at the start of this new era i couldnt ask for anything more
3052096 the big man had a fantastic game i would rather have seen him get man of the match for this fixture
3052097 with australia here next year its definitely the way me and coach peter moores want to play our cricket
3052098 we went slightly off the boil but you have to give credit to england they had a lot of motivation and a lot to prove
3052099 weve waited a long time for this moment we came with a goal of winning the series and im really chuffed to have done that
3052100 from where we started the series to where we ended at edgbaston i think we came a long way
3052101 im really proud of the guys because its been a real collective effort
3052102 my performance has been persistent without going on to get that hundred
3052103 im happy that i got four fifties but disappointed i didnt go on to get that big score after all hundreds win matches
3052104 i dont think i have been at my best this series but thats what happens when a few things creep into your game to score 300 runs and not be at your best is encouraging for me though
3052105 as a batsman you always want to better yourself and youre never happy
3052106 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3052107 earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife
3052108 sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night and i think im being filmed
3052109 over the past six months pilgrims pride has taken a number of proactive steps to strengthen our competitive position amid a very difficult operating environment
3052110 these steps include the production cutbacks for the second half of fiscal 2008 the closure of a plant in north carolina and seven distribution centers and the consolidation of our tray pack operations in el dorado ark to six other case ready sites
3052111 with labor day approaching and no indication that the actions taken to date by pilgrims pride or other industry members are having a positive effect on selling prices for our products it is now clear that more significant decisive action is necessary in addition epas disappointing decision to reject the request for a partial waiver of the 2008 renewable fuel standard for corn based ethanol assures that high grain prices are here to stay for the foreseeable future while we had sincerely hoped to avoid further facility closures or consolidations we recognize that we must do everything in our control to pass along higher input costs we believe the actions announced today while painful are needed to position pilgrims pride to emerge from this down cycle as a much stronger more efficient competitor
3052112 porn and literature have made for interesting bedfellows since the invention of papyrus and their boundaries frequently blur
3052113 cocoon es una peli gafe despu s de rodarla sus protagonistas empezaron a morirse
3052114 i think hes good at economics and thats what john mccain needs its the only thing hes lacking
3052115 he can run a business he can run the country
3052116 i think if he doesnt pick a conservative running mate hes going to have some conservatives that stay home and dont vote and that would be a real big mistake
3052117 i dont know much about him its a new name
3052118 rice could pull female and african american votes from obama
3052119 i think if you were going to take a week off this is probably an intelligent time to do it
3052120 if i can sleep in until about 7 30 or 8 then it really helps me
3052121 i think when i get up real early like 5 30 or 6 and dont go to bed until 10 10 30 or 11 it seems to help me get up a little later in the morning
3052122 hey i guess theyre right senior citizens although slow and dangerous behind the wheel can still serve a purpose ill be right back dont you go dying on me
3052123 i think if you were going to take a week off this is probably an intelligent time to do it
3052124 it says here on my agenda that we are to take some brief time to be creative that means we use the six thinking hats
3052125 if this helps minimize the total number of foreclosures then you begin to take some of that housing out of the market which begins to support the real estate market
3052126 the qualities of the landlords were all over the lot
3052127 anything that gives us an opportunity to help out the community is a good thing in my book
3052128 i get calls from people who are frustrated that the house next door to them is not being maintenanced
3052129 anything that the government does to assist first time home buyers is going to help the inland empire because our prices are in line with what first time home buyers can afford
3052130 nobody has that crystal ball to know whether this bill is too late or too early but its a positive step toward helping buyers and those who have defaults
3052131 we think theres some helpful components to the bill but we want some additional solutions such as requiring better reporting from mortgage servicers about loan modifications and allowing bankruptcy courts to supervise loan modifications
3052132 homeowners may already be eligible for help through the fha
3052133 they should contact us immediately especially if time is of the essence we already have housing counselors in pittsburgh ready to help
3052134 fha has always played a decent role in the pittsburgh market
3052135 when conventional loan guidelines were loosened and they became very competitive to fha the fha lost some of its areas of strength and therefore some of its influence
3052136 but it has always been around and i anticipate that this legislation will bring them back a little stronger again
3052137 you can also find a housing counselor in your neighborhood by calling that number
3052138 my mum and dad were saying it seems like two minutes since they used to take her to public swimming lessons at sherwood baths which is where she started
3052139 here they are watching one of their granddaughters win an olympic title it was just unbelievable for them
3052140 rebecca swims for shoes so im sure theres going to be a pair come her way
3052141 she also said if she won the gold medal when she comes back i had to promise to do her a sunday roast with yorkshire puddings
3052142 its just an absolutely fantastic achievement for her im so proud of her shes my new hero
3052143 i dont want to say i cruised it but i swam it the way i wanted to
3052144 i found that tough after this morning but it gets me into the semi finals i need to recover now and get into shape for the next phase
3052145 what the girls did this morning was so inspiring and this result has filled me with confidence
3052146 this team is building momentum all the time and its great to be a part of that
3052147 you can feel it flowing throughout the team and its giving us all confidence
3052148 sending people chasing to document that they should get an extension and having icf and lra staff reviewing as to entitlement to extensions is an unnecessary and counterproductive waste of time
3052149 leaving applicants with just 30 days to complete submissions is inadequate given how poorly icf has administered the road home program
3052150 in our experience about 90 percent of the homeowners with difficult succession matters are african american as a result it is clear that the impact of this change would disproportionately disqualify african americans from participating in this program
3052151 we are reaching out to people who are having trouble closing
3052152 i am not going to shut down the program but we do have to set some deadline
3052153 most americans agree we will never see cheap gas again
3052154 starting to make decisions big life decisions based on the assumption that cheap gas is not part of the future
3052155 we were thinking this way when gas was 1 99 a gallon
3052156 for us its about quality of life who wants to spend time sitting in traffic to go to a local restaurant or bar or whatever when you can have great things that are in your neighborhood
3052157 what happened is we started investing in a system of streets and highways that made it easier for people to own personal vehicles
3052158 while biofuels will be responsible for a significant share of added demand for commodities in the coming years food will remain by far the primary consumer
3052159 looking ahead particularly at energy crops the overall supply and demand situation for the future remains delicately balanced with a number of the worlds major grain oilseed and sugar markets heavily reliant on more normal seasonal conditions in the coming years to ensure adequate production response to meet strong demand growth
3052160 challenging in the sense that both food and non food demand for agricultural production will continue to increase against limited resources promising as industries continue to innovate to improve factors such as yields productivity and long term sustainability
3052161 es una l stima que algunos de nuestros aliados no nos ayuden y traten incluso de molestarnos con esto me refiero sobre todo al desplazamiento del contingente militar de georgia en irak a la zona de conflicto oseta por estados unidos y sus aviones de transporte militar
3052162 estos son de gran importancia ya que nos ayuda a corregir las fallas que tenemos en cuanto al concepto de cooperativa y c mo se debe administrar ya que no ten amos mucha orientaci n sobre el tema
3052163 when we eat breakfast in the morning well eat it at our house
3052164 poor boy had a tough time of it didnt he
3052165 why would anyone put a beautiful st bernard on death row was he a biter did he attack young kids
3052166 extreme and unusual hardship because he has a young child
3052167 en territorio georgiano muy alejado de la separatista osetia del sur aunque con el fin declarado de impedir nuevos ataques georgianos contra esa zona
3052168 para impedir los ataques de las tropas georgianas contra osetia del sur y la reagrupaci n de sus unidades que participan en las acciones b licas contra osetia del sur
3052169 impedir la concentraci n de unidades de reservistas movilizados por el presidente georgiano mija l saakashvili para continuar los combates
3052170 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3052171 this election is about not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3052172 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3052173 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3052174 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named
3052175 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3052176 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3052177 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3052178 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about
3052179 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3052180 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3052181 die sehr gute entwicklung des operativen gesch fts die z gige integration von broadnet und die beendigung des netzerweiterungsprojekts stimmen mich f r die kommenden quartale optimistisch
3052182 wir sind im netzwerk kurz davor die gewinnschwelle zu berschreiten
3052183 philips freut sich dass die z lle im oktober auslaufen da dies im besten interesse europas der verbraucher und der umwelt ist
3052184 maybe this is what grace is the unseen sounds that make you look up i think its why we are here to see as many chips of blue sky as we can bear to find the diamond hearts within one anothers meatballs to notice flickers of the divine like dust motes on sunbeams in your dusty kitchen without all the shade and shadows youd miss the beauty of the veil the shadow is always there and if you dont remember it when it falls on you and your life again youre plunged into darkness shadows make the light show
3052185 we are going to wait for the final election results to see how much the voting is affected if 1 896 votes in baiwas and tumahubong will affect the results then we will need to hold special elections there
3052186 we didnt receive any untoward incidents to disrupt the elections
3052187 however this was partially offset by the p2 billion net repayments and p6 billion net appreciation of the third currencies against the us dollar
3052188 the increase was attributed to the foreign contingent debt due to the combined effects of the p19 billion depreciation of the peso against the us dollar p3 billion net appreciation of the third currencies against the us dollar and p2 billion net repayments
3052189 we are already down 25 basis points due to easing inflation expectations
3052190 yields should range trade after that unless we see a further drop in oil prices
3052191 i think right now the market is pricing in a 25 basis point hike after that the market is slowly ruling our more rate hikes because of improving oil prices
3052192 this developed as the investment environment turned more cautious due to concerns about global financial market fragilities and the downturn in many advanced economies including the us
3052193 foreign investors continue to sell whatever the result of wall street is this means they are getting out of the philippine market and are looking for more stable countries
3052194 the market remains cautious because a huge number of the players are foreign filipinos who remain highly speculative should learn to invest and play in the market otherwise the volume would not go up
3052195 the only good thing in the market is there is still activity there are still those who are willing to take their chances
3052196 it is safe to invest in the stock market given that most of the stocks are already undervalued
3052197 investors should nevertheless examine these companies fundamentals and growth potential before investing
3052198 we will leave the other networks to argue which tv station is number one we at tv5 will be content to be a strong third in the industry
3052199 if we could make it to second that would be a bonus
3052200 we believe that abs cbn and gma are both doing well in serving their respective markets so we decided to focus our efforts to the market segment that do not like to watch local drama series one after the other every night
3052201 we believe there is room for another tv channel and that we can attract a sizeable audience by providing a fresh alternative to the countrys two major networks which seem to mirror each others programming
3052202 we hope to provide shows that are different and more relevant to a youthful filipino audience
3052203 we realize that our target market is an active segment that may not have the time to try to follow something on a daily basis
3052204 as such our schedule is based more on appointment television with provisions for catch up or replays of certain shows on weekends allowing people the flexibility to watch our programs when it is convenient for them
3052205 right now our main goal is to provide fresh and relevant programming to our target audiences more than anything else this is where we want to concentrate our efforts because we want to ensure that we are able to satisfy tv viewers
3052206 i am also happy to say that tv5 aims to be instrumental in growing the local creative community by providing a platform for many independent pinoy producers talents and artists to practice their creativity and skills
3052207 all these make tv5 one of the best platforms for those seeking a reprieve from what the usual philippine tv landscape offers
3052208 tv5 promises to be your home on television which shall shake your tv viewing habits in a way that no other tv channel does
3052209 with tv5s new programming that provides viewers with much more choices
3052210 the changes that have taken place are of considerable importance and varied in nature in the first place there is the rapid increase in population which has made many fear that world population is going to grow faster than available resources with the consequence that many families and developing countries would be faced with greater hardships this can easily induce public authorities to be tempted to take even harsher measures to avert this danger there is also the fact that not only working and housing conditions but the greater demands made both in the economic and educational field pose a living situation in which it is frequently difficult these days to provide properly for a large family
3052211 the attitude of what is mine is mine absolutely and i can do with it as i wish or the belief that my money entitles me to consume or control on my own terms as much as my money will buy is not permissible at all
3052212 jason finished that race way better than we could have even asked for
3052213 the last 10 to 15 meters were incredible i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional after that
3052214 i didnt go in planning to break the world record im very excited it was a great swim she said
3052215 its kind of weird because when you are little you dream of being famous its weird to become that person you dont expect it to happen to you
3052216 we may be using webcams and internet technologies but youre still trying to find that chemistry
3052217 and if it isnt there you just move on to the next person
3052218 if people decide they dont like someone they usually know within 30 seconds
3052219 if you meet someone you like three minutes isnt long enough if you dont like them 30 seconds is too long
3052220 if you see someone you like in real life you dont go up to them with your resum and compare you just talk
3052221 i wanted to be a little ridiculous and put myself out there
3052222 my mom said the more places you put your resum the better chance you have for finding a job i figured id do the same thing with dating
3052223 eight to 10 of our users have been to real dating sites
3052224 were more about meeting new friends not necessarily meeting new dates
3052225 the dating stories are good to hear and weve got plenty of them
3052226 20 year old kid trapped in a 47 year old mans body
3052227 from the beginning of third day we realized that we needed to have someone to speak into our lives as individuals and as a band through the years we have had many people pastors and friends travel with us but of all those people nigel james has been the most important he has allowed us and reminded us to be men of god first and as a result our music and ministry have reflected that nigel has kept us accountable to each other to the church and of course to our lord he has helped us to grow in our faith and has reminded us to stay focused on our calling and on what third day is really all about
3052228 how did you get the job of third days road pastor
3052229 for just as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts
3052230 at another paramount theme park third day talked me into going on the top gun ride with them a frightening experience
3052231 wow these third day guys must be incredible even their guitar tech is a mighty man of god
3052232 leading a bible study with third day today supposedly didnt think newsboys bus would arrive at the venue in time got here with twenty minutes to spare washed and ate only to find all the guys in third day still asleep
3052233 for the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk but of power
3052234 but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from god and not from us
3052235 since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be destroyed let us be thankful and please god by worshiping him with holy fear and awe for our god is a consuming fire
3052236 i have zealously served the lord god almighty but the people of israel have broken their covenant with you torn down your altars and killed every one of your prophets i am the only one left and now they are trying to kill me too
3052237 i have zealously served the lord god almighty but the people of israel have broken their covenant with you torn down your altars and killed every one of your prophets i am the only one left and now they are trying to kill me too
3052238 dat gebeurt helaas wel vaker het probleem is dat het rioolstelsel bij een grote flinke bui het niet meer aankan we moeten dit wel doen om te zorgen dat we droge voeten houden
3052239 met een dag of twee vind je er niets meer van terug
3052240 nou het smaakt me anders helemaal niet als jij steeds te laat thuis bent
3052241 zie je wel ik kan ook niks ik ben te achterlijk om dat vol te houden
3052242 ik zou eigenlijk dat moeten doen is me niet gelukt maar ach dat komt later wel goed ik weet dat als ik me ertoe zet ik het kan
3052243 of we begrijpen elkaar niet of we horen elkaar gewoon niet
3052244 het helpt toch niet allemaal onzin dan gaat ze zeker zeggen wat ik allemaal aan mezelf moet veranderen als je in therapie gaat met zn twee n wordt het recept voor een scheiding klaargemaakt

3052388 florida has a great legacy in aerospace a great foundation to build on and that is one more reason we are so committed to expanding our capability to launch from florida and from the united states
3052389 we have worked closely with the air force over the past several months and look forward to a strong long term relationship as we build these safe commercial launch processes together
3052390 the air force assignment of launch complex 36 is an important next step to extending access to space making it available to defense and security initiatives and multiple commercial payload and launch activities for both civil and private space businesses that wish to launch from florida
3052391 the florida legislature demonstrated tremendous foresight when it appropriated initial funding of 14 5 million for fy 2009 this funding will help space florida begin the launch complex infrastructure design and construction necessary to develop a true commercial multi use launch complex this direction by the air force together with the tremendous support by the state opens the door to attracting supporting and sustaining national and international aerospace business here in florida
3052392 one of space floridas next objectives is to establish a commercial launch zone clz for commercial customers wishing to operate from the eastern range the creation of a clz expands our ability to support commercial payload launch services re supply missions to the international space station and aggressively diversify aerospace business development rapidly and efficiently
3052393 the assignment of launch complex 36 will be an important milestone and part of a broader strategy to establish a clz at the cape

3052397 the best part about the project is that the detector was built from everyday materials and launched into near space from right here in our own backyard this proves you can accomplish really amazing things with simple materials
3052398 the proposal encourages facilitates and harnesses entrepreneurial space achievement enabling a dynamic globally competitive commercial space sector is in line with national policy and is mutually beneficial to the air force and the state
3052399 we take great pride in fostering a vibrant commercial space sector and expect the spirit of innovation and attitude of cooperation that made this idea into a reality to be prevalent in the years to come

3052401 it was thought that looking back in the past earlier galaxies would not have generated much magnetic field
3052402 the results of this study show that the magnetic fields within milky way like galaxies have been every bit as strong over the last two thirds of the universes age as they are now and possibly even stronger then
3052403 there must be some other explanation for a much quicker and earlier amplification of galactic magnetic fields
3052404 from the time when the first stars and galaxies formed their magnetic fields have probably have been amplified by very fast dynamos one good possibility is that it happened in the explosive outflows that were driven by supernovae and possibly even black holes in the very earliest generations of galaxies

3052456 during that time the company was a provider of handset basebands modems inside a phone which really became a commodity business it was also in the pc power management businesses which was also a drag on the overall growth of the company
3052457 the good news is that during the first quarter adi got out of these businesses and has taken steps to move from single digital earning growth to double digit growth adi looks set to deliver double digit growth of 13 five year cagr much ofthat growth is coming from its communications business
3052458 wireless carriers have been upgrading to third generation 3g networks over the past year and many now are focusing their sites on building fourth generation 4g networks as well as wimax networks
3052459 with each move up the idea is to provide higher data rates allowing for more applications to run at once and for higher quality pictures and video as a result i think this stock looks very attractive
3052460 the biggest part of adis analog business is products for its industrial and communications business which account for 72 of revenues within this business adis wireless base station revenues grew significantly over the past year
3052461 manufacturers of base stations which are radio receiver transmitters that serve as the hub of the local wireless network have been td scdma the chinese version of 3g equipment
3052462 i believe the shares should soon be trading at the upper end of their historical trading range i expect adi to generate eps of 2 06 in 2009 at 26 times earnings that would give a price target of 53 per share
3052463 its designed to reflect the true cost of providing service to different classes of customers and also to encourage conservation
3052464 in general the cost of service study we performed was the first one weve ever done this one uses modern accounting principles
3052465 residential customers as a class and seasonal customers in particular are causing our seasonal usage peaks
3052466 but residentials that use very little water 50 gallons per day is our new minimum 100 used to be will see a 24 percent decrease a single family home using 500 gallons or more per day will see an increase of five percent or more
3052467 i encourage people to seek alternative water sources for irrigation during peak season
3052468 large commercials will pay more many small commercials will see a significant decrease
3052469 the seasonal accounts have more operating costs because they exacerbate peak demand
3052470 they are also more costly administratively because we have to close them out and then reopen them each year
3052471 only 10 percent of our users will see an increase over 2 percent
3052472 ninety percent were using 250 gallons or less per day the highest increase is about 28 percent for customers that use 1 500 gallons per day
3052473 put another way the governor takes money from hospitals and gives it back to them and in doing so creates the illusion that there is a deficit in the upl program
3052474 there are too big problems with this its still a 90 million tax on hospitals no matter how its twisted
3052475 why would you go through this much trouble when all you have to do is increase revenue with a popular tax
3052476 hey im going to spend eight hours staring at my computer screen cause im in a ev situation
3052477 see honey i had a flush which is like a really good hand and
3052478 ossetia and the ossetians received their name from the russians who used the georgian term oseti for the iranian speaking emphasis mine inhabitants of the central part of the caucasus the term became popular and was accepted by the ossetians themselves already before they were integrated into the russian empire at the same time the ossetians retained their internal division into a few sub groups with their own names in ossetian in northern ossetia they are the irons in the east and the digors in the west yet the ossetians lacked any single inclusive name for themselves in their own language and for a long time they felt comfortable with the name given to them by the georgians and russians this practice was put into question by the new ossetian nationalism
3052479 all this is not to mention that a us airlift of 2000 georgian troops to fight russian ones
3052480 all the news you never knew you needed to know until now
3052481 i wanted to try and work illustrations into some of the photographs i liked from the content we were given
3052482 i just took phrases that i connected with the images whether they were lyrics from songs i was listening to or a line that i heard in passing i wanted to keep it really simple and just have the illustration burning through
3052483 and pantone systems architecture engineering physics anything that i can graphic design nerd out on really
3052484 with illustration work i normally develop my ideas on the spot
3052485 i am very impulsive i dont like planning for hours first i discuss what the client wants and i like to put things on paper straightaway i normally sketch something out very quickly and then tackle it head on and go straight in with the ink it normally works out for the best this way with my hand drawn work i focus on intense detail layering colour and line i love finding new patterns shapes and letterforms to experiment with
3052486 i can spend weeks researching a project before i even start to visualise it there is a lot of thought behind every idea i like to start with a conceptual seed and develop ideas from there gestalt theory for example was the start of all of my isometric patterns and shapes the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts started the isometric building experiments that have flooded my work since
3052487 isomorph is a new company ive set up to act as an umbrella to any publishing or side project i choose to start
3052488 i will also be publishing a couple of books in the new year the record label part of isomorph was constructed to create vinyl only releases for existing bands as a chance for a collaboration between musicians and designers i aim to work on a series of releases designing an aesthetic for each album single
3052489 where most labels would scrimp and save isomorph aims to indulge in all aspects of vinyl releases creating collectors editions in small print numbers
3052490 i have designed a range of six garments which have all been hand drawn and coloured using letraset markers
3052491 each piece will be completely unique with only a few hundred of each being made
3052492 so i can focus on my work and start having some time off
3052493 i can accept the fact that some would not understand linas public self exploration because they in fact lead un examined lives
3052494 the companies insist that nothing is wrong but the complaints have been mounting through e mails water cooler discussions and message boards on apples own web site iphone 3g users are having trouble connecting and staying connected to the 3g networks in their areas
3052495 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
3052496 where is rodney dangerfield when we need him there are some heated
3052497 this means the considerable amount of online gt gt gt video available to other users is out of reach of the linux crowd
3052498 you wonder why theyd want to kiss off 2 3 gt gt gt of the desktops
3052499 youll get that in this business with modern journalism but its possible were trying
3052500 we have one or two options were looking at and hopefully we can get something done before the start of the season
3052501 we had dominated possession and had good chances in the match
3052502 but if youre making chances as many as we made today you shouldnt worry about it
3052503 the team has got to realise what quality ball weve got to give them
3052504 if juan hernandez the wonderful five eights arguably as good a player as daniel carter had been playing the pumas would have certainly scored a couple of tries during their period of
3052505 a lot of guys put up their hands and i want to make it clear that the springbok door is not shut to anyone
3052506 there is a time to come and a time to go
3052507 it is a strong possibility that we reduce it two venues karachi and lahore
3052508 that didnt provide us an opportunity to check the security arrangements so there was no way we can formulate an opinion on rawalpindi
3052509 its not proper for me to single out any one person in the meeting
3052510 we all share the same concerns we have to ensure the safety of the players the media and the concerns were all common
3052511 if juan hernandez the wonderful five eights arguably as good a player as daniel carter had been playing the pumas would have certainly scored a couple of tries during their period of
3052512 a lot of guys put up their hands and i want to make it clear that the springbok door is not shut to anyone
3052513 there is a time to come and a time to go
3052514 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3052515 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3052516 second what will the americans and eu do a senior state department figure was here in tbilisi last week and i would expect that the georgian side at least hinted very broadly about what was up he would have to deny that of course in the way of these things we can assume that the americans did not warn them off
3052517 the big lebowski has been an unprecedented fan favorite since it made its theatrical debut a decade ago and its popularity shows no signs of slowing down
3052518 the films devoted followers are among the most avid and loyal weve ever seen this special 10th anniversary edition is both a tribute and a response to their unbelievable support for the film

3052525 obviously sergio followed it up with a great shot but i had the opportunity to get the putt in first
3052526 i knew if i holed this i probably would win the pga if i missed sergio would probably win so it was down to that and i hit a lovely putt
3052527 at birkdale british open i was quite assured of what i was doing here i really didnt know
3052528 i wasnt happy with how i was swinging the club this week in terms of my focus or maybe dehydration or tiredness but something had me a little bit off stride
3052529 my co ordination wasnt quite there my game was going downhill very quickly once i got to the weekend and holed a few putts it really was a question of adrenalin keeping me going
3052530 its a bit like the greg norman story at birkdale where norman finished third
3052531 its a great story but you cant let yourself get drawn into it youve got to be very selfish in this situation when youre on the course
3052532 i had to convince myself not to get into this sentimental thing of maybe its his turn maybe he deserves it maybe its his day
3052533 the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
3052534 i feel like i have played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career unfortunately it hasnt happened but that doesnt mean im not on the right track
3052535 if juan hernandez the wonderful five eights arguably as good a player as daniel carter had been playing the pumas would have certainly scored a couple of tries during their period of
3052536 a lot of guys put up their hands and i want to make it clear that the springbok door is not shut to anyone

3052538 kein neues argument in europas geschichte zur rechtfertigung von interventionen
3052539 ich konnte es erst gar nicht fassen und musste testen ob die auch echt ist aber jetzt wei ich dass alles realit t ist
3052540 es w re sch n wenn unsere sportart noch etwas mehr aufmerksamkeit in der ffentlichkeit bekommt das h tten wir verdient
3052541 den vierten sprung haben wir verpatzt aber das haben wir zum gl ck schnell abgehakt
3052542 vor dem letzten sprung war es verdammt eng wir hatten schon ein bisschen sorge dass es nur zu platz vier reichen w rde
3052543 mein ziel ist es sch ne spr nge zu zeigen dann wird man sehen was dabei herauskommt
3052544 er beherrscht die schwierigste serie der welt wenn er keine allzu gro en fehler macht kann er ganz vorne landen

3052548 the original format went bust two or three years ago 2006 it was very big and it was hard work but it was a real show and it was a stage for you to present what is coming up in the next year it was an important event today you know all they did is handed it out to nvision nvision is the new e3 and you can quote me on that old e3 was celebration of gaming while this new e3 stopped being that we feel that the time is right to offer gamers celebration of gaming once again
3052549 es waren nur meine mutter und mein bester freund florian orterer dabei ich bin total berw ltigt
3052550 einer steht f r boris und einer f r mich
3052551 es ist uns absolut ernst mit unserer beziehung wir fliegen jetzt nach new york um das alles zu verdauen und planen dann unsere hochzeit
3052552 ich werde in meinem leben noch einmal heiraten ganz sicher
3052553 wir haben mit der zeit einfach gemerkt dass wir f r verschiedene lebensmodelle stehen
3052554 ich kann nicht jeder frau in die ich verliebt bin nach einem halben jahr einen heiratsantrag machen bevor es zu entt uschungen kommt mache ich lieber reinen tisch
3052555 becker und die frauen sind ein beliebtes dauerthema f r die boulevardpresse
3052556 es gibt keine spannenden skandale und somit auch keine spektakul re erkl rung f r mein ausscheiden sondern schlicht verschiedene ziele w nsche und entwicklungen die zu dem entschluss gef hrt haben die weiteren wege getrennt zu gehen denn dem gl ck der oder eben des anderen im wege zu stehen verbietet der gegenseitige respekt und w rde keinem der beteiligten und auch dem langen gemeinsamen weg nicht gerecht
3052557 i do believe that in the coming few years we are still growing very fast here
3052558 the european market is one of the biggest in the world very strategic to the company so we put more investment in and we believe we will have a better and better position here
3052559 if we improved access to contraceptives there would be a reduction in abortion
3052560 no doctor would ever tell a woman that abortion was one of the choices she should rely on for contraception
3052561 if we improved access to contraceptives there would be a reduction in abortion
3052562 ive never had a patient who took the decision to end a pregnancy cavalierly
3052563 it is obvious that as world champions our biggest strengths are in the lineout and in the scrum
3052564 and it is precisely here where the opposition will try and neutralize us
3052565 the all blacks use tactics which are illegal and as far as i know if it is illegal then it is not allowed
3052566 we have picked up three things that they do which are illegal in the lineouts
3052567 it starts with their flanker coming through the lineout illegally to stop any ball thrown down to the scrumhalf they also do their best to play the lineout jumpers in the air and jump across the line and then thirdly they manage to close the gap to a half a meter between the two sets of players
3052568 all i know is that if there is a rule and if it applies to one team it applies to both teams
3052569 the referee has to blow according to the rules and not according to his interpretation its that simple
3052570 if i looked at reserve scrumhalf and i have to choose between ruan pienaar and fourie du preez and i sent fourie back i would have to have my head read
3052571 the same goes in a decision between jaque fourie and frans steyn i told ruan and frans it is great to have you here but if fourie or jaque are back then you are at the back of the queue again
3052572 i told them you can go back and decide where you want to play but with every decision there is a responsibility and that responsibility is that if you choose to play flyhalf you must know there are players ahead of you
3052573 the same goes for scrumhalf there you must know bolla conradie fourie and ricky januarie are all ahead of you
3052574 ruan is a very good player but as a scrumhalf i have to ask if he does all the basic things that a scrumhalf has to do
3052575 this is what i look for and i have to be honest about these things if ruan and frans were playing badly then it would be easier but they arent playing badly
3052576 a lot of guys put up their hands and i want to make it clear that the springbok door is not shut to anyone
3052577 there is a time to come and a time to go i am looking to the next four years and some people may find that their time to go is earlier than expected
3052578 if juan hernandez the wonderful five eights arguably as good a player as daniel carter had been playing the pumas would have certainly scored a couple of tries during their period of
3052579 a lot of guys put up their hands and i want to make it clear that the springbok door is not shut to anyone
3052580 there is a time to come and a time to go
3052581 we enquired about him but ive enquired about a lot of players ive known clinton a long time it was discussed between his agent and us but he was not coming to wolves
3052582 he didnt turn us down and we didnt not decide to take him if i signed every player i enquired about id have 563 players here
3052583 he did really well but it was against stafford rangers hes certainly got qualities but hes 5ft 11ins stroke six foot and in this division it makes a difference
3052584 we love a good party and coppice park is a great venue this was a chance for the whole community to come out get together and enjoy themselves
3052585 the writing style which is most natural for you is bound to echo the speech you heard when a child
3052586 i believe so strongly that not only is the wps going to be an incredible product for the world to see but will be an absolute necessity for our players in the usa to continue competing against the worlds best on a regular basis
3052587 from freddy adus tricky dribbles to sacha kljestans dangerous runs to jozy altidores burgeoning promise as a big game striker to michael bradleys composure and presence in the middle of the field the u s team provided ample evidence that this country is producing skilled soccer players and progressing beyond the disappointment of the 2006 world cup
3052588 i keep reminding myself that my disappointment is a measure of how far weve come
3052589 and that wont change until i know what happens against nigeria moreover even if we tie nigeria and come in second in the group it will feel like a loss if we lose to argentina in the quarters
3052590 we have some motivated wives that want to start up a support group for people in the lincoln and logan county area
3052591 this is not a military group this is just us wanting to do this
3052592 for those who have members who are currently deployed or who have been deployed or who are going to be deployed
3052593 we want to offer information and emotional support to all of the families in our area we want to talk about things and get together and plan care packages hopefully we will continue to meet after theyre home
3052594 there are people who want to help out but dont know how
3052595 maybe we can plan activities and spend time with people who are in the same situation
3052596 but theyre setting the group up on their own im just a part of it as a local community member
3052597 not everybody in the community puts on a uniform it can be isolating to them and the same can be true to their spouses
3052598 its important for the community to reach out this is not a military base where a support system already exists but we have a loving and caring community
3052599 when they found out jeremy is deploying they gave us a 50 percent scholarship
3052600 now the community has an opportunity to make good on that night
3052601 for me the big thing is knowing that im not doing it alone
3052602 that my bad days are somebody elses bad days too
3052603 we would like to make sure that all of those families are brought together maybe people deployed before can come in and help them
3052604 we want to build a whole group of people who communicate with each other
3052605 we have the backing of the mayor her son is on his second deployment already
3052606 they need it people need it this is a length of time when a significant member of the family is gone and the other member of the family has to do everything
3052607 im willing to talk or to help but im not a psychologist
3052608 if we feel this way surely other people do too
3052609 i happened to see the papers about a contest for the pin
3052610 its supposed to be three kids with their hand on their hearts looking at a flag with a gazebo in the background
3052611 silver dollar city opens the park every day with a flag raising ceremony we always go and we make the kids put their hands on their heart down there theyre really into honoring the flag and patriotism
3052612 this year it will only be three times were cutting back because of gas prices we have season passes to silver dollar city so we try to go down for the festivals
3052613 i dont know if they realize what theyre asking people to do
3052614 i come from a large family weve got relatives all over the states
3052615 we thought that would allow them enough time to get their ducks in a row
3052616 i was not happy but what are you going to do

3052644 sweet girl i promise you that if you write ill get your letter
3052645 you promised something that wont happen now all shell remember is the last thing you told her was a lie

3052648 sarah how do you know i cant get tammys letter in heaven
3052649 joshua campbell youre talking foolishness now must be the medication
3052650 what if it isnt foolishness sarah will you promise me youll do this
3052651 okay josh ill do it but only because i think you want to remind everyone that you delivered mail for thirty years
3052652 can i put the letter in the mailbox and raise the flag so grandpa will know that he has mail tammy was so excited
3052653 look grandma the flags down that means grandpa got the letter
3052654 some days we dont get anything but most days ol ed johnson has to drive out and deliver mail to miss minas box if wed known ahead of time i wouldve interred her in row 12 right by the entrance for no additional charge but who knew miss minad get so much mail
3052655 shes got her own address and everything plot 198 a2q in care of marsh amp longfellow mortuary i find the legal notices the funniest after all whos going to sue a dead woman
3052656 we need to make sure that our clients are not defrauded and people realize that death will not stop us from pursuing our claims against mrs brewers estate
3052657 heck if need be well dig up her bones and sell them to a medical school at least well make a few bucks that way and the thought of medical students playing practical jokes with her spleen or wrist deep in her hootus may convince the next old lady not to pull a stunt like this
3052658 you know she would think its a hoot grandma had a great sense of humor
3052659 yes but maybe burying her dribbler glass and whoopee cushion with her was going far enough
3052660 perhaps but mom and dad were often on the receiving end of grandmas jokes they might not like our gesture as much
3052661 oh please they just never appreciated grandmas sense of humor the way we did remember how she teased them about being too stodgy for their own good
3052662 she really earned the mailbox madame title engraved on her tombstone
3052663 she told me not a day went by that she didnt drop something in the mail to someone who needed it whether it was a note of encouragement a requested recipe a humorous cartoon or a prankster letter she used the u s postal service to spread her cheer
3052664 after my divorce she sent me a note every day for months letting me know she loved me without question or judgment
3052665 lets see its been about seven years since my car accident grandma either visited or mailed me funny cards with jokes and riddles every day afterwards
3052666 you know her all time funniest use of the mail system dont you
3052667 who would have thought of mailing each invitation with individual instructions to dress as a character from a specific movie
3052668 mom showed up as the green faced wicked witch of the west from the wizard of oz and dad
3052669 and dad posing as winnie the pooh carrying a honey pot and wearing a short red t shirt that did not quite cover his belly
3052670 they realized grandmas prank when they saw the rest of us dressed as characters from serious classics
3052671 i did do justice to gone with the wind didnt i
3052672 i could use you this week what do i tell him
3052673 i was very firm with vladimir putin he and i have got a good relationship just like i was firm with the russian president
3052674 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn you know bombing outside of south ossetia
3052675 it was just interesting to me that here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
3052676 in the long run america better remain engaged with china and understand that we can have a cooperative and constructive yet candid relationship

3052782 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3052783 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3052784 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3052785 she came to check on him and found him deceased in a bedroom
3052786 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3052787 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3052794 we trying to get that fight so bad its a shame because we know we cant get it we know he aint going to fight us he aint got nobody to fight and we aint got nobody to fight so why is he calling out zab and clottey we already know what it is they trying to say margaritos looking for money fights or whatever but they aint going to let me jump on him again
3052795 the take home message here is its a big deal
3052796 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3052797 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3052798 rather infamous characters in u s history and for good reason honestly whats sexier than a nefarious duo driving cross country on a crime spree of such massive and public proportion

3052828 were there to listen to understand what happened sunday night and to avoid these kinds of situations
3052829 i think the rain this last day and a half helped but the first two days when we got here i was struggling with the pollution the heat the humidity
3052830 you could really feel it in your lungs when you started to breathe heavily
3052831 i did not think it was going to be like that i have yet to see blue sky or sun i thought maybe there was going to be a small smog layer in patches but its literally a haze
3052832 weve managed to adapt to the situation from home to china
3052833 there is some pollution but for me everything about the environment i just take it out i dont want an excuse i cant control the enviornment and the pollution i havent tried any different things like a mask because in the race you have to do the race without the mask

3052847 what the people of georgia have accomplished in terms of democratic governance a western orientation and domestic reform is nothing short of remarkable
3052848 in recent days moscow has sent its tanks and troops across the internationally recognized border into the georgian region of south ossetia
3052849 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia
3052850 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3052851 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe it is time we moved forward with a number of steps
3052852 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3052853 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation
3052854 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3052855 the u s should work with azerbaijan and turkey and other interested friends to develop plans to strengthen the security of the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline

3052861 studies are showing that the addition of fluoride to municipal water supplies is having little effect on oral health
3052862 instead the recent studies provide mounting evidence that fluoride can adversely affect the neurological development of children
3052863 so technically were still in the experimental stage after 60 years
3052864 has been controlled for far too long by the dental lobby
3052865 theyre preoccupied by one tissue the teeth whereas the opponents of fluoridation like myself see the body slightly differently
3052866 i believe health canada is not giving the citizens the truth on this issue
3052867 no studies have investigated a possible relationship between fluoridated water and lower iqs in children arthritic symptoms in adults underactive thyroid glands increased bone fractures in children and earlier onset of puberty
3052868 the science has not been done in canada if you dont look you dont find
3052869 i think there is a very strong case for the precautionary removal of this mass medication from our drinking water
3052870 there are studies which show changes in iq from populations exposed to fluoride in drinking water the thing is if you look at an individual you never really know that they may have been five points higher on the iq scale
3052871 we rely on science and expert reports from around the world
3052872 so while we at the cda have not ourselves conducted research on the iq of children in canada based on studies from around the world the uk and the united states we feel very confident in supporting water fluoridation

3053112 a comprehensive shift in ecological character is under way without significant and urgent intervention it may prove irreversible
3053113 its a tragedy that the warning bells that we sounded very loud back then were seemingly ignored
3053114 everything has dramatically worsened it is so far off the scale ecologically that it is a crisis
3053115 are conducting an operation to prevent firing on south ossetia and on russian peacekeepers by georgian artillery and the regrouping of georgian forces aimed at new aggression towards south ossetia
3053116 russian forces have occupied the senaki military base which was abandoned
3053117 we are not moving beyond the boundaries on principle russian peacekeeping forces do not have the task of invading georgian territory
3053118 tbilisi was bombed bombs hit the village of kojori and makhata mountain
3053119 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3053120 it seems that this will not change anything but will move us away from resolving the situation
3053121 saddam hussein of course needed to be hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3053122 but not the current georgian leadership which in less than an hour drove tanks through children and old people burned people alive in their homes these leaders need to be protected
3053123 if you are on the enemys side or you are being used by enemies stop it
3053124 when somebody makes you turn against each other you dont say we are no longer family members
3053125 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
3053126 14 hours of discussion means there is some kind of disagreement if it was an agreement it would have been in two hours
3053127 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3053128 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3053129 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3053130 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3053131 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3053132 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3053133 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3053134 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3053135 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3053136 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3053137 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3053138 then i thought thats ridiculous this is an olympic games you have to go for it
3053139 jason finished that race way better than we could have even asked for

3053143 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3053144 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3053145 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3053146 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3053147 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3053148 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3053149 data pukes that provide little in terms of context and even less in terms of actionable value
3053150 as a result of this trend up or down what was the impact on the company and its customers
3053151 this is not a dashboard it is the result of a massive sum of money paid to a consultant who is trying to impress you with his her excel skills
3053152 im part of a team and today was no different
3053153 i got with the guys and said were not a 4 by 100 team

3053157 moses saved from the water it has certificate of authenticity in exellant cond
3053158 nation of whiners remark is a killer it attacks the people themselves this idea being floated that obama is a pessimist really smells like an effort to conflate a skepticism of republican polices with a skepticism of america as a country in other words more of the same
3053159 on the day that you were born on the day that you were born
3053160 arent you conceding the point that for people who were there in the late 60s aretha stevie wonder coming of age whats going on james brown inventing funk etc hip hop has precious little to offer
3053161 that said the ad reaches the sweet spot that obama needs to hit again and again mccain is and must promise his base a bush 3rd term we should see that hug so many times before november the country should be able to sketch it from memory
3053162 the closest ive ever been to being an undecided voter was when freddy ferrer ran against bloomberg
3053163 we are now awaiting the official presentation of the medal to us this will also be announced by ioc
3053164 at first jerome young a member of the relay squad had tested positive to banned substances and therefore ineligible to have been allowed to compete during the event but went ahead to take part
3053165 again another member of the squad antonio pettigrew admitted to using drugs though he was not detected
3053166 i am happy to hear about the re awarding of the medals
3053167 with lieberman in addition to cantor t seems to me that the mccain camp is thinking of picking a jewish running mate so as to make florida a sure thing by playing on the muslim smear the hamas endorsement and fears about iran combined with a jewish running mate it might make florida nearly impossible for obama to win that said i dont really see what lieberman would add other than a shameless attack dog considering that hes unpopular in the northeast and has extremely low approval ratings amongst jews posted by whitey august 10 2008 2 44 pm
3053168 sometimes in the day to day tracking of a presidential race its hard to separate statistical noise from larger trends a review of week by week results from the rasmussen reports presidential tracking poll shows that the race between obama and mccain has been remarkably stable but it is a bit closer now than in the days shortly after hillary clinton dropped out of the race
3053169 mccain is now trusted more than obama on nine out of 14 electoral issues tracked by rasmussen reports but perhaps the most interesting finding of this survey is that mccain has expanded his leads on nearly every issue he had previously had the advantage on while obamas leads have diminished over the past two weeks
3053170 the american public wants to move on from this thats why obama emerged and thats why mccain emerged both had actually bucked some of the extremes in their own parties
3053171 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3053172 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds

3053181 calorie restriction is linked with growth retardation and birth defects and with vitamin deficiencies both for the mother and baby whats interesting about vitamin deficiencies is say for instance with calcium deficiency the baby will probably get what he or she needs but thatll be at the expense of the mothers bones so you really have to be careful with that
3053182 from the mothers mental and physical health to better deliveries better postpartum recoveries even a higher i q for the baby

3053184 you shouldnt exercise to the point of exhaustion if you need to throw yourself on the couch afterwards just to rejuvenate youve done too much you should feel invigorated after your workout not exhausted
3053185 i think weve never before been more kind of obsessed with celebrity culture and with celebrity pregnancies as well its not unusual to see pictures of these celebrities the day before and the day after birth and theyre looking super humanly fit theyre really incredible

3053199 we have the smallest army in the region and russia has one of the biggest armies in the world so how can you compete
3053200 i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict
3053201 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces
3053202 this is a generalization but usually land on the water is so expensive it is hard to make the numbers work for an rv park plus it is hard to find land on the water that doesnt have a deed or neighborhood restriction against commercial use like an rv park that said there is plenty of land that is close to the lake that you could do it on maybe you could have the park then boaters could go put in at a public ramp there are also some parcels here and there that are on or near the water that you might could do homes to rent and also park and rv just depends what you want to do email me if you would like specifics

3053214 what youre having now is legitimate full blown persecution theyre trying to eradicate this movement before it can gain traction and become a popular movement like it has in america
3053215 in the courts it is in danger home schooling is very strange to the german people they have no experience with this kind of education
3053216 the public has a legitimate interest in countering the rise of parallel societies that are based on religion or motivated by different world views and in integrating minorities into the population as a whole
3053217 germany does not want the kind of citizens that home schooling produces theyve seen how the home schooling movement in the u s developed and theyre very keen on that not happening here
3053218 what were trying to do is get a house just across the border so were living in austria where our visa comes from so the government cant control us with home schooling
3053219 we left our home country and came over here and god supplied this house and the environment and just everything and now theyre saying no you cant stay youve got to leave its hard
3053220 their officials are actually encouraged to home school and not put their children into american schools and into foreign schools
3053221 i know of schools right in our area where its not just mixed swimming but mixed showering after the swim class is over and mixed locker rooms and then they leave and go to the next class
3053222 these things in the school the official state school they destroy the children and we teach the children in the things of god and the people in the official school teach the children in other things against god

3053258 the tinker campaigns attempt to argue that only a black candidate could represent a majority black district isnt so different from john mccains invocation of himself as
3053259 yes it is no different from what republicans do whats your point that was one reason for which she needed to be defeated condemned humiliated and ran out of democratic politics forever
3053260 whats really remarkable about nikki tinkers racist campaign is that its not remarkable at all
3053261 a landslide win with 79 percent of the vote to tinkers 19 percent
3053262 that only a black candidate could represent a majority black district
3053263 frankly i thought it was kind of embarrassing when billy dee was shilling for malt liquor and

3053275 people who are on the right side of the aisle are mocked for believing in fairy tales of the bible but when obama clinton gore carter and mlk talk about faith they are exempt from the scorn
3053276 the type of liberal i have a lot of disdain for is the kind who states that we should be openminded towards muslims who wish ill upon us yet the same liberal practices closemindedness to the evangelical next door
3053277 your average republican thinks hes an economic genius because he got told to like something he thinks of as capitalism at some point
3053278 unfortunately that mocking comes most painfully from the gop not the liberals it was guys like grover norquist and abramoff that considered the religious right to be a bunch of fools to be exploited and the rhetoric about attitudes toward the midwest came from rush limbaugh trying to wedge long time midwest democratic voters toward bush sure you find some liberals applying those labels on blogs and whatnot but the arrogant preaching is generally nonexistent except from what guys like rush fabricate for the audience posted by martin august 8 2008 4 17 pm
3053279 dearleader nyc the type of liberal i have a lot of disdain for is the kind who states that we should be openminded towards muslims who wish ill upon us yet the same liberal practices closemindedness to the evangelical next door nicholas kristoff hardly a right winger wrote a great piece on the hypocracy of some on the left who ran out an bought the koran after 9 11 in order to get a greater understanding of those who murdered 3000 people yet some of the same people who asked for understanding of islam have never bothered to ask for an openminded view of christians in america many of whom practice a religion far less extreme than those who we were asked to show tolerance towards the other thing that bothers me is that a lot of these elitists love to mock the white churchgoer yet would never direct their distaste toward the african american churchgoer people who are on the right side of the aisle are mocked for believing in fairy tales of the bible but when obama clinton gore carter and mlk talk about faith they are exempt from the scorn i hope none of this comes off as a defense of the religious right because i dont have a hell of a lot in common with them posted by dougefresh august 8 2008 11 59 pm

3053284 i believe in gold and nothing is less than that

3053320 saudi arabia is a customer with which we have a long and valued relationship and like all valued customers we will continue to support its requirements as and when they arise

3053336 our concern is that municipal decision making must be based on facts and scientific evidence
3053337 and we were seeing some municipalities that were focusing on the health impacts of idling based on information that was incorrect and misleading
3053338 what i would like to see is that natural resources canada put the same amount of emphasis on these other driving behaviours that they do on idling
3053339 its gonna make it harder for every city politician to make the argument that we need to have restrictive legislation on idling its not good news for cities anywhere

3053354 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
3053355 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
3053356 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
3053357 im pretty aware of the fact that anything you do on the internet pretty much should just be considered public
3053358 about what the company intends to do with your data and your information
3053359 that is why congress at this point is wanting to gather a lot more information because no one knows
3053360 that information is incredibly valuable its the new frontier of advertising

3053372 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3053373 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3053374 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3053375 cuz you waste my time and waste my money and youre not too cool and not so funny

3053382 but hes still warming up hes still getting back into the swing of things i know hes got more fire coming so it should be interesting
3053383 its obviously a different ball than anyone ive played with before i played with vinny testaverde and he had a pretty hard ball but its still different its a different spin
3053384 i try to get as close as possible to it so its coming a little bit faster
3053385 it was just like a game out there the way he just pumped it and threw it right in the hole before the safety could get over there heck of a throw
3053386 obviously he can make any and everything so anything is possible
3053387 whatever they can draw up in the sand he can do it it makes it more challenging for the defense and makes it more fun for us on offense its more fun to get out there and run your routes when you know youre a viable option on every play
3053388 i left the hospital today just after 12 noon memphis time
3053389 i just really i thank the staff at elvis presley hospital and many many thanks to my many well wishers its great to know people care about you

3053395 tuvimos alg n problema que tambi n nos sirve de experiencia pero en general estuvimos bastante bien jugamos ante tres rivales buenos y vinimos bastante mejor de lo que fuimos el positivismo de la plantilla ha solucionado muchos problemas igual otros jugadores le hubieran buscado defectos
3053396 no es f cil preparar los entrenamientos con tanta gente a ver si poco a poco se van colocando no s c mo est n los temas porque dependen de tres partes pero los jugadores lo saben se est n moviendo y estamos esperando que se concrete
3053397 me gusta pensar en el club pero tambi n las personas en m xico hay un nuevo seleccionador sven goran eriksson y aunque es una pena que no est n en el teresa herrera en dos a os hay un mundial y querr n estar los dos van a estar para la uefa que es lo importante
3053398 los buenos jugadores van a estar en el campo si entramos en la uefa vamos a tener muchos partidos y que uno se quede en el banquillo en el primer partido no quiere decir que sea suplente al final es cuando se tienen que hacer valoraciones y espero que entonces haya partidos para la mayor a de los jugadores
3053399 por el bien de todos lafita se tiene que quedar y se va a quedar estoy convencido de que el zaragoza a estas alturas no nos puede hacer una faena as si el zaragoza lo hubiese querido lo habr a adquirido cuando el deportivo ejerci la opci n de compra

3053403 there could be developers sitting on the fence wondering how effective the apple store would be at reaching consumers

3053405 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that

3053418 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength

3053420 fisticuffs with a foreman force him to find farm work
3053421 other countries and old rivals like australia now look to us as a country that got serious about sport and are now saying they are in danger of falling behind great britain in the medal table gordon browns decision in 2006 to give more money to elite sport as we get ready for 2012 has made this possible

3053424 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3053425 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3053426 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
3053427 bernie fell into that category of people who were inherently different like when you saw them you knew they were different and when they spoke you knew they were different as comics were all brothers and ill miss him a lot he was a good friend of mine
3053428 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy

3053433 little caesars created the love kitchen to provide quality meals for people who need them and were committed to helping people in need here at home
3053434 giving back has been part of the way little caesars does business since shortly after the first store opened in 1959 we believe it is important to do our part to help the community and families in need in the detroit area
3053435 what happened to me my family and my close associates is the result of a desire to get rid of me politically
3053436 i have also constantly received news that my life is not safe wherever i travel i have to use bulletproof cars this is the result i got from having volunteered to serve the country the king and the people
3053437 interference in the judicial process and the obvious use of a double standard
3053438 such remarks by the former leader could damage the countrys image in its suggestion that we have an unjust judicial system
3053439 thailand remains a good country with a great amount of justice
3053440 he is certainly going to use his foreign base to influence thailands domestic politics
3053441 there may be a serious conflict in the long run that results in extreme violence if some decide they cannot rely on the judiciary for justice
3053442 still has influence over this government and is pulling the strings

3053457 wir sehen durchaus das problem der gewalt im bermudadreieck es ist uns nicht egal dass sich dort menschen pr geln und es in manchen stadtteilen an bestimmten orten probleme mit obdachlosen gibt
3053458 das sind allerdings soziale probleme die nicht mit diesen verordnungen gel st werden k nnen
3053459 es gibt ein problematisches verhalten vieler leute im umgang mit drogen und alkohol aber dieses problem wird in der diskussion wahllos mit dem gewaltproblem in der innenstadt vermischt das war in der gemeinderatsdebatte gut zu beobachten man hat sich da sehr dar ber aufgeregt dass die jugend schlagwort generation flatrate nicht vern nftig mit alkohol umgehen kann nat rlich ist das sehr erschreckend aber um die l sung dieses problems geht es in dem alkoholverbot ja gar nicht
3053460 denn nahezu alle menschen die im bermudadreieck alkohol konsumieren begehen keine gewalttaten
3053461 der mitgebrachte alkohol kann nicht aggressiver machen als der in kneipen und diskotheken getrunkene
3053462 hnliche verordnungen wie in ravensburg und heilbronn hatten vor gericht keinen bestand

3053476 that doesnt count for crap when it comes to running a business if the work isnt getting done the way the owner or manager wants it to be done you figure out why then you correct it typically that means firing those who arent getting it done right
3053477 that was over six months ago it doesnt count for anything now
3053478 and tonight you saved three lives that has to count for something
3053479 not when youve missed four deadlines and pissed off the senior editor
3053480 so what are you going to do if you do get fired

3053502 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3053503 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3053504 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3053505 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3053506 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3053507 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3053508 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

3053539 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked came against me to eat up my flesh my enemies and foes they stumbled and fell though an army may encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war may rise against me in this i will be confident
3053540 my grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness

3053544 we had a good mix of educators public officials and small business people who support our national guard and reserve troops
3053545 we wanted to give them an idea of what leapfest which is hosted by the rhode island guard is all about
3053546 i got interested in esgr because first lieutenant kate auxier in the army national guard used to work for me
3053547 i wanted to see this because we teach national guard and reserve officers at the naval war college in newport
3053548 we have always had a good relationship with the national guard and reserve
3053549 vargo introduces the reader to tangible characters in the presence of ancient and impure evil a must read preferably during the day in a well lit room
3053550 vargo is a writer whos not afraid to take chances a writer who understands how to craft characters with whom a reader can relate a writer to watch very very carefully
3053551 vargo is a voice with a certain place in the future of horror
3053552 vargo writes some of the most vividly detailed scenes ive read in years the characters are as real as anyone youll meet on the street and a few youll hope you never meet fans of dark fantasy and suspense should rejoice and welcome vargo with open arms
3053553 temos de repensar toda esta estrat gia ol mpica se vale a pena uma grande delega o ou se devemos apostar em for a apenas nos atletas que podem trazer medalhas
3053554 and we have continued to climb and become more successful
3053555 now instead of being the hunters we are now becoming the hunted
3053556 being ranked in the preseason is a credit to last years team accomplishments and this seasons expectations
3053557 however preseason polls dont mean much because its the final poll that counts the most
3053558 the fact that we were able to win so many close games allowed us to gain confidence which transpired into several firsts for the program the effects of last seasons successes have been tremendous as far as respectability with recruits across the country as well as this seasons television schedule and increased ticket sales
3053559 every program goes through a natural maturation and we have continued to climb and become more successful now instead of being the hunters we are now becoming the hunted
3053560 every team at the beginning of the season sets high goals
3053561 we are like every other team we want to win every game
3053562 we are excited to have an opportunity to potentially get back to the ncaa tournament and stay a little longer we now have the confidence and experience to compete for a big 12 title this season
3053563 cj has had a phenomenal career so far and continues to progress every day
3053564 he really improved his assist to turnover ratio last year and hopefully he can take it to 3 to 1 this season curtis is working on the defensive end and his offensive output speaks for itself
3053565 henry made his biggest strides last year on the defensive end
3053566 he was disruptive in the passing lines and he should become a factor on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball he is an explosive scorer and is capable of scoring in bunches
3053567 last year tweety really improved his shooting percentages and finished second in assists
3053568 there is no reason why he cant continue to improve in all areas of his game he is one of the best on ball defenders in the league and a tremendous scorer
3053569 lace is coming off an excellence freshman season that garnered him freshman all american honors
3053570 i look for him to continue improving defensively as well as his assist to turnover ratio as he continues to mature in all facets of the game he can score with the best in the nation
3053571 kendall has a ton of athleticism and can really score
3053572 he will be able to help the team in numerous ways once he joins us
3053573 our 3 point weapon is the main focal point of our offense
3053574 without it we struggle that is why we continue to improve in other areas including defense and offensive production in the paint shooting the 3 really opens up the offense and makes us go
3053575 he went to the basket strong every time took fouls and got to the free throw line its a huge advantage anytime you can average 8 5 rebounds a game and be a double double guy like kevin he should improve his all around game and become a vocal leader for us this season
3053576 mamadou was healthy this summer and rehabbed for six weeks following ankle surgery at the end of the season
3053577 he had a chance to strengthen and rejuvenate his ankles we look for him to have a great senior season so long as he can stay injury free
3053578 delbert had some really good moments in his first season
3053579 we need him to be more consistent with those good moments he helped us win big games at south carolina and missouri he had a good summer and should take another step forward in his senior season
3053580 josh had a chance to become bigger faster stronger and more athletic this summer
3053581 he should to continue to progress on the court as long as he stays healthy
3053582 he provides us with a player inside and out while giving us added length on the perimeter and quickness on the interior
3053583 weve added two highly recruited players in anthony jones and quincy acy
3053584 they will both help us tremendously this season quincy could make an immediate impact on the court
3053585 anthony has great length and will be a complete mismatch player
3053586 he can hurt the opponent both inside and out like all freshmen he will have to adjust to the physicality of the big 12 he has a very bright future at baylor he can shoot the 3 handle the ball and block shots he will help alter and contest shots and give us an added shot blocker
3053587 to have 15 of our 16 big 12 games televised at the regional and national level is a testament to how hard our team has worked and how far this program has come
3053588 now our alumni and fans that arent able to come to all our games have the opportunity to watch us perform on a national stage
3053589 we are excited to play so many games on the espn network including our two big monday games with kansas and texas it is going to be an exciting season
3053590 the u s embassy baghdad and the multinational force iraq strongly condemn the terrorist car bombing that occurred on friday in the moalameen market in tal afar
3053591 the targets of these vicious and cowardly attacks were innocent iraqi men women and children
3053592 we will work closely with the people and government of iraq to confront those who carry out these barbaric acts
3053593 we know that such senseless attacks will further unite the iraqi people in their rejection of al qaida and the indiscriminate violence they inflict upon the citizens of iraq
3053594 negotiating under fire preserving peace talks in the face of terror attacks
3053595 hamas politics charity and terrorism in the service of jihad
3053596 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
3053597 but it also will have some costs associated with it too
3053598 quite frankly for that country and for the conditions that exist there more afghan forces are needed to be able to defeat the terrorists and to defend the afghan people
3053599 we are looking at options and ways that we can streamline the command and control arrangements for u s forces in afghanistan
3053600 this is not a finished action this is not a done deal by any means
3053601 although it would be one commander in charge of both missions the missions would not be blended in any way
3053602 so youd have the isaf mission and youd have the oef mission and theyd remain separate and distinct
3053603 so youve got u s forces that are not all under the command of a single u s officer in afghanistan
3053604 if i got a problem yo ill solve it check out the beat while my dj revolves it

3053666 colombia es un pa s peque o deportivamente a nivel mundial estamos distantes de las potencias esta es una medalla que necesitaba el pueblo colombiano
3053667 centro mi objetivo en estar en las alturas de la clasificaci n durante mucho tiempo en la parte superior no significa el n mero uno del mundo es prioritario pujar por los t tulos del grand slam y estar en la parte alta compatibilizar todo con el n mero uno s que es dif cil
3053668 siempre supe que uno no puede mantener siempre el n mero uno si uno pierde su posici n la intenci n siguiente es regresar ah eso est claro
3053669 por eso est claro que mi objetivo es regresar al n mero uno del mundo y para eso tengo que volver a jugar bien tengo que ganar los grandes partidos que cada torneo cuente para m pero no es un secreto que el calendario es complicado y que yo lo centro en el grand slam porque es aqu donde realmente enfoco mis principales metas aqu es donde quiero trabajar y hacer lo mejor
3053670 este a o ha sido dif cil para todo el mundo porque hemos sido obligados a disputar de alguna manera ciertos torneos no es una cr tica pero es un hecho
3053671 con los juegos ol mpicos toda la preparaci n ha cambiado se hizo realmente dif cil tener la preparaci n debida es por eso uno de los motivos por el que algunos jugadores juegan mejor y otros peor aqu por eso tambi n pienso que el a o que viene regresar la normalidad y podremos controlar mejor nuestros compromisos ser clave para la temporada
3053672 hace una humedad terrible comparada con otros lugares en los que jugamos no hay muchos sitios que tengan esta situaci n yo recuerdo que uno de los partidos contra guillermo ca as en canad hace cinco o seis a os padec una humedad insoportable por eso decid ir a entrenar a dubai donde hay 45 grados y mucha humedad eso me vino bien para situaciones como estas
3053673 me asombra leo a rom n y al kun ya les conoc a pero leo es la primera vez que lo veo tan de cerca y lo que hace es impresionante nunca hab a visto un nivel como el de messi desde tan cerca

3053680 shola will be back in full training this week after his hamstring injury
3053681 it is not as bad as we thought when he came off in the first game in majorca
3053682 he has started light training and will be back this week
3053683 i cannot imagine that there is an agreement between flamengo and marcelinho
3053684 i have spoken to marcelinho and he has made it clear
3053685 there is no concrete offer as yet but it could be that i need to get someone in the week
3053686 fue una pelea fuerte estaba tenso porque el primer combate siempre es dif cil pero ganar es muy importante porque eso le da soltura y confianza no solo a mi sino al equipo que va por medalla
3053687 esto es lo m s hermoso que me ha pasado ganar en mi primer combate en juegos ol mpicos me siento tan feliz
3053688 i feel the end approaching quick bring me my dessert
3053689 for me the cooking life has been a long love affair with moments both sublime and ridiculous
3053690 i danced one night in a place there was a club and they asked for a guy to kind of make a striptease and i did it it was for ten minutes i needed money my mother was there in the audience she was so proud
3053691 un buen partido para ser el primero no puedo pedir m s
3053692 jugar con federer que es todav a el n mero uno del mundo es un premio un honor y yo voy a tratar de dar el 100
3053693 tuve que cambiar de camiseta cada 10 minutos as es dif cil todo el tiempo ten a que ponerme un producto en las manos tratar de cambiar de toalla eso es m s trabajo
3053694 hay que ir paso a paso el partido que sigue es muy duro estamos hablando de jugadores que est n dentro de los 10 mejores del mundo y tal como uno puede ganar puede perder tambi n pero me siento capacitado para jugar de igual a igual con cualquier jugador y eso es lo importante
3053695 en argentina se espera mucho de m como jugador siento esa presi n desde que empec a jugar si logro mantener este nivel durante el futuro cercano llegar a ser un buen tenista m s adelante
3053696 all es todo muy humilde desde chico me entren siempre en el mismo club en las mismas canchas con pelotas usadas y esas cosas te hacen trabajar con m s ganas con m s sacrificio
3053697 cuando uno nota el cambio a profesional y ya tiene canchas buenas pelotas buenas y jugadores de primer nivel para entrenar es algo muy lindo porque uno se pone a pensar en todo el pasado y las cosas que vivi y ahora tener la posibilidad de que esas cosas sean diferentes es algo incre ble

3053703 immediate economic and humanitarian assistance to help mitigate the impact the invasion has had on the people of georgia
3053704 in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3053705 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the us and europe
3053706 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3053707 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3053708 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3053709 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3053710 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3053711 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3053712 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3053713 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3053714 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3053715 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3053716 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3053717 the countrys still pretty divided people may want a divided government they want change but im not sure that the democratic agenda has the support of a majority of americans
3053718 trasnochados desilusionados y eliminados as estamos los hondure os tras perder con camer n en los juegos ol mpicos

3053723 el hecho de que haya mantenido la puerta a cero prueba que este brasil es bueno en ataque pero tambi n en defensa
3053724 es muy importante no recibir goles en una competici n tan corta
3053725 no se crearon para ser celebrados s lo en los pa ses ricos
3053726 con cada jefe de estado que reciba en brasil en cada viaje al exterior que haga este asunto estar en la pauta para intentar convencer a las personas
3053727 convencido de que brasil precisa pelear mucho para conquistar el derecho de hacer los juegos en el 2016
3053728 los juegos ol mpicos no fueron creados para ser celebrados s lo en los pa ses ricos

3053732 no se gana descalificando a la otra sino porque objetivamente es la mejor
3053733 sabemos que conseguir unos juegos no es descalificando al adversario lo vamos a conseguir no porque lo hagan mal los dem s que no lo van a hacer ni porque argumentemos elementos negativos sino porque objetivamente es la mejor
3053734 para mi fue buena pelea consegu la victoria y ahora hay que echarle ganas para la siguiente
3053735 no conozco nada de mi pr ximo rival simplemente saldr a pelear y hacer mejor las cosas
3053736 como hice hoy trabajar a mi rival y veremos a ver que es lo que pasa
3053737 estoy contento por haber logrado un triunfo en los juegos ol mpicos
3053738 conseguimos los triunfos y demostramos que queremos lo mejor para el deporte
3053739 el rival de pasado ma ana serbia es dif cil est t cnicamente bien dotado y hay que respetarlo en todos los sentidos porque adem s si ganan pueden clasificarse as que podr an ser muy peligrosos
3053740 conversamos con la direcci n y optamos por darle un espacio a los j venes para ver si conseguimos revelar a alguien ser la oportunidad que muchos atletas est n esperando

3053835 one of the most common behavioral changes cancer survivors make sometimes without a doctors advice often on their own is using dietary supplements in hopes of bolstering their health
3053836 still its unclear whether supplements really help keep cancer survivors healthier or put them at further risk they like many other people today use the internet and you can find a lot of false hope out there with supplements targeted at cancer survivors
3053837 in our study we see people taking supplements who have good diets and who are relatively healthy
3053838 while they may need a particular vitamin because they dont get enough of it they may not need a multivitamin or supplement because of the increased risk of cancer recurrence or a secondary cancer
3053839 its controversial but more research is pointing to not recommending supplements for cancer survivors because of the associated risk of the diseases return
3053840 with the number of older cancer survivors growing rapidly the better we understand the use of supplements the more valuable the insight we gain in our effort to improve health outcomes in cancer survivors

3054030 do the articles in the montgomery county bulletin amount to the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of american journalism perhaps the bulletin is merely on trend or even ahead of its time the drudge report the huffington post and real clear politics have made names and money by sifting through rss feeds the bulletin may simply be bringing guerilla style 21st century content aggregation to 20th century print media publishing the napster of newspapers

3054034 the frustration to me is that some in the system are trying to blame us for doing our job and equally as frustrating is what it means for the victim and her family to have to go back on the stand especially in rape trials it must be terribly difficult

3054040 the long standing expectation that a healthy magazine is one that sees successive growth on the newsstand is in question whether the change is cyclical uncertain economic times that include high gas prices fewer supermarket trips and less disposable income or secular consumer behavior is undergoing a fundamental change away from newsstand or from print magazines themselves depends on whom you ask editors and publishers would have it be the former

3054046 the united states will soon have a new president and commander in chief but the complex issues the united states faces will remain this strategy is a blueprint to succeed in the years to come
3054047 for our friends and allies as well as for our enemies and potential adversaries our commitment to democratic values must be matched by our deeds the spread of liberty both manifests our ideals and protects our interests
3054048 we must balance strategic risk across our responses making the best use of the tools at hand within the u s government and among our international partners to succeed we must harness and integrate all aspects of national power and work closely with a wide range of allies friends and partners we cannot prevail if we act alone
3054049 the inability of many states to police themselves effectively or to work with their neighbors to ensure regional security represents a challenge to the international system armed sub national groups including but not limited to those inspired by violent extremism threaten the stability and legitimacy of key states if left unchecked such instability can spread and threaten regions of interest to the united states our allies and friends insurgent groups and other non state actors frequently exploit local geographical political or social conditions to establish safe havens from which they can operate with impunity ungoverned undergoverned misgoverned and contested areas offer fertile ground for such groups to exploit the gaps in governance capacity of local regimes to undermine local stability and regional security
3054050 addressing this problem will require local partnerships and creative approaches to deny extremists the opportunity to gain footholds
3054051 it is likely that china will continue to expand its conventional military capabilities emphasizing anti access and area denial assets including developing a full range of long range strike space and information warfare capabilities
3054052 the security of the united states is tightly bound up with the security of the broader international system our strategy seeks to build the capacity of fragile or vulnerable partners to withstand internal threats and external aggression while improving the capacity of the international system itself to withstand the challenge posed by rogue states and would be hegemons
3054053 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
3054054 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory we face a clash of arms a war of ideas and an assistance effort that will require patience and innovation in concert with our partners we must maintain a long term commitment to undermining and reducing the sources of support for extremist groups and to countering the ideological totalitarian messages they build upon
3054055 this conflict is a prolonged irregular campaign a violent struggle for legitimacy and influence over the population the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies for these reasons arguably the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves
3054056 countering the totalitarian ideological message of terrorist groups to help further undermine their potency will also require sensitive sophisticated and integrated interagency and international efforts the department will support and facilitate these efforts
3054057 we will defeat them through the patient accumulation of quiet successes and the orchestration of all elements of national and international power
3054058 shaping the choices of key states preventing adversaries from acquiring or using wmd strengthening and expanding alliances and partnerships securing u s strategic access and retaining freedom of action and integrating and unifying our efforts
3054059 iraq and afghanistan remind us that military success alone is insufficient to achieve victory we must not forget our hard learned lessons or allow the important soft power capabilities developed because of them to atrophy or even disappear
3054060 the united states must improve its ability to deploy civilian expertise rapidly and continue to increase effectiveness by joining with organizations and people outside of government untapped resources with enormous potential we can make better use of the expertise of our universities and of industry to assist in reconstruction and long term improvements to economic vitality and good governance greater civilian participation is necessary both to make military operations successful and to relieve stress on the men and women of the armed forces having permanent civilian capabilities available and using them early could also make it less likely that military forces will need to be deployed in the first place
3054061 mobile phones are without question the most underutilized computing platform in the world
3054062 despite the fact that billions of phones are able to run applications industry research shows that less than 5 percent of mobile subscribers around the world are actually running third party applications on their phones cascada mobile believes there are two main reasons why this number is so low first that conditions for mobile application development are a huge challenge limiting the number of mobile developers and applications and second that there are few resources for finding applications that are of interest to subscribers the breeze platform and breeze apps portal solve both halves of this mobile application problem

3054078 any religious person the point is to question what is usually made to be unquestionable in this country normally if you say the word faith the debate is over no matter what incredibly nonsensical destructive ridiculous tenet comes out of your mouth i could say my faith is the tooth fairy and klingons are coming but im not going to play by those rules

3054137 the dollars multi year bear market is over and given the trending nature of the currency market a new bull market has begun
3054138 the recent decline in commodity prices has resulted in a capital flight out of numerous asset classes whose fate was linked to commodity prices and into dollar based assets
3054139 this is a very subtle difference but it is significant
3054140 persons with emerging als may also have similarly subtle symptoms
3054141 we can only guess why this pattern is less common in the mutants
3054142 such therapies could very well be effective against the non genetic version of the disease as well

3054144 you need a lot of bacteria working together to make some tasks successful

3054153 but as an athlete especially at a place like michigan they teach you how to get 100 percent out of yourself in every race and thats what i was trying to do today in spite of what happened i just tried to represent my country and my team back in michigan the best way i could
3054154 as for now im trying to act as professionally as i can
3054155 i gave it my best shot and im glad i gave 100 percent today not 80 percent not 90 i gave it 100 percent

3054157 these savings represent a six fold return on the states investment and will continue to accrue each year
3054158 this should be a call to action for all health plans and employers to help workers quit tobacco its clear that physical health and fiscal health go hand in hand
3054159 health insurance costs are directly related to the health and wellness of our citizenry
3054160 for the benefit of our citizens and state all health plans and employers would certainly do well to follow oseegibs lead
3054161 this simply makes good business sense its much less expensive to prevent heart disease cancer stroke and chronic lung disease than to pay for all the medical care to treat these diseases

3054164 we wanted to ask the question in the global sense what is the genetic dictionary of the west nile virus
3054165 for the most part the rna screens in the past have been done with fruit flies
3054166 we wanted to go as close to human cells as possible
3054167 about 40 or 50 of the 300 were common between the two experiments we hope there are others in common with several if not the majority of flaviviruses
3054168 but what you get in a hela cell in vitro might be very different from what you find in vivo were cautiously optimistic
3054169 the russian side did not receive any official proposals from the georgian side to begin a peace process and to stop the bloodshed
3054170 in the short term this will become the standard method of mapping genes in c elegans
3054171 and over the longer term as the sequencing capacity of the technology increases whole genome sequencing will become the method of choice for higher organisms including fruitflies mice and humans
3054172 in reality however people have a hard time fully and exhaustively harvesting the fruits of many genetic screens because it takes so much time to map and identify the molecular lesions in isolated mutants
3054173 moreover with deep sequencing technology one can now focus gene characterization not just based on whether a gene has an interesting phenotype but also based on whether the molecular identity of the gene is of interest
3054174 for example in the past if you came up with fifty worm mutants that were unable to crawl you had to more or less randomly pick which mutant to pursue but with whole genome deep sequencing at least in principle you could sequence all fifty mutants and ask which genes look the most interesting in terms of the molecular identity for example because it has a human homolog and further characterize those as importantly deep sequencing also allows you to identify the molecular identity of mutants that would have been otherwise very hard to map by conventional methods such as behavioral mutants or modifier mutants this whole technology is a true blessing for classic genetic analysis
3054175 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
3054176 now we have a way to do just that to derive pluripotent cells from patients with disease which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques

3054181 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
3054182 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
3054183 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
3054184 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
3054185 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
3054186 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
3054187 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town

3054248 in africa we can grow sweet sorghum twice a year but here in america you can grow it just once
3054249 its a big benefit we have in africa to get two yields
3054250 here in southeast missouri we may plant corn at the end of march or early april
3054251 with sweet sorghum we usually have to wait until early may to plant
3054252 if we can take genes from the cold tolerant variety and put them into a variety that produces more sugar well get the best of both worlds
3054253 if we can harvest earlier it will grow back again and we could get two harvests instead of one
3054254 sweet sorghum can be grown in areas where corn doesnt grow very well right now
3054255 its another crop option thats versatile and will keep performing in situations where corn wont
3054256 it removes almost the same amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while growing that is emitted during ethanol production
3054257 were working with bayer and hornbeck seed looking at three different varieties the libertylink line hbk4924 and pioneer 94m80
3054258 were trying to stick with the same maturity groups 4 8 4 9 studies have been planted in keiser weiner dewitt clarkedale cleveland and hollandale miss so were getting a big geographical area with different planting dates and soil types
3054259 proline is another bayer fungicide a triazole that can be used for asian soybean rust and other things
3054260 were looking at treatments by themselves and in combinations to see how these varieties respond to bayers portfolio of soybean products in that were obviously looking at seed treatments and ignite on libertylink beans as well as their products on roundup ready beans
3054261 we know there is some plant health or plant response of soybeans to fungicides weve seen this over the years with different germplasms and varieties and achieving 3 bushel to 10 bushel increases with little or no disease pressure at all
3054262 there is a lot of rice and that means there are a lot of irrigated soybeans we can push the beans with a good fertility program
3054263 one application of stratego would cost about the same as a 1 bushel yield increase theres a lot of interest from farmers saying im going to blanket my farm at r 3 r 4 those are the critical growth stages that have been determined to be when fungicides have the greatest impact
3054264 something thats impacted those of us around stuttgart is whether this can impact seed quality
3054265 can it impact the accelerated aging parameter of seed quality and germination
3054266 each time there have been issues with accelerated aging aa a 95 percent germ and 45 percent aa he went to replant and ran out of beans there was a 4 8 here and 5 2 over there and now theyre replanting again its a mess
3054267 were doing two projects this year one is the work with helms on plant health yield tests with all these fungicide applications
3054268 i want to clear up one thing about what fungicides do
3054269 what were really saying is i want that plant to prematurely die i want to cut it off about two weeks before its fully mature well if you want to make more yield keep it alive let its normal physiological maturity play out and youll have higher yields
3054270 thats what a fungicide does it protects the plant so it can grow its normal lifecycle
3054271 amazing the roundup ready varieties are also a good height so maybe its just a good year for growth
3054272 were treating the roundup ready beans with roundup and the libertylink beans with ignite that will allow us to see if theres any reaction between the herbicide used on a particular herbicide trait variety versus the conventional chemicals used in the regular yield trials is there a benefit from using ignite on the libertylink beans or do they yield the same regardless
3054273 we began making crosses with the libertylink trait bringing it into hornbecks germplasm weve maintained a fairly large conventional program while other companies were letting it go so we automatically had a lot of high yielding lines we could move a new trait into
3054274 for about two cycles theyre back in the field this year and in the fall well pull single plants we could have 50 000 to 100 000 new varieties at the end of the season
3054275 weve still got to yield test them and throw about 95 percent away each time until were satisfied those left have the yield potential to be competitive in the market
3054276 we hope by our materials launch well be ready to cover all those maturity groups
3054277 off and on weve worked with ignite for around nine years i wish wed have had it all those years wed have clean farms
3054278 now there are three weed species that roundup does a lousy job controlling weve had to go back to conventional herbicides to maintain usually a plane flies on reflex right before harvest because of canopied morningglories but ignite fries that stuff
3054279 another choice something that can control weeds that roundup is having problems with
3054280 we put out our first ignite application wrong we were a little worried about drift and we lowered the boom and the product didnt go through the plants and get the other side one side of the row was deader than a hammer and the other side was green its a contact herbicide so youve got to apply it to what you want to kill
3054281 cotton is going to need to have a price rally if were going to hold on to acres in 2009 or weve got to come off these high corn and soybean prices
3054282 yesterday july 23 the december 09 cotton contract was at 85 40 cents corn was at 6 13 soybeans at 13 56
3054283 if that price situation continues and we keep seeing increases in input costs until time for planting decisions to be made next spring we probably could see growers moving a few more acres out of cotton which would put even more pressure on the infrastructure
3054284 with crude oil prices moving between 125 and 145 per barrel energy costs are a major factor for everyone were expecting these costs to remain at about current levels through 2009
3054285 it looks like about another 10 cents per pound in costs of production just for these variable inputs in the mid south that equates to about 100 per acre just for fertilizer energy and chemical costs all this translates into a significant squeeze on the bottom line
3054286 got a lot of attention but weve since backed off those and now are generally talking about new york futures trading in the low 70 cent range and the a index of international prices trading in the upper 70s for the last several weeks the market has been trading in a sideways pattern
3054287 in the near term one of the things that continues to weigh on the cotton market is the stocks on hand at the end of the current marketing year july 31 usda is estimating a bit over 10 million bales of carryover and with that level of stocks the market apparently feels short term theres enough cotton on hand to meet demand so weve got some stocks to work through before we can talk about the light at the end of the tunnel for cotton prices
3054288 in early july usda was estimating 14 million bales of u
3054289 if things go well between now and harvest 15 plus million bales is still possible or if things take a turn for the worse over the growing season 12 million bales is possible in the mid south were probably looking at a crop of around 4 million bales with the sharp acreage cutbacks in mississippi were probably talking about only 700 000 bales for that state
3054290 in general the u s crop is not as good as a year ago a lot of whats happening in the market is driven by texas which represents 51 percent of u s acreage this year their yield variability and the amount thats abandoned from year to year can be substantial plus or minus 20 percent on yields is not uncommon and harvested acres can change anywhere from 3 percent to 40 percent all that variability throws quite a bit of uncertainty into what the overall u s crop is likely to be
3054291 mill use and exports should exceed that by a fair amount somewhere around 18 million to 19 million bales that will change the ending stocks situation a lot a year from now probably down to 5 million to 6 million bales that has the potential to make the market look a lot different next july 31
3054292 looking at february april harvest time futures prices for cotton corn and soybeans over the past several years in spring 2006 cotton was 58
3054293 for 2009 the december cotton futures price is 85 40 cents corn 6 18 and soybeans 13 56 if these prices hold and input costs keep rising we could see more acres going out of cotton
3054294 in 2007 u s cotton acreage was down 29 1 percent but in the rest of the world only 1 8 percent in 2008 u s acreage was down another 14 6 percent the rest of the world only 0 8 percent
3054295 well learn over the next three or four months what these other countries have done in response to the u s cutbacks we know u s acreage has shifted because of stronger prices for grain and soybean prices relative to cotton we werent seeing a lot of that in other countries until the last few weeks reports coming out of china india turkey and other big producers are indicating reduced acreage and thats another development that has a chance to get the attention of the market once we learn more about what theyve actually done
3054296 if grain and oilseed prices stay strong and strength continues in the vegetable oils markets wed have to think cottonseed prices will continue strong
3054297 its clear the world crop is not going to be as large as world consumption of cotton
3054298 were going to chew through some stocks hopefully we can continue to keep demand strong the economy is always going to be a concern as are higher energy costs and more competition for the consumers dollar
3054299 were in a situation where the fundamentals are different for cotton and grains cotton stocks arent tight grain stocks are the situation could be different 12 18 months from now but were going to have to work through some stocks going forward
3054300 are now at something of a make or break point in terms of trying to achieve some kind of closure
3054301 we will qualify for the world cup we will be in south africa i am sure of it

3054391 russian peacekeepers and support units are carrying out an operation aimed at preventing the shelling of peacekeeping forces by georgian artillery and aimed at preventing georgian forces from regrouping to carry new attacks on south ossetia
3054392 senaki is one of the places where such actions were under way
3054393 they have advanced in dozens of armoured personnel carriers and are now in senaki
3054394 if the ultimatum is rejected all necessary enforcement measures will be used
3054395 we are not going to surrender any arms to the russians

3054404 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3054405 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3054406 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3054407 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3054408 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3054409 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3054410 im pretty aware of the fact that anything you do on the internet pretty much should just be considered public
3054411 about what the company intends to do with your data and your information
3054412 like all privacy matters its something that people need to be informed on
3054413 that is why congress at this point is wanting to gather a lot more information because no one knows
3054414 that information is incredibly valuable its the new frontier of advertising
3054415 we can understand exactly what each sector of the communications industry is technically capable of doing and how they use the information once they do get access to it
3054416 we dont have any raw data on the identifiable individual
3054417 we will not be using this technology again until such time as all the privacy concerns have been addressed
3054418 we are perfectly o k for some of our partners to wait until we have a better more informed education of the public and folks in washington before they resume their rollout
3054419 compliance is becoming very complex and not very clear in terms of what applies to a new and emerging business model
3054420 from the companys perspective of trying to comply with these laws we thought a comprehensive federal privacy law made a lot of sense
3054421 theyre raising these bigger picture questions and those questions are inherently intertwined not just with privacy laws but also with contract law computer intrusion law consumer fraud law
3054422 when legislators are trying to regulate in this area theyre always caught a little bit between a rock and a hard place
3054423 you dont want to adopt a technology specific standard thats destined to fail as technology advances faster than the law can ever hope to embody at the same time you need to allow adequate specificity in the law to allow companies to comply with it and allow consumers to know what their rights are
3054424 theres a self regulatory program out there which hasnt been very effective
3054425 a really welcome development in the absence of any kind of regulation
3054426 the companies dont feel the need to explain everything theyre doing
3054427 so a little bit of pressure from congress or the f t c can go a long way

3054436 acredito que um jogador o cruzeiro poder perder eu acho que depende da proposta que possa vir a ter no momento n o tem ningu m e a expectativa que continue com maior n mero poss vel deste grupo atual
3054437 a janela termina no final de agosto a gente sabe que as coisas v o afunilando mas oficialmente o cruzeiro ainda n o teve nenhuma proposta
3054438 eu acho que se sair um jogador ser muito e eu acho que tecnicamente para a equipe importante que saia o m nimo poss vel eu espero que se tiver de sair que saia apenas um
3054439 podemos rivalizar com todo o mundo n o precisamos esconder podemos ganhar a liga dos campe es
3054440 fico feliz de estar em um grande clube como esse para aproveitar as chances quando elas aparecem
3054441 a minha maior motiva o jogar pelo s o paulo pois sabia quando vim para c que seria reserva j que o rog rio ceni e insubstitu vel para mim n o teria como ser de outra forma
3054442 o meu pensamento de poder ajudar o time e fico muito feliz por estar em um grande clube como o s o paulo com essa estrutura sei que tenho poucas oportunidades mas quando elas aparecem tenho de dar o meu melhor pois a torcida vai cobrar e sei como grande a responsabilidade de substituir o rog rio
3054443 n o sei por que nunca conseguimos no jogo passado ficamos perto da vit ria complicado pois nossos advers rios sempre t m uma motiva o a mais por jogar contra o s o paulo
3054444 temos mais essa chance de quebrar esse tabu como diz o pensamento popular tabus s o feitos para serem quebrados tamb m nas ltimas partida fomos com times reservas enfrentando uma equipe entrosada isso conta muito no futebol
3054445 sab amos das qualidades do time do coritiba e t nhamos feito um acordo no vesti rio para marcar forte acabamos n o fazendo o que o nelsinho pediu e fomos envolvidos pelo time deles
3054446 n o tem erro individual de ningu m quando ganha os m ritos s o de todos e quando perde todos sofrem acho que faltou um pouco de aten o do nosso time inteiro e deixamos a equipe deles tocar a bola com facilidade a qualidade deles e o espa o que demos fizeram com que eles tivesse espa o para trabalhar a bola e marcar os gols
3054447 fui contatado pelo corinthians e recebi uma oferta a proposta j nos foi encaminhada j at passei para o roberto dinamite presidente e vamos analisar temos de ver as alternativas e vamos ver se h uma justificativa para que o neg cio prospere

3054456 se trata de una enfermedad infecciosa de etiolog a no claramente conocida si bien en la actualidad se acepta que es un proceso v rico la enfermedad afecta por el momento exclusivamente al salm n del atl ntico salmo salar el agente etiol gico parece ser un virus de unos 80 nm de tama o y sensible al cloroformo caracter sticas que parecen aproximarlo a los togaviridae es capaz de provocar la s ntesis de anticuerpos circulantes
3054457 desde el punto de vista epidemiol gico se ha observado que la enfermedad s lo se presenta en agua salada nunca cuando el salm n est en agua dulce por otro lado la enfermedad se presenta especialmente en primavera y parece que pudiera existir un componente gen tico asociado a la resistencia de la enfermedad ya que la mayor a de los salmones salvajes son resistentes a la misma
3054458 la enfermedad se transmite de forma horizontal tanto directa como indirecta ya que agente etiol gico parece que es transportado a trav s de reservorios en la materia org nica y en el propio agua ya que en aquellos lugares donde la enfermedad se ha presentado ha resultado muy compleja de eliminar a pesar de las medidas de tipo higi nico sanitario instauradas
3054459 tambi n se plantea la posibilidad de que algunos par sitos del pez puedan actuar como vectores no obstante por el momento son todo hip tesis de trabajo que deben ser demostradas

3054461 se trata de un proceso v rico lo que supone que no existe un tratamiento curativo que sea eficaz debiendo apoyarse la lucha frente a la enfermedad en la instauraci n de medidas de tipo higi nico sanitario que eviten la diseminaci n de la enfermedad las medidas a instaurar son la limpieza y desinfecci n de los estanques aplicando desinfectantes amonios cuaternarios formalina clorados organofosforados iod foros y evitar los factores desencadenantes de stress en los animales manejo adecuado excesiva densidad de poblaci n etc la posible intervenci n de vectores en la transmisi n de la enfermedad exige el control de los mismos

3054469 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3054470 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3054471 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3054472 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3054473 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3054474 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3054475 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3054476 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3054545 mi mayor preocupaci n es que en este proceso que se ha abierto de mejorar el sistema de financiaci n general baleares sea la comunidad aut noma que sea m s beneficiada
3054546 ha dicho antich durante una visita al barrio palmesano de son ferriol donde ha asistido a una demostraci n del funcionamiento de la receta electr nica
3054547 de la apertura de este proceso debe salir una buena soluci n para baleares sin perjuicio de que deber ser un acuerdo multilateral con todas las comunidades
3054548 que se cumplan todos y cada uno de los requisitos
3054549 una voluntad de dar soluci n a los graves problemas que est creando este sistema de financiaci n
3054550 es la m s perjudicada y a bastante distancia de otras comunidades aut nomas
3054551 hasta ahora todas las manifestaciones de los principios que deben inspirar el nuevo sistema de financiaci n y la sensibilidad hacia baleares al reconocer que es la comunidad m s perjudicada tanto desde el ministerio de econom a como del presidente zapatero han sido claras y contundentes

3054565 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3054566 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3054567 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3054568 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3054569 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3054570 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3054571 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3054572 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3054573 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3054574 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3054575 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3054576 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3054577 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3054583 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
3054584 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
3054585 made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
3054586 he has been driven to be outspoken by the appalling prospect of his silence in the wake of worsening chinese repression
3054587 were trying to make it clear that they need to step it up
3054588 if he would go the power of house churches in china would grow
3054589 how can this be called a harmonious society if its harmonious wed have a right to stay in beijing and attend the olympics
3054590 to open religious services and make some literature available to a limited number of people during the olympics is a welcome thing but it means nothing in terms of religious freedom in china
3054591 it would mean more if beijing residents are able to access the bible and other religious literature in a public bookstore and if chinese citizens could choose their places of worship without being afraid of harassment being arrested or sent to labor camps
3054592 i dont care if this is a legal church or an illegal one
3054593 in china there are so many things the government doesnt allow but that doesnt mean that everything banned is bad
3054594 everyone should ask themselves what they truly believe in were all adults we have the ability to decide what we believe in to judge what is right or wrong people wont listen just because the government says so
3054595 in a way its a kind of progress that we are still able to operate
3054596 it shows that the government is worried about its international image
3054597 for some big house churches in cities like beijing and shanghai the government might not push too hard because theyre afraid of a backlash or creating an influential news story
3054598 but for small house churches including many in the countryside the crackdown is very serious
3054599 an important reason for the crackdown is the olympics this year chinese leaders face more pressure from outside groups house churches and even ordinary individual citizens
3054600 the public security bureau always misuses its power they have lost their humanity
3054601 in the olympic village you can find religious freedom maybe some foreigners can worship
3054602 but i tell you the real crisis in china now is that there are no reformers left the power struggle among the leadership is for power not reform to have real political reform they would lose their power
3054603 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3054604 but most of the audience thought it was being shown live so that was mission accomplished
3054605 consistent with a roll over transportation incident where the passengers are unrestrained
3054606 we have not ruled out every known species but we have looked at those species known to live in that area
3054607 there are so many reports of yeti like beasts across south and central asia that i would not be surprised if there are still some pockets of these very very rare and shy creatures
3054608 we would welcome more tourists but we dont want to lie to them in the name of the mande burung
3054609 i believe 100 per cent there is something i will not say it is mande burung because we have not found it but as long as there is no proof we will keep looking
3054610 there are many stories in our myths about elves or whatever but the mande burung is not part of that folklore
3054611 the creature was on the rock he was playing with a stone hitting it against the rock it was black
3054612 it was just a few seconds that i saw it i was very scared
3054613 we are not going to give up until we find it
3054614 im not used to i saw an elk and i thought it might jump at the car are they always that big
3054615 alex last winter you had to shove them out of the driveway with both hands to get the car out
3054616 la sangre recorre el mundo enjaulada insatisfecha las flores se desvanecen devoradas por la hierba ansias de matar invaden el fondo de la azucena
3054617 oh lets get a cart theres something so therapeutic about pushing a cart through target
3054618 the next step is free pizza supported by ads on the box
3054619 ok this guy gets my respect where does his power come from he says its jesus
3054620 then jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of tob and there were gathered vain men to jephthah and went out with him
3054621 if thou shalt without fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon shall surely be the lords and i will offer it up for a burnt offering
3054622 and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said alas my daughter thou hast brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto the lord and i cannot go back

3054651 the brain drain 10 years ago is actually helping the market today
3054652 these are the people going back today bringing domain expertise with them the opportunities in india have dramatically increased for them
3054653 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
3054654 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
3054655 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
3054656 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
3054657 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
3054658 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
3054659 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
3054660 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
3054661 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
3054662 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
3054663 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
3054664 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
3054665 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
3054666 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
3054667 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
3054668 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
3054669 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
3054670 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
3054671 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
3054672 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
3054673 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
3054674 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
3054675 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
3054676 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
3054677 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
3054678 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
3054679 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality
3054680 i think were living in one of the most active periods of web development right now
3054681 we want to celebrate dog owners who go above and beyond the call of duty to present their dogs as breed ambassadors just about any dog can shine if his owner cares enough to commit to a minimal amount of obedience training pit bulls are generally eager beavers when it comes to learning new things so training comes quickly to most
3054682 ive spent many years volunteering with dog rescues and local humane societies in my community during those years i saw first hand many dogs dropped off at my local shelter because these dogs lacked basic good manners and so i realized that a trained dog is more likely to stay in its home bad rap had an opportunity to create a cgc coaching program for pit bulls in our community and i wanted to be a part of it for every pit bull with a cgc certificate i see one more pit bull with a better chance of being a treasured member of the household
3054683 women should not be treated equally with men they should be treated better by an adoring husband husbands should not be usurped and overruled they should be submitted to by a wife who understands that her husband is the one who is answerable to god for the wellbeing of his family
3054684 wow talk about missing the point did you even read the whole entry
3054685 youre stupid and lazy because you dont agree with me
3054686 is the only thing you care about men does the fact that men take advantage of their male privilege to rape and feel entitled to womens bodies not matter to you
3054687 you are a slave to men and you dont care about women in fact you support rape
3054688 i am sick and tired of it i used to think the same way you do and i used to react the same way as you did to posts like mine but you know what i realized after many many years of developing as a feminist that most men rape
3054689 oh these bitches are just bitter and have no justification for their anger
3054690 if you actually read my full entry you would have understood that that rage that anger is very much justified
3054691 go back to my blog and see the links polly styrene has kindly provided for you in the comments section for
3054692 where have i heard that stereotype thrown around about women before
3054693 funny since the only feedback ive been getting from you is bullshit and rudeness
3054694 these past two years have been great working at seton hall for bobby gonzalez ill certainly miss the school but this was an incredible professional opportunity
3054695 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3054696 the conservatorys new mission and strategic direction reaffirms our commitment to skills based arts instruction and helps us better respond to students interests needs and abilities whether you are taking a performing arts class for the first time or have had years of experience the conservatory has a program thats right for you
3054697 i was actually preparing to study historical geology after i completed my art degree
3054698 but that summer i had a job working at a triceratops dig site and one of the university employees saw some of my artwork and encouraged me to apply for an open position within the research division of the university of nebraska natural history museum i didnt expect to get hired but i did and began my career as an illustrator
3054699 so theres not a lot of room for self expression after some time i began painting murals and i was able to have some fun eventually that allowed me to leave my job at the museum and divide my time between murals and fine art with only an occasional illustration job to help pay the bills
3054700 i have been diligent over the years in expanding my knowledge of art through personal study
3054701 i have an extensive library and take every opportunity to visit art museums and traveling exhibitions to study the original works of my favorite artists which include john singer sargent and the northern european still life painters at the time my wife and i were planning to work in asia for a significant period of time so i felt earning a linguistic anthropology degree was the best way to prepare
3054702 i was so impressed with the people i met there i saw the challenges many of them faced to meet basic needs and their endurance made me examine life in a new way
3054703 the expression on her face is indicative of the weight shes carrying
3054704 i like to work with subjects that have strong visual contrast
3054705 my figurative work tends to be more brushy and loose while my still lifes have more detail
3054706 being able to see the relative juxtaposition between warm and cool colors and figuring out how to use them to affect the sense of depth and form in a painting was difficult at first
3054707 i start with classical composition lines and a lot of thumbnail sketches in which i plan out the balance of lights and darks
3054708 this is the most difficult stage but also the most important if i rush this to get to the fun part painting i regret it later
3054709 ive trained myself to stop sooner than i might otherwise and then look at the painting over the course of several days or weeks before making any final adjustments
3054710 there has to be time to learn evolve and experiment i also suggest researching the various techniques used in the media you want to try and then experiment from there i also recommend finding an artist you like and going to a workshop there is nothing like watching another artist pick up a brush and paint most people will discover what they need to discover but theyll progress more quickly if they can learn from others who have gone before them

3054716 we have said that this is a condition driven process
3054717 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
3054718 from a very early age i was fond of drawing and known as a good drawer
3054719 but it wasnt until mica that i took up painting
3054720 karnes was a huge influence on how i thought about painting
3054721 he is quite certain about what painting is for himself and he brings that to the classroom but thats not to say he is inflexible he just has defined parameters namely that painting is most rich when it is done directly from life and is a response to seeing with ones eyes studying under karnes i became sensitized to the beauty and richness of visual experience not only in painting but in my experience of the world in general
3054722 these paintings show my interest in portraiture with the furniture appliances and hardware acting as the sitter
3054723 the aim of portraiture is to represent what is particular and peculiar about the subject and thats what i strive for in my painting i feel that simple straightforward compositions strengthen this sense of portraiture and examination
3054724 wherever i am indoors or outdoors i observe objects and spaces
3054725 i dont search for anything in particular i just remain open to anything that presents itself light plays an important role in much of my work
3054726 i saw it with sunlight on one side creating a kind of half shadow in the front and i sat down then and there and painted it
3054727 i created this piece when i was taking care of a friends plants while she was away the time of day was such that the light brought out this wonderful quality in the couch and seemed to imbue it with character over the next several days of watering her plants i stayed for as long as the light was agreeable and sat on the floor and painted
3054728 i cant imagine what that family is going through im just numb i just did the best i could to focus on my match
3054729 you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition what youll discover will be wonderful what youll discover is yourself
3054730 well what happens to the person that was tailing my ass
3054731 i am very excited to be joining talking retail at this crucial stage in its development retail is a great sector for news and im really looking forward to getting my teeth into it

3054733 was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough

3054735 i married an executive company head all this having been done a turner i own one
3054736 well i stepped into an avalanche it covered up my soul

3054741 i also use calves for technical reasons too difficult to explain
3054742 im not sure if this experiment was very successful either when you use your own back muscles to sync with
3054743 first of all about me what did you do to me
3054744 i tried my best to cure you and god saved you you were in very bad condition its a difficult question what i can tell you i gave you my last model which had benefitted from the last results of my research it will probably last longer number two were going to watch very carefully you have to enjoy life work as you do and have many friends
3054745 we started as surgeon patient now we are best friends
3054746 you know old people like over 80 who dont have insurance should just die i mean they are going to anyway why should our taxes pay for speciality drugs for them i mean if you cant afford it just die quietly
3054747 no i just saw it and thought it was what we were looking for
3054748 the guy at costco what the hell does he know

3054759 the discussion between the two parties were frank and positive they discussed the progress made by iraq and especially that of the iraqi governments success in security and the future reconstruction projects
3054760 hun kan ikke l ngere varetage opdrag elsen og tilsynet med barnet
3054761 for me it was a shameful thing that i wanted to keep hidden
3054762 let me say clearly that matter is not a priority for me but it is something that i will speak to my colleagues about
3054763 the alrc has failed to demonstrate a breach of privacy by the media is not already dealt with by existing laws such as defamation and surveillance laws or self regulation by the media
3054764 both the common law and relevant areas of statute law in particular in the field of defamation strike careful balances between the protection of legitimate interests in privacy and the respect for freedom of speech which has been a hallmark of our legal system
3054765 one of the purposes of evangelicalism is to spread the word so wearing a t shirt or a bracelet that brings jesus messages to other people is actually part of the faith
3054766 all of our products are based on the scriptures on the bible we believe that the core to everything that were doing is the bible
3054767 he wants to see americans move into a domestic self reliance which protects us from a lot of creepy people who hate our guts
3054768 a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset
3054769 its a misnomer to say hes doing this with the countrys best interests at heart because hes obviously got millions of dollars on the line
3054770 he may fine tune it for his self interest but that is kind of the american way
3054771 a lot of people are recognizing the initiative was set up to favor the natural gas industry involved in the transportation sector
3054772 a lot of people have learned that if you want this stuff you dont wait for the federal government to do it
3054773 pickens makes a crusade out of what hes doing because he can make a lot of money
3054774 prop 10 just has all the earmarks of legislation designed to benefit a particular corporation in this case majority owned by pickens
3054775 that is going to undermine his credibility in promoting the national scheme
3054776 what boone would say is capitalism is what this country is based on
3054777 we like to think that you can do good for society and also do well you shouldnt apologize for that
3054778 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together black white hispanic asian native american young old disabled gay straight
3054779 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago
3054780 do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
3054781 oil companies have made not because of their investments not because of their ingenuity and skill but just because of the increase in gas prices
3054782 falls entirely on a windfall then it wont have any economic distortions associated with it
3054783 there were mistakes made in the way this was done in 1980
3054784 brings in fresh ideas to a certain extent the republican party has failed young people when i look at my granddaughter with all the debt we have we need some fresh ideas and new concepts
3054785 i saw him being honest i saw him being sincere
3054786 the average net profit margin for the s amp p energy sector according to figures from thomson baseline is 9 7 the average for the s amp p 500 is 8 5 so yes energy companies are more profitable than many others but not by an inordinate amount
3054787 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
3054788 democratic presidential candidate barack obama opposes offering reparations to the descendants of slaves
3054789 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
3054790 it is realized that the league is incapable of rendering material aid and that the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized countries is unlikely to make any impression upon soviet russia
3054791 while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia
3054792 theres no doubt that the stability and calm has created a good atmosphere that has allowed us to make more summer camps and oversee the youths
3054793 that has nothing to do with the camps the hatred of israel comes from israels occupation which burdens our hearts
3054794 theres no doubt that the stability and calm has created a good atmosphere that has allowed us to make more summer camps and oversee the youths
3054795 that has nothing to do with the camps the hatred of israel comes from israels occupation which burdens our hearts
3054796 it is possible to have a prime minister without a security background the question is what would be wise to do
3054797 despite all the military people that sat around the cabinet table the decisions remained controversial
3054798 a countrys leadership has a responsibility to make decisions this is a test i have passed
3054799 afterward we would have to achieve a truce and we would have to deal with the same parties as before
3054800 even if israeli forces stay there two years and destroy the hamas regime down to the last office and the last activist in the aftermath israel is controlling another people against their will and the palestinian people when they compare the two will choose hamas and not those who talk peace
3054801 everyone knows that when the truce was declared there were already hundreds of grad missiles there
3054802 we must do everything possible and appropriate to bring him home the calm creates the possibility to do so
3054803 former prime minister ariel sharon and his leadership were wise not to respond to hezbollahs strengthening
3054804 david ben gurion said that wars should be avoided or postponed but if they are forced on us we must win them unequivocally on enemy territory and quickly
3054805 without them being held in a place that will allow for talks without reporting daily to the public
3054806 would accept his preconditions before the talks were launched as a condition to their beginning
3054807 those in the middle east who live in the clouds and not on the ground end up with broken limbs and not with peace
3054808 we will tune the undo retention parameter in init file
3054809 in the above command we have not specified any listener name so automatically lsnrctl utility will start

3054811 si no ofrece una raz n v lida carlos tevez podr a terminar jugando al f tbol en el tribunal o en la luna
3054812 its always good to take a break from the madding crowd but especially now that american politics has surpassed itself in self mockery after four days avoiding television blogs youtube and cell phones it is possible to wonder how we get so exercised about the insignificant not that politics isnt important the debate about what role government should play in our lives is no small thing and while we cant all kick back at once and hope that our enemies work out their anger issues a little perspective is salutary and productive in a fallow field kind of way the family is what gives our life meaning and makes our nation strong the family is also what keeps government at a respectful distance working for us and not the other way around all our political choices should be made in the service of that understanding thats all and weve got work to do
3054813 that game i ignored in the preview section of pc gamer
3054814 you might as well get your hose and start spraying the kids but they not getting off your lawn any time soon
3054815 the degree to which commercial entities will go to disrupt a humanitarian project

3054841 put cronyism first and the reading skills of our children last
3054842 we firmly believe we are having greater success with our beginning readers as a result of reading first
3054843 there was no statistically significant impact on reading comprehension scores in grades one two or three

3054905 take it from a yellow trash dad that the white trash mom handbook is a book that you should read actually you dont have to read it just buy it michelle will be just as happy either way as would i be
3054906 michelle totally strips the veneer off the ideal mom and tells you to knock it off already if you are spending time and energy trying to be perfect or even good enough
3054907 some clarification is due here michelle is being ironic when she uses the term white trash as in my house doesnt look like the pages of martha stewarts living i guess were white trash or we were in a hurry so the kids had a drive thru lunch today i guess im white trash if you are looking for decorating tips for your doublewide trailer this book is not for you but if youd like some real advice on juggling motherhood and work navigating the hierarchy of your kids schools or how to deal with the pta you will enjoy michelles book
3054908 buy it for your sister in law who gives you the stink eye every time you give your kid an unthawed eggo buy it for the woman in your mommy and me group who makes you feel like crap for not making your 3 year old go to violin french juggling lessons and send another copy to the bitchy chick down the street the white trash mom handbook is not about money or status or education its about giving yourself the freedom to be yourself and that is a good thing indeed
3054909 every mother out there who doesnt have a full time nanny chef chauffeur agent personal trainer and masseuse should read this book the white trash mom handbook is mommy self help at its finest and funniest

3055057 we are always looking at humanitarian disaster everytime huge numbers of people are driven from their homes
3055058 the assault on mercaz harav seminary and the more recent bulldozer attacks were appalling but israel shouldnt respond by trampling on basic rights
3055059 the house demolition measures would violate international law because they punish people who are not even accused let alone convicted of a crime
3055060 proposals to allow the israel defense forces to resume the collective punishment of house demolitions would mark a substantial step backward in israels respect for human rights
3055061 punishing people for the crimes of others is no solution to terrorism
3055062 israel should focus on bringing to justice those who actually plan or carry out attacks

3055069 buyers entering the hardest hit markets in some cases with multiple bid offers may have put a floor on prices

3055080 jesus designates him peter as the rock on whom the church is to be built gives him the keys of the kingdom of heaven and empowers him to bind and loose terms probably signifying the authority to make binding decisions for the whole community
3055081 in the early chapters of acts we see peter as the unquestioned leader and spokesman of the apostolic leadership acts 1 15 2 25 4 8 5 29 10 24
3055082 in the two letters ascribe to him we see peter from babylon a code name for rome directing his fellow presbyters of other communities
3055083 on the concept of authorship in the new testament era see raymond e
3055084 in principle there can be no objection to designating as pseudonymous 2 peter jas jude and the pastorals col eph and 2 thes
3055085 leaders of the next generation it would seem sometimes exploited the reputation of the founders by attributing to peter paul james and john writings composed after their death turning the founders into literary mouthpieces to give added authority to later works
3055086 when a dispute broke out about the need for christians to observe the mosaic law a consultation was held with the apostles and presbyters at jerusalem who handed down a judgment that they attributed to themselves and the holy spirit acts 15 1 29
3055087 the issue of the historical character of the lucan account in acts has been well studied and it is clear today that a middle ground has to be sought between the skeptical approach and a conservative reaction to it
3055088 since his pauls oral preaching and his letters are of equal authority the community of thessalonica is to stand firm and hold to both 2 thes 2 15
3055089 the church experienced the need for continuing doctrinal authority to see to it that the biblical message was faithfully proclaimed and rightly interpreted
3055090 it is not surprising therefore that in certain passages from the gospels the apostles are addressed in a manner that would seem to include their successors for example matthew 28 19 20 jesus promises to remain present until the end of the age with those whom he sends to speak and act in his name
3055091 each bishop receives with ordination the three functions munera discussed above in chapter 1 those of sanctifying teaching and governing the capacity to exercise the munus of sanctifying as occurs in sacramental actions such as the consecration of the eucharist is inseparable from the order itself and can never be lost the munera of teaching and pastoral rule however cannot be exercised except by bishops in the hierarchical communities with the head and members of the episcopal college lg 22 hierarchical communion a condition for the exercise of these latter functions is ruptured by schism or heresy
3055092 again in his high priestly prayer jesus asks the father to consecrate his disciples in the truth jn 17 17 19
3055093 insofar as the holy spirit continues to keep the church in the truth through the testimony of duly commissioned witnesses the church perpetually remains apostolic
3055094 the prophets and teachers of antioch lay hands on barnabas and paul with prayer and fasting when sending them on their first missionary journey acts 13 3
3055095 barnabas and paul take pains to install presbyters in each of the churches they establish in asia minor peter and the twelve lay hands on representatives of the greek speaking christians at jerusalem acts 6 6
3055096 the preservation of continuity through duly commissioned spirit guided leaders is further developed in the pastoral letters paul instructs titus he likewise admonishes timothy
3055097 the idea of apostolic succession in the ordained ministry is beginning to emerge
3055098 the increasingly popular understanding of the gift as a commissioning to office making timothy the paradigm of later church officers to whom the gifts and authority for ministry were limited is out of place in this text
3055099 the language here and in the parallel text in 2 tim 1 6 will not bear the strain imposed by making charisma into office
3055100 paul in the second letter of timothy to titus he writes paul warns eph 4 14
3055101 if the angels of the seven churches of asia minor in the first three chapters of the book of revelation are as many believe bishops we have here a confirmation that by late new testament times each local church in asia minor may have had a single bishop as its pastor
3055102 the new testament exhibits church order in its formative stages but more time was needed for church order to assume its definitive form
3055103 together with the promise of perpetuity christ has given to the church the means whereby she can assuredly remain the pillar and the bulwark of the truth 1 tim 3 15 cf

3055113 we have all these different stories from everywhere he says he doesnt remember anything hes my client and i believe him until i see solid evidence that hes not who he says he is
3055114 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
3055115 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
3055116 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
3055117 it was a very hard fought series that drained a lot out of us
3055118 we showed a lot of character especially to come back after the galle test
3055119 i am very happy with the players because they played really good cricket throughout the series
3055120 we kept the standards high kept pushing ourselves and we never gave up
3055121 credit should go to the whole team i thought the difference was that we had a lot of contributions from different players throughout the series
3055122 whenever we were in a situation that we needed somebody to put their hand up do something for us they did it thats probably the most pleasing thing for me
3055123 the credit should go to the bowling unit for keeping india to a highest innings total of 329 in the whole series our guys went really hard at them and kept the pressure going
3055124 ajantha was brilliant adding a different dimension to the bowling attack
3055125 he has fitted into the dressing room well and has been very humble in all his achievements which is great to see
3055126 in terms of the bowling obviously mendis was the difference picking up 26 wickets
3055127 with murali muttiah muralitharan and mendis together it is not easy to get runs off them and we kept losing wickets because of the pressure created by the two of them
3055128 the batsmen didnt put up a good show here and it probably cost us the series
3055129 but professor x told us that we must always be completely honest with our subjects

3055152 it was a hard time for jujie and also for our family
3055153 but she did a wonderful job finally she is here and we are so proud to be here
3055154 for me today i dont think people care about what i do how i finished people mostly are proud of me youre in your 50s youve been retired 20 years you still can make olympic games
3055155 i told my husband i want to go to the beijing olympic games and my husband said juj you have nothing to lose
3055156 it doesnt matter once you put on a mask to fence this olympic games everybody knows im 50 so on the piste the long strip of floor the fencers compete on it doesnt matter whether i win or lose
3055157 i thought it was really exciting olympics and everything all the best fencers in the world and i guess i was really proud of my mom competing after so many years and her being so old and everything
3055158 i felt really nervous for her and i was really unsure what other people would think
3055159 you can go on the street just say her name and anybody over 30 years old they all know her
3055160 she told them she wont get a gold or even a medal and they still say that she must go
3055161 ive never really thought of my mom as a famous person ive never been amazed at all the stories because shes my mom
3055162 but every time we come back to china there are always random people who say arent you jujie they still recognize her thats pretty big
3055163 i remember when i was five there were people videotaping us eating and i said mommy what are they doing
3055164 she said just be normal they would come in and film me when i was sleeping this is jujies life i was like mom why are you so weird my friends their moms dont do this stuff so ive grown up with all this
3055165 ive never been really serious i play around a lot but i see how much shes been through and one of her dreams now is she wants me to go the olympics too and shes going to be really old and i dont want her trying again
3055166 now one of main reasons i want to go to the olympics one day is for her because its one of her wishes shes done so much for me i want to do something for her
3055167 he is a person who is exactly the same age as i am and he was full of life
3055168 he is a guy who inspires us and makes us laugh and the next thing you know he is gone so it was very sad for me
3055169 a style of his own and represented a kind of an attitude which came from the streets of america
3055170 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was underexploited in america but had great potential
3055171 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3055172 i remember when comedians in advance of his performance were booed off and the first thing that came out of his mouth as soon as he looked at the audience was im not scared of you mother s
3055173 he coined that phrase then and it became one of his top calling cards for his whole life
3055174 there were still moments when we thought he might say the wrong thing but there were still moments when we were on the edge of our seat not knowing what he was going to say next
3055175 everyone who knew him was touched by him he was generous
3055176 he had a very very very beautiful spirit he seemed very connected
3055177 for that were all going to miss him even more than his comedy
3055178 he was an individual there were many people who followed him who were inspired by him and borrowed his style and attitude
3055179 at 17 i had an opportunity to get the putt in first and i felt if i hole this i win the pga and if i miss sergio wins the pga
3055180 in a major i feel like i can be patient and take your time because you know its going to come down to who can do it under pressure for the last nine holes
3055181 im not going to put it 40 yards left of the green thats not the way i play
3055182 i tried to put a good solid swing on it and put it into the middle of the green i definitely feel like i played good enough to win
3055183 my mum and dad were saying it seems like two minutes since they used to take her to public swimming lessons at sherwood baths which is where she started
3055184 here they are watching one of their granddaughters win an olympic title it was just unbelievable for them
3055185 rebecca swims for shoes so im sure theres going to be a pair come her way
3055186 she also said if she won the gold medal when she comes back i had to promise to do her a sunday roast with yorkshire puddings
3055187 its just an absolutely fantastic achievement for her im so proud of her shes my new hero
3055188 this is a case where the lawyer told the courts in two counties that she couldnt be in both places at once
3055189 we know the courts need to carry on their business but as we have told everyone at the capitol and in the justice system along with losing 53 lawyer positions we have also lost the ability to do everything the courts want us to do as quickly as they want to do it the chief justice says there will be delays in the courts now and regretfully we are part of that problem

3055207 por qu una persona querr a vender una gallina por una moneda que no le sirve para comprar nada fuera de la comunidad
3055208 se est condenando a las personas a vivir como los peones en el siglo xix cuando les pagaban sus salarios con fichas que solamente pod an usar en las bodegas de la hacienda donde trabajaban
3055209 la existencia de dos precios para un mismo bien crea incentivos para el arbitraje puede ocurrir que un bien comprado con monedas comunales se venda luego en bol vares fuera del mercado
3055210 no creo que el bcv vaya a restringir la cantidad de bol vares para hacerle espacio a las monedas comunales entonces se podr a generar m s inflaci n porque se est n generando m s medios de pago
3055211 una de las causas de la inflaci n es por la emisi n desordenada de billetes
3055212 la comisi n se cuida mucho de dictar esas medidas y puede ordenarlas de oficio aunque no las soliciten pero ya no creo que la dicten en estos d as

3055228 my actions were shameful and hurtful and i fully understand the disgrace i have brought upon myself my family my party and yahoo fantasy baseball
3055229 believe me john isnt the type who would go so far as to completely decimate a team like that
3055230 he always tried to be as subtle as possible when illegally tampering with other teams and im pretty sure he would never have been so brazen as to pull a stunt like that
3055231 this league has no room for corruption and its supposed to be for acting members of congress anyway i mean who does this pretty boy think he is
3055232 he needs to be removed immediately obviously and the whole league should have an asterisk stamped on it for this year
3055233 i fully would expect this garbage out of a republican
3055234 republicans or so im told but a democrat is supposed to be above such petty and pathetic games if hes allowed to be in this league next year you can count me out that i assure you
3055235 it will be hard to bounce back from this no question
3055236 there will probably be some league somewhere that will take him in under heavy stipulations but i will have to say his time on the big stage is over this is a sad day for fantasy sports

3055255 we get people who have played for 30 years to someone whos a guitar herofreak and doesnt know how to play an instrument
3055256 song choice is based on what the drummer can play and what the singer can sing
3055257 ive had some groups where the guitar player didnt play all that much so i ended up playing their guitar parts on my bass were playing a rolling stones song and here i am playing the melody on my bass its fun for me as a counselor because it forces me to really be on my toes and shift gears pretty quickly its almost more like being a producer
3055258 this girl natalie she was from canada and she could just sing her tail off

3055274 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

3055282 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3055283 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3055284 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3055285 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3055286 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3055287 three and a half decades later this seems equally valid if not more so given the increased number of countries that are making significant investments in space

3055293 unfortunately the trial court incorrectly held that trademark holders and not ebay are responsible for policing the ebay site the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3055294 ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3055295 not unsympathetic to tiffany and other rights owners who have invested enormous resources in developing their brands only to see them illicitly and efficiently exploited by others on the internet
3055296 the law is clear it is the trademark owners burden to police its mark
3055297 a random sample of supposed tiffany silver jewelry offered on ebay was counterfeit

3055483 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market
3055484 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down

3055521 any kind of relief or help we can get from a cheaper source of oil could impact the agricultural industry tremendously throughout the country throughout the world
3055522 but certainly we have the ability and we have shown that over and over again that we can beat people on technology and applying that technology
3055523 even under harsh drought conditions with minimal amount of water or moisture it will survive
3055524 it think its going to be part of the equation
3055525 in the next four or five years i think well increase not only the fruits per jatropha tree but well also increase the amount of oil in each of those seeds
3055526 there are implications to dedicating more and more crop land to fuel production rather than food production
3055527 that comes in the form of tighter supplies for food production and that leads to higher prices

3055637 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3055638 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3055639 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3055640 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3055641 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3055642 hopefully this study underlines the importance of how crucial older matriarchs are to the health of elephant populations
3055643 protecting the leaders of elephant herds will be even more important in what may be an increase in droughts due to climate change

3055648 the mood of frugality that has led us consumers to seek out discount retailers such as wal mart and costco has increasingly spread to the affluent and wealthy according to a survey of attitudes in some of americas richest households the research based on interviews with 625 respondents who represent the wealthiest 10 per cent of us households found that 80 per cent said they were looking closely at every spending category to see where they could save up from 68 per cent in april

3055650 in recent data as much as 20 of oil price movements could be attributed to changes in the exchange rate or at least to news developments that matter for both exchange rates and oil prices but that also means that 80 of what we see happening to the price of oil is completely uncorrelated with whatever might be influencing the exchange rate

3055654 the government plans to expand this to deal with all violent offenders tens of thousands in strathclyde and we simply do not have resources to do that

3055656 it may be greater violence or greater supervision but you wont escape the cost

3055675 in many areas this is going to be a glorious grouse season but for other areas range contraction of red grouse caused by a burgeoning number of parasites is becoming a real problem
3055676 red grouse can suffer huge population crashes because of the parasitic strongyle worm in order to maintain our grouse stocks counter intuitively shooting older birds on the moor is a good way of controlling the disease as they often have very heavy worm burdens that will infect younger healthier birds
3055677 it is utterly ridiculous to label an industry which depends on the mass slaughter of wildlife for entertainment purposes as glorious barbaric and immoral would be far more appropriate under these circumstances
3055678 lets not kid ourselves that this is a glorious sport quite the contrary the reality is hundreds of thousands of birds will be driven towards waiting guns and blasted out of the sky in the name of entertainment
3055679 many people are also unaware of the further hidden cost that this sport causes indirectly in unnecessary suffering and death to a wide range of animals due to the rigorous predator control programmes that are undertaken on shooting estates in order to create an environment where the target species can be kept at unnaturally high population levels until the shooters arrive to decimate them

3055683 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3055684 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3055685 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3055686 bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3055687 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss

3055690 we have been able to prevent the failure of the cleaning mechanisms and to prove that
3055691 we will start screenings of compounds that could have the same effect we are also experimenting with different changes in diet that may also mimic this effect
3055692 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
3055693 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age
3055694 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3055695 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3055696 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3055697 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations
3055698 the companies insist that nothing is wrong but the complaints have been mounting through e mails water cooler discussions and message boards on apples own web site iphone 3g users are having trouble connecting and staying connected to the 3g networks in their areas

3055703 we believe our proposal is clearly superior for republics stockholders and is designed so we can work cooperatively with republic
3055704 waste managements bid is inline with the 36 38 range where we think the company could execute an all cash bid for republic without issuing additional equity and maintain its investment grade debt rating

3055707 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market
3055708 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3055709 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3055710 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3055711 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market

3055715 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock

3055719 when you have all those factors in place then you tend to have a higher birth rate
3055720 it wouldnt have taken into account any of the out migration that occurred due to 1804
3055721 thats certainly is an impact that is being seen in other states that have laws similar to 1804
3055722 once that hysteria for lack of a better word died down people see that the grass isnt greener on the other side
3055723 hispanics are coming here because they see that theres great opportunity
3055724 this is a great city if you want to raise your kids get a great education for your kids
3055725 most of the hispanic population in tulsa is not undocumented
3055726 we want to stay behind because we want to show that tulsa is a diverse city
3055727 yes we will provide you with credit but with higher costs in fees and interest rates
3055728 the number of hispanics is growing and the political participation is starting to grow
3055729 but its going to take a while before the voting numbers come up to reflect the population
3055730 we want to build the numbers so we have a voice
3055731 change our lifestyle to cope up with the petrol hike
3055732 predetermined mindset of the results of the study prior to engaging in any research
3055733 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3055734 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3055735 theres no way you would describe this effort at this point as anything but an overwhelming success thats important for two reasons
3055736 there could be developers sitting on the fence wondering how effective the apple store would be at reaching consumers
3055737 now they can see that lots of applications have been sold so perhaps they should put theirs up there as well
3055738 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that
3055739 we think going forward the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
3055740 the problem is that the other platforms lack a central store that people can easily go to that theyve already done business with and make purchases quickly from the store to the device
3055741 those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves
3055742 i freed thousands of slaves i could have freed thousands more if they had known they were slaves
3055743 is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
3055744 a christian man is the most free lord of all and subject to none a christian man is the most dutiful servant of all and subject to every one
3055745 speak lord your servant is listening draw me close to you and reveal your will to me remove any confusion from my heart and show me the path you have chosen for me jesus i will follow wherever you lead

3055753 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity he said
3055754 he buys fruit out of his own pocket coach bailey said
3055755 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
3055756 xavier nixon loves grapes he said of britts standout offensive lineman
3055757 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life he said
3055758 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
3055759 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line bailey said
3055760 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
3055761 hes gotten them from all the ivy league schools bailey said
3055762 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
3055763 its important for our family as much as it is for the team andrew said
3055764 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going

3055787 there is nobody who knows how broken the system is more than us everyone in the room could say they contributed to the polarization
3055788 the perceived polarization that exists in this country today is not a good thing
3055789 the reality is that despite enormous cultural differences elections are basically the same everywhere
3055790 there is almost always an initial resistance culturally most countries arent used to using the kind of hard hitting tactics and strategies we use
3055791 but as soon as they see that it might help their chances they are locked and loaded

3055845 the largest international affairs non profit organization in the united states
3055846 a private non profit non partisan educational organization dedicated to informing and engaging people of all ages on matters of national and international significance
3055847 choosing a venue finding an infrastructure supplier selling space to individual exhibitors the list is extensive and for a first time organiser can be incredibly daunting
3055848 of key concern to exhibitors organisers and exhibition and event attendees is the question of security all too often this issue is considered at the end of the planning stages and receives what is left of the budget as opposed to the funding and consideration it properly deserves
3055849 personal safety and the security covering stands and the products on display are crucially important to the success of an exhibition or event if visitors feel threatened or there is a high incidence of theft organisers will experience great difficulty in attracting both groups back to the show or event in the future
3055850 the average visitor will view security staff as the organisers staff and will not differentiate between the two it is also noteworthy that safety and security are key items in exsas judging criteria for exhibitions
3055851 a consultant provides an excellent communication channel for organisers to address the needs and concerns of all the relevant stakeholders organising an exhibition or event this ensures everyones needs are adequately addressed and that compliance issues are dealt with correctly security companies have someone who understands the unique challenges of their industry and organisers have assistance from an informed source who can recommend how best to secure a venue and manage the staff provided

3055861 for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ
3055862 sir i perceive that you are a prophet 20 our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you people jews say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship
3055863 woman believe me an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in jerusalem will you worship the father 22 you worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the jews 23 but an hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for such people the father seeks to be his worshipers 24 god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
3055864 therefore since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken let us show gratitude by which we may offer to god an acceptable service with reverence and awe
3055865 during the days of jesus life on earth he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death and he was heard because of his reverent submission
3055866 therefore i urge you brethren by the mercies of god to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to god which is your spiritual service of worship

3055873 i have low self esteem cuz im dark skinned and thats not accepted in the black community i mean im not bad lookin i have hair past my shoulders and i can dress my tail off so why do sic it matter the color of my skin im just as good as light skinned girls right
3055874 i dont kno w anymore im about to jus t give up whats the point in tryin when no ones gonna give me a chance
3055875 who has a better chance of getting ahead in todays economy
3055876 in 2001 only 10 of african americans owned shares of stock and
3055877 assign human worth and social status using whites as the paradigm or standard
3055878 society is prejudiced against those with dark skin as a result the desire for lighter skin is nearly universal accordingly for light skinned blacks it simply remains easier to get ahead
3055879 compared to light skinned blacks those with dark skin had less income and a lower standing including in the black community
3055880 those who are light skinned have a better chance at succeeding in politics and business achieving a higher education and gaining social status than those who are dark
3055881 a dark skinned black man can use his intelligence to compensate for his unfortunate coloring and if he is financially secure he may marry a light skinned woman thereby improving his own social position and that of his children at the same time a dark skinned black woman who feels herself unattractive may think that she has nothing to offer society no matter how intelligent or inventive she is
3055882 dark skinned blacks especially men are the most criminally dangerous
3055883 transformed into a commodity reduced to parts of her body and physically or ideologically
3055884 we have continued to pass judgment on each other it is not fair to criticize black people they are trying to be white who want to move out of rural urban or ghetto areas for the betterment of their personal future to provide a better life for their children whose vocabulary lacks certain slang and who work hard and take advantage of education
3055885 my object in living is to unite my avocation and my vocation as my two eyes make one in sight only where love and need are one ive toyed with quitting and just taking a year or two off to travel the world and explore its something ive always wanted to do and can afford to do financially but the practical side of me says its a foolish thing to consider you dont have to quit your job and explore the whole world at once plan two week vacations and select a small part of the world you want to see tuscany and florence london and outskirts paris and amsterdam etc put your practical and systematic qualities to good use planning your experiences if you could get away for a few days every 6 months youd have something to look forward to and something to talk about plus youd be absorbing new information about the world and about yourself does your alma mater have an alumni travel program that would be a way to meet people and learn new things you might have a botanist guiding you through the amazon or an art history prof leading you through the louvre good stuff you do get vacation leave dont you i just got a big raise and my feeling is complete and utter ambivalence i didnt ask for it or lobby for it i just got it and shrugged my shoulders i guess its nice but i dont really need the extra money i already make plenty well you must be bringing value to the company or they wouldnt have given you an unsolicited big raise companies cant run without good accountants sounds like you under estimate your own value and the value of the accounting profession if you no longer like the activity of accounting see a career counselor if you like accounting but dont like your work environment figure out what you dont like and seek to change those aspects or move on i can think of plenty of things to do with your money aside from travel my avocation and my vocation as my two eyes make one in sight only where love and need are one and the work is play for mortal stakes is the deed ever really done for heaven and the futures sakes
3055886 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
3055887 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth
3055888 it confirms that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
3055889 many of these bacteria have not been described because they are quite hard to grow in the lab and when you go further down into the digestive system it gets even harder to do this
3055890 these bacteria are thought to have an involvement in dental caries and other mouth problems so describing them gives you a broader picture of the causation of these
3055891 over the last two weeks how often have you been bothered by the following problem thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way
3055892 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead
3055893 we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed
3055894 pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives
3055895 it is normal to experience distress after a cancer diagnosis
3055896 but for some patients emotional distress or depression becomes a problem in itself and may lead to suicidal thoughts
3055897 cancer specialists and gps can provide treatment with the help of psychiatrists if necessary

3055979 were the conservatives that believed that the colonies should not be under british rule but they did believe that the country should be run by a small wealthy elite or an imperial royal family with nobles and land owners as the nations rulers
3055980 many of the conservatives one being the well to do colonist
3055981 has since declined and degenerated to a point where some refer to todays republican party as to just being a well organized
3055982 we are the bosses just forget the us constitution as its just an old piece of paper anyway

3055995 in front of me covering the whole 100 foot wall of the room was a map with a spider web like maze of natural gas pipelines reaching from east siberia west to the atlantic ocean and from the arctic ocean south to the caspian and black seas

3056008 it was a case unfortunately of wrong place wrong time
3056009 to my knowledge it was not a drawn out event
3056010 i think it happened quite quickly and i dont think there was anything said
3056011 her injuries were significant but the surgical team at the chinese hospital has done a marvelous job of repairing the wounds and giving her the best possible chance of recovery
3056012 she physically is unscathed but having to deal with this event has been hard for her shes shown incredible strength a lot of tears and a lot of hugs

3056142 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment

3056145 de gedaalde olieprijs en de sterkere dollar geven steun aan de beurs bedrijven die actief zijn in de vs profiteren van een stijging van de amerikaanse munt dat de stijging vandaag niet heel uitbundig was is logisch gezien de ferme klim van de afgelopen weken

3056152 these people love you man theyll follow you anywhere youre like moses black moses
3056153 didnt say im the black moses of the black world they said of the music world
3056154 music is universal but sometimes presentation will restrict you or limit your range
3056155 glen campbell and jim webb were targeting the pop audience but when i did it i aimed to the black market but it was so big it went all over

3056160 die britten hebben gewoon een goed team dat wordt echt geen appeltje eitje voor ons zo hoort het natuurlijk ook we zijn hier wel op de olympische spelen
3056161 logisch dat je dan even uit je dak gaat als het allemaal goed afloopt maar nu gaan we ons voorbereiden op de britten dat is een fitte sterke ploeg die overal op het veld druk zet daarmee moeten we rekening houden maar we moeten er ook van kunnen profiteren
3056162 iedereen had er ook ongelooflijk veel zin in bij ons de eerste helft was niet fantastisch nee we bleken toch een beetje moeite met de vermeende last van de openingswedstrijd te hebben ook de olympische debutanten moesten even op gang komen we speelden voor de rust met iets te weinig lef we moesten er even doorheen komen
3056163 bij 16 10 achter hebben we de eerste set laten lopen
3056164 als het niet loopt zijn we toch in staat met hard werken er bovenop te komen daar zijn we goed in geworden
3056165 dat gepiel we spelen liever tegen teams die net als wij hard slaan
3056166 je moet fel beginnen lukt dat dan lopen we over ze heen ik denk dat we toch hier al hebben laten zien dat we tot de beste teams van het toernooi behoren

3056177 they can really appreciate what youre doing technically or physically and thats really cool

3056183 my role here is to be a coach for these young players just to be able to give them that encouragement and that knowledge that ive gained over the first four years of my career

3056185 to go over to a country where their first language is not your language they know me as josh smiss i love it

3056187 we get counted out every year but thats motivation we dont want to be known as the top team every year we want to be in that class where nobody really talks about us so we can kind of sneak in like we did last year and make the playoffs
3056188 well be good it gives us another year to jell and weve been together for so long it seems like unfortunately we lost a brother in josh childress and i certainly wish him good luck over there in greece but i feel if we do the right things like we did last year if we work hard we dont have anything to worry about

3056206 math and science teachers are in such need it almost goes without saying anymore
3056207 its unusual to not have more english teacher applications coming in
3056208 it seems that math teachers in junior high are being asked to teach science too so they need another credential for that
3056209 you would hope that with algebra becoming an eighth grade requirement they would also change the credential requirements to teach it

3056219 since everyone seems to promise me essentially the same thing ive decided to go with character and perceived leadership thats why for the first time ever im decorating my yard with a sign for steve ward for congress
3056220 i was most impressed with your details on your website and debate performances i recognize your unique blend of legislative executive military and business experience in addition your personality thank you for giving us voters a worthy choice
3056221 steve your understanding of the economic issues and the inflation of the dollar through the governments and federal reserves printing of worthless paper money alone is worth of my support

3056232 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3056233 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3056234 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3056235 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3056236 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3056237 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3056238 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3056239 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3056240 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody
3056241 hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife

3056244 but my dad made me stick it out a year

3056247 walked into a room and the adults were on one side he would end up on the other side with the kids casey stengel said he looked in a mirror and saw a young man trapped in an old mans body thats jack but as coaches i think were all a little that way
3056248 i think the highlight was getting my picture taken with the teams
3056249 its just a very energetic feeling you know they represent the best of u s athletics and they were really excited about their events and theyre full of hope it was just a very uplifting experience
3056250 its an international games there are people from all over the world watching and not cheering madly
3056251 i was watching michael phelps after the anchor leg touched
3056252 the whole thing is genuine thats the good thing about the olympics
3056253 theyre genuinely pleased that the president came to support them
3056254 and i really believe that it helps them realize the country is supporting them a lot of people are pulling for them

3056256 i am going to grant him bail but it must be on the clear understanding what the sentence will be

3056258 it is a series of messages followed by a series of threats

3056260 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to work hard and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game

3056341 this pattern of attack appears aimed not at restoring any status quo ante in south ossetia but rather at toppling the democratically elected government of georgia
3056342 that makes russias recent actions against the georgians all the more alarming
3056343 in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake

3056352 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3056353 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3056354 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
3056355 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
3056356 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

3056363 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
3056364 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
3056365 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
3056366 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
3056367 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
3056368 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
3056369 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
3056370 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3056371 the goal of this operation is regime change in georgia
3056372 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry

3056383 do you think you could bring your truck around and give it good watering

3056385 we saw them cut down the pink trees that were on the corner

3056411 weve been encouraging black men to get screened at age 40 or 45 for more than a decade yet only one third of these high risk men reported being tested
3056412 blood levels of a protein called prostate specific antigen or psa typically rise when a man has prostate cancer so psa testing is often used to screen for the disease
3056413 it is generally recommended that men discuss psa screening for prostate cancer with their doctors starting at age 50 however the american cancer society recommends screening at age 45 for african american men or earlier if there is a strong family history
3056414 well you know what im done with it i say let those scientologists have their xenu im calling my agent and demanding a trade id rather play somewhere where im wanted than deal with these false idol worshippers for another minute

3056421 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
3056422 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
3056423 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
3056424 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
3056425 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
3056426 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
3056427 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
3056428 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
3056429 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
3056430 we are now in a fight against the great russia
3056431 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
3056432 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
3056433 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too
3056434 by delivering local news and information in a more visually appealing way we will make the suns valuable coverage more accessible to more people
3056435 it was intelligent thought out and dramatic a tour de force package thats going to help re write the tribune co and newspapers
3056436 a recently uncovered breach of their reporters phone records in the course of a national security investigation nearly four years ago
3056437 mueller called the top editors at each paper to express regret that agents had not followed proper procedures when they sought telephone records under a process that allowed them to bypass grand jury review in emergency cases
3056438 records of new york times reporters raymond bonner and jane perlez who worked in jakarta in 2004 also were compromised
3056439 the fbi refused to disclose the nature or subject of the investigation that prompted the request for the phone records
3056440 at the time the reporters were writing articles about islamic terrorism in southeast asia
3056441 i thanked director mueller for calling and informing us of this and apologizing
3056442 i told him that we would be asking our general counsel to look into this
3056443 results for the first half and second quarter of 2008 were impressive in the context of this challenging economic and advertising climate
3056444 we reported higher revenue and earnings per share for the second quarter and continued to outperform many in the media arena strong relative performance in both outdoor and radio are a testament to the wisdom of continuing to do what we do best

3056449 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3056450 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3056451 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3056452 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3056453 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3056454 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3056455 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
3056456 results for the first half and second quarter of 2008 were impressive in the context of this challenging economic and advertising climate
3056457 we reported higher revenue and earnings per share for the second quarter and continued to outperform many in the media arena strong relative performance in both outdoor and radio are a testament to the wisdom of continuing to do what we do best

3056470 the more things change the more they certainly stay the same
3056471 did we still want to buy all this ice cream every year for the kids maybe we were ruining their teeth by giving them ice cream one day a year who would bake the hams next year we have 1 872 00 in our reunion account should we buy new volleyball nets do we need to come up with some new games to keep the teenagers happy during the afternoon who will be in charge of organizing the little kids games and contests next year who got married who had babies who had babies and did not get married
3056472 how about i fill your plate up for you you look tired and im afraid you will trip over something
3056473 if we do not try a generational change in education now it will be too late
3056474 we can no longer look at growth rates of 5 10 percent a quantum leap is what is required
3056475 in the next few decades india will probably have the largest set of young people in the world given this demographic advantage we are optimally positioned to leapfrog in the race for social and economic development
3056476 la existencia aqu es dura pero estamos acostumbrados es parte de nuestra cultura a mi no me gusta estar en los campamentos de refugiados de argelia ni en las zonas ocupadas por marruecos vivir libre a pesar de las dificultades es lo mejor
3056477 desde aqu pod is observar los tanques los soldados y a veces sus aeronaves es una amenaza constante pero esta es mi tierra y de aqu no me van a echar
3056478 los restos del lucrativo negocio de las armas se encuentran por todas partes y lamentablemente muchos de los pa ses con responsabilidades hist ricas que pretenden mostrarse como mediadores neutrales se ven directamente involucrados en el desproporcionado rearme del ej rcito ocupante
3056479 obviamente este es el caso de espa a y francia
3056480 al pueblo saharaui no lo ha organizado ni las agencias de ayuda humanitaria de las naciones unidas ni ning n gobierno u o ng fueron ellos mismos quienes mostraron una incre ble capacidad para crear estructuras en medio de la nada las mujeres mostraron una fortaleza y determinaci n decisiva que perdura hasta nuestros d as
3056481 se trata de una medida temporal pues para ellos es importante recordar que todo esto se realiz siempre con la idea de regresar a su tierra
3056482 es que la gente solo visualiza los campamentos de refugiados de tindouf y no sabe que ya existe un territorio liberado adem s del ocupado
3056483 el sahara occidental tiene cientos de kil metros de playas y mar ciudades y minas muy ricas no es un p ramo como a veces se da a entender
3056484 la gente en los territorios ocupados lo pasa muy mal los activistas pro derechos humanos son torturados desaparecidos y encarcelados si hubiese una orden pol tica de acudir en su auxilio la acatar a ahora mismo
3056485 aparentemente la milicia del polisario cuenta con un material militar que dif cilmente podr a contrarrestar la capacidad ofensiva de la dictadura marroqu pero esto mismo se pens en los setenta y la sorpresa fue que aguantamos y golpeamos durante mas de quince a os hasta el d a de hoy la voluntad de un pueblo es su mejor arma
3056486 aqu lo que hay es un claro intercambio entre espa a y marruecos si marruecos contiene la emigraci n ilegal espa a se calla sobre el sahara si espa a les vende tanques marruecos les deja el banco pesquero saharaui y as con la droga el terrorismo isl mico etc que me perdonen pero es la verdad
3056487 pero para nosotros lo mas doloroso es lo del psoe desde que felipe gonz lez vino aqu en los setenta hablando sobre nuestro derecho a la autodeterminaci n hasta la actualidad con moratinos hemos recibido una pu alada por la espalda tras otra al menos con en el pp sabemos que no tenemos nada
3056488 la mejor a y la buena vecindad que el pp nunca tuvo con marruecos
3056489 es como poner tiritas a un herido que se est desangrando
3056490 aqu cada observador de la o nu tiene un veh culo nuevo un sueldo de ocho mil euros al mes los mejores hoteles helic pteros y todo para que qu observan cu ndo nos ayudan somos arrestados y torturados de manera sistem tica y ellos no hacen mas que mirar para otro lado
3056491 la represi n ha aprendido de nuevas formas de tortura menos obvias pero igual de terror ficas como son la ba era la bolsa y el pollo
3056492 los traen en camiones y autobuses desde las zonas mas deprimidas del reino llegan exhaustos y los dejan tirados a su suerte en la costa aunque ellos no sufren la violencia sistem tica que nosotros soportamos tambi n ellos son maltratados por el r gimen absolutista nuestra lucha no es contra el pueblo marroqu sino contra el rey mohamed vi y sus militares corruptos
3056493 lo est n empezando a hacer con los activistas mas valientes que como suele suceder muy a menudo son los mas j venes los violan y despu s los dejan abandonados en el desierto eso para la dignidad del saharaui es algo muy duro
3056494 eso es un infierno al que la o nu no presta ninguna atenci n all se cometen cientos de abusos de los derechos humanos adem s de desapariciones forzadas hay mucha gente que ha sido arrestada y no se le ha vuelto a ver
3056495 quieren perder tiempo y asimilarnos que nos disolvamos en marruecos al igual que en otros conflictos el tiempo siempre juega a favor del ocupante aqu por ejemplo ya hay una especie de junta de saharauis pro marroqu es que viven muy bien es triste reconocerlo pero empiezan a ser muchos los que no han aguantado y se han vendido
3056496 incluso en el caso de que acept semos la falsa autonom a impuesta por rabat no vivir amos en un estado de derecho pues el marco de una monarqu a absolutista no es garante de nada aqu es hasta ilegal cuestionar de manera pacifica la integridad territorial qu futuro nos espera en un pa s as
3056497 marruecos no quiere un refer ndum de ninguna forma nosotros hemos aceptado incluso que todos los marroqu es que vinieron aqu antes de 1999 puedan votar pero ni a n as quieren permitirnos autodeterminarnos
3056498 las madres las estudiantes y las hijas nos organizamos junto con nuestros compa eros en la mas absoluta clandestinidad
3056499 y por supuesto tambi n sufrimos las palizas o los golpes de la polic a en nuestras manifestaciones no se vaya a pensar que por ser mujeres nos pegan menos
3056500 grabamos nuestras acciones y las colgamos en internet tenemos la esperanza de que la gente nos vea resistir y se sume a nuestras reivindicaciones democr ticas all en europa les importa mucho la democracia verdad

3056593 you cant take a building you want to weatherize put it on a ship to china and then have them do it and send it back
3056594 so we are going to have to put people to work in this country weatherizing millions of buildings putting up solar panels constructing wind farms those green collar jobs can provide a pathway out of poverty for someone who has not gone to college
3056595 you can make more money if you put down that handgun and pick up a caulk gun

3056609 we wanted our daughter to know her parents were married that was the big thing for us
3056610 our journey to parenthood was not easy cheap or fun
3056611 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter

3056613 for future generations knowing they can fall in love get married have a child absolutely that will become a way of life more than it is

3056622 what weve tried to do is have consent forms that make it very clear what the intentions of the people are
3056623 whos going to be the mom whos going to be the dad what might happens if relationship ends if someone dies
3056624 if you dont have an exit strategy the usual result is that you have potentially several years of litigation which is extremely damaging to the child
3056625 its incumbent on everyone to be very thoughtful about entering these arrangements
3056626 as gay men so much depends on where you live what your social support system is like

3056671 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3056672 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3056673 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3056674 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3056675 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3056748 it provided a very important but limited safety net to gay and lesbian families
3056749 i dont believe rights should be rationed for selected groups for selected reasons
3056750 its counterproductive to encourage a more adversarial relationship between different parts of the community
3056751 even if people register i still advise them to talk to an attorney

3056756 the bible does not address the matter of appropriate behavior for those who are for whatever reason homosexual by instinct or nature
3056757 es una lata porque tuvimos muchas m s posibilidades nosotros en el primer set y creo que ellos jugaron muy bien sus puntos importantes
3056758 obvio que nos habr a gustado ganar pero perder es parte de esto ahora nos queda el single y hay jugarse por entero

3056761 fue un partido muy apretado muy dif cil de muy buen nivel y que se decidi en dos o tres puntos pero me queda una sensaci n de que les falt un poquito de suerte porque tuvieron 12 break points en el primer set ciertamente que tampoco hay que restarles m rito a los rusos porque se equivocaron muy poco

3056835 allowing the general public people with a grudge to complain to a grand jury would be fraught with abuse
3056836 in some cases a private person might be bent on pursuing an ill motive or vindictive agenda for instance political candidates on the eve of an election might charge their opponents with fraud or some other nefarious activity and request admission to the grand jury
3056837 the opinion shows that for legal practical and ethical reasons the criminal justice system is not well served by creating the equivalent of open mike night before the grand jury
3056838 open the floodgates to countless requests to appear before a grand jury
3056839 i have a lot more confidence in the citizens of this state than the supreme court does
3056840 the prosecutors offices in this state have hundreds of experienced and well trained attorneys many of whom have made law enforcement their career
3056841 we have no reason to believe they cannot be trusted to bring before the grand jury meritorious complaints of potential criminal conduct and to weed out frivolous allegations unworthy of presentation
3056842 i think the supreme court has exaggerated confidence in the abilities of the attorney general and the county prosecutor to deal with issues of misconduct in government
3056843 hi we liked your profile my friend found her boyfriend on here so we thought wed try too
3056844 if the pregnancy is uncomplicated and the delivery is at 37 weeks or more the only predictor of gbs disease in the baby is maternal colonization
3056845 the risk increases if the mother had a urinary tract infection with gbs before delivery the mother has ruptured membranes more than 18 hours before delivery premature water break or the mothers womb is infected with gbs before delivery the signs are fever tender abdomen high white blood count in the blood
3056846 women should receive penicillin or cefazolin for those allergic to penicillin by vein at least four hours before delivery
3056847 if the baby is born before culture screening has been done women should ask their doctor to perform cultures and treat if necessary

3056861 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3056862 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem
3056863 its rare for a whole team of sierra leoneans to go abroad and come back

3056874 this is a part of australian history and the australian past its not the most comfortable of discussions but music and art that is going on at the time the job of music and art is to reflect the political at an emotional level its the telling of the issues that are being talked about
3056875 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3056876 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o ves the ladies
3056877 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
3056878 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of cheques with our show making fun of christians
3056879 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3056880 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

3056918 happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony
3056919 i dont think that applies to me because after all ive done and the way i take care of my body im not even concerned with that i see some guys who havent even played as long as ive played theyre missing practices and not able to play every game
3056920 im aware of where im at because that was one of things that was important to me when i came into the game
3056921 i feel good im still interested in it so ill be in one of those top fives no doubt im not worried about that
3056922 i just hope in some way shape or form it doesnt work against you in the competition part of it
3056923 i dont think it will i think the audition process is more for matt to show where he is at and what hes capable of i just think they know what theyve got with me
3056924 the tank is pretty much on empty as far as patience goes with that
3056925 there are going to be penalties i understand that but when there are selfish penalties when there are penalties where guys emotions are getting the best of them unsportsmanlike conducts or personal fouls those things we are not going to tolerate
3056926 most teams when theyre scouting me say im not very physical and theyre going to come at me to see if ill hit
3056927 i mean look at whats going on with our offensive line right now

3056939 this operation will affect many people who live around here
3056940 i dont know much about it the owner of the company leased the property from me
3056941 this operation will affect many people who live around here we are very worried about our wells our air quality our property values roads noise and the river as they plan to put up a big port to ship the rock to new orleans
3056942 my lands not of interest to the rock quarry but theyre going to put in a port just up the river
3056943 when we bought our homes or lots years ago it was residential property
3056944 we all have wells around here and all our wells are in sandstone
3056945 when they start blasting our wells could be just taken away and wed have no water there are 50 to 60 families out here and its just very upsetting
3056946 they had a rock quarry that was here for six or eight months and our road was just torn all to pieces it took us 12 or 13 years to get it resurfaced
3056947 theres so little law to protect a homeowner or individual against something like this in faulkner county
3056948 theres nobody here looking out for us in the county there are laws that protect us but they are reluctant to enforce them
3056949 we think they need an individual permit for the environmental impact
3056950 they need to do a study and see if its still manageable to have a rock quarry
3056951 its between 15 16 million of rock its a lot of money you know its hard to fight that kind of money
3056952 the location is good for us for anything we do in mayflower
3056953 logistically it takes us two hours to take a load from greenbrier to mayflower and now we will be able to haul 20 loads a day per truck
3056954 it will save on fuel and a lot of things well be able to greater serve and maintain the roads in mayflower
3056955 i dont think the trucks will affect the roads that much
3056956 were going to try and get rock wherever we can get it
3056957 they just dont want a quarry theyre throwing up things to try and stop us
3056958 hes got good plans and is trying to do everything correct hes trying to buy land from those nearby
3056959 he wants people to sell out because their property isnt going to be worth anything
3056960 all rock quarries start out small they get bigger and bigger because no one wants to live next to them so they end up selling out cheap

3056980 the ultimate goal of our work over the last ten years has been to find an effective therapy for cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes we began by characterizing the unusual clinical features and debilitating impact of caps and then discovered the underlying genetic basis of the disease
3056981 the ultimate goal of our work over the last ten years has been to find an effective therapy for cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes we began by characterizing the unusual clinical features and debilitating impact of caps and then discovered the underlying genetic basis of the disease a major concern was whether a pharmaceutical company would expend the significant resources necessary to develop a treatment for a disease that has been diagnosed in only a few hundred patients in the united states
3056982 these publications highlight that scientists clinicians and industry can collaborate to efficiently yet rigorously develop therapies for rare diseases with significant unmet medical need as a result of this collaboration patients with caps now have an approved treatment available that can help them to effectively manage their disease
3056983 the development process for arcalyst for the treatment of caps highlights regenerons overall approach to drug development
3056984 in this case recognizing that il 1 is an active mediator of inflammatory disease we developed arcalyst to potently inhibit il 1 in the bloodstream before it can bind to its receptors once it was recognized that the genetic mutation associated with caps is associated with il 1 overproduction we rapidly initiated a pilot study to determine the clinical impact of il 1 inhibition with arcalyst based upon the clear cut responses experienced by the caps patients in the pilot study we then developed a validated instrument to assess the severity of caps symptoms over time and introduced that instrument into two randomized placebo controlled pivotal study phases

3057075 this is still the worst case of fraud in us history and we are not going away with just three settlements
3057076 as far as we are concerned every bank or stock brokerage firm involved in the auction rate securities fraud is little more than a pitiful lying cockroach of a company you call your institutions you are nothing more than thieves that deceived 150 000 unsuspecting us citizens out of what in many cases was their life savings pay up or we start getting specific
3057077 there has been so much lying and deception involving auction rate securities that we cannot believe people are not going to jail as an example on friday august 8 2008 a commentator on cnbc described auction rate securities victims as rich people

3057115 first quarter earnings came in at 1 74 a share as a result of escalating prices well above the 1 50 analysts were looking for then second quarter results blew away the first quarter returns and set a new profit record
3057116 potash posted earnings of 905 1 million 2 82 per share a 220 increase over the 88c per share earned in the same period of 2007 it was the highest quarterly profit in the companys history 62 above the previous record
3057117 as a result of these strong gains and the expectation of continued high demand the company again raised its earnings forecast for the full year this time to 12 13 per share for the third quarter net income is expected to be in the range of 3 25 3 75 per share
3057118 looking ahead we can expect more of the same demand for fertilizer nutrients remains strong china recently settled its 2008 potash contract prices at us 400 a metric ton higher than the 2007 levels
3057119 of course potash is an international commodity and we could see a price correction however the world food shortage is a real and growing threat everything points to continuing strength in the potash markets for the foreseeable future as countries ramp up food production
3057120 pots management is certainly confident the company recently announced large expansions at its allan cory and rocanville mines all scheduled for completion in 2012 given the outlook and rapidly rising earnings i think that potash has a lot of upside potential despite these difficult markets

3057130 valero operates 16 oil refineries across north america with a combined throughput capacity of over 3 million barrels per day bpd
3057131 high oil prices have helped energy companies book record profits refiners however have seen profits plummet because the difference in price between a barrel of refined product and a barrel of crude oil the so called crack spread narrowed
3057132 thanks to higher selling prices vlo reported a 49 year over year increase in net revenues in q1 however due to the surge in oil prices the companys throughput margin shrank 30 to 8 48 per barrel
3057133 the operating profit margin was further impacted by higher energy costs net income from continuing operations plunged 76 year over year to 261 million or 48 cents per share
3057134 similarly q2 net revenues increased 51 year over year and the throughput margin fell 40 from the year earlier period to 10 82 per barrel net income from continuing operations dropped 64 to 734 million or 1 37 per share
3057135 although margins were down year over year they improved considerably over q1 levels while oil prices remain high and volatile we are encouraged that they have been easing in recent weeks
3057136 vlos profit margins will expand even if gasoline prices fall as long as they hold up better than oil prices we are optimistic this will happen because gasoline did not rise as much as oil to begin with
3057137 ive spotted an excellent opportunity to cash in on the turnaround of one of americas most visible companies starbucks
3057138 ive had my eye on a number of retail stocks for some time now looking for signs of a potential turnaround and starbucks is now high on my list
3057139 one of the main reasons for the slide in sbux shares from its high of 40 in november 2006 was the overly aggressive expansion plan
3057140 and as food and dairy prices have soared this has led to higher operating costs in turn this forced starbucks to raise prices just as consumers were struggling from the housing slump and soaring inflation
3057141 and as competition from the likes of mcdonalds and dunkin donuts has turned up the heat starbucks has suffered charges related to closing out unprofitable stores but starbucks is tackling the problems
3057142 declining sales along with its falling stock price has hit starbucks like a double shot of espresso at 7 00 am so the firm has gone back to basics launching its revival from the top
3057143 starbucks has re hired the man responsible for the companys success ceo howard schultz having served as ceo from 1987 to 2000 schultz helped starbucks grow from 100 coffee shops to 15 756 stores today
3057144 his knowledge and experience should help greatly in turning starbucks around he wants to return to the companys roots the coffee the consumer and the starbucks experience more specifically schultz plans to reform starbucks in the following ways
3057145 i like what i hear about starbucks transformation but in the current environment the key to boosting business is pricing people are willing to pay for the starbucks experience as long as the price is within reason
3057146 schultzs strategy of soft pedaling growth in mature markets while investing more heavily overseas reminds me of the mcdonalds plan in the early 2000s it worked too its share price has more than quadrupled since 2003
3057147 and schultzs return has attracted some much bigger customers too
3057148 typically he pressures companies to focus on their core businesses and dump less profitable ventures he will reinforce starbucks raison detre a coffee house do coffee and do it well and people will return
3057149 the return of schultz and his rebuilding plan along with investments by peltz and ainslie has had a positive effect on sbux shares over the last month

3057157 we have been trying to play a bit more positively as a coaching staff we asked the boys about five or six weeks ago to try to find an extra pass
3057158 we wanted to ask some better questions of our opposition its not an easy place to win
3057159 i just wanted to do everyone proud it was just so special being out there
3057160 my defence wasnt on par there are some big boys out there
3057161 i have got some work to do on that i got a bit roughed up out there but that was something youd expect i wish i could have scored that try
3057162 back to school tomorrow ive got to study for end of term tests
3057163 in all honesty he isnt really ready for first grade but i wanted to see how he did handle it
3057164 he was probably a little overawed but individually he came up with some brilliant things
3057165 promise yourself to forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future
3057166 it crossed my mind that there was no way i was going to make up all that ground
3057167 but then i said to myself im at the olympics and im here for the united states of america and i got a supercharge of emotion that just took it from there
3057168 to break a world record by nearly four seconds and not win the gold quite a show was put on for everyone
3057169 i wouldnt say it was alain who lost i would say it was the americans who won
3057170 it might take 20 odd years but youve got to experience everything
3057171 we were actually lucky we didnt hit them it was just fortunate it happened today monday if it happened tomorrow in the repecharge bad luck that would be the end of us
3057172 i was swearing like you wouldnt believe and then i said right lets get this boat in and lets get it sorted
3057173 our bow man david dennis was nervous it was touch and go hitting the canadian boat
3057174 it would have been instant disqualification an appeal can go in but its one that i wouldnt want to fight
3057175 we know that what happened wasnt our fault and we were settling into a nice rhythm when it happened
3057176 no rugby leagues given me so many great things and this club has as well so there might be an opportunity out there to make a bit more money but i think i owe the club and game plenty
3057177 so im not going to leave the game to chase some bigger cheque
3057178 for that sort of money id dance for them if they wanted me to
3057179 it is obvious that as world champions our biggest strengths are in the lineout and in the scrum
3057180 and it is precisely here where the opposition will try and neutralise us
3057181 we have picked up three things that they do which are illegal in the lineouts
3057182 it starts with their flanker coming through the lineout illegally to stop any ball thrown down to the scrumhalf they also do their best to play the lineout jumpers in the air and jump across the line and then thirdly they manage to close the gap to a half a metre between the two sets of players
3057183 i texted my mum right when it happened kobe asked about my leg she was shocked as well she couldnt believe it
3057184 and it really meant something to me because hes a huge superstar
3057185 i kind of believe that i dont have to put on a certain image just because i run the 100m dash
3057186 sometimes when youre a child and your parents see someone act a certain way on tv and theyre doing something they dont approve of or theyre showing off and they say oh hes cocky or hes this then you know not to be like that so thats kind of like how ive always been and theres really nothing changed
3057187 there hasnt been this much hype around a 100m dash in a long time
3057188 having three guys that have run 9 7 in the same race and two more guys 9 8 are going to be in the race as well its amazing
3057189 those two guys have done things that a lot of people have never seen before
3057190 and myself ive got a world championship under my belt and the american record so i fall into that class of the 9 7 runners
3057191 i think thats what makes it so amazing because i remember when those 100m records were 9 high 10 0
3057192 for people to say you cant run that fast thats whats even more amazing for three guys who can run 9 7 anything is possible
3057193 i know i ran 9 6 with a lot of wind but im pretty sure i can run just as fast with not that much wind as well
3057194 i dont really know if theres any limit to how fast someone can run
3057195 basically were adapting when bolt ran 9 72 i realised in order to beat him i have to run 9 6 or faster so thats what im trying to train my mind train my thoughts to do run 9 6
3057196 i couldnt even tell you what she says she just knows what to say to calm me down
3057197 i was getting my suit zipped up and it broke and i had to do a quick change and the lzrs arent the easiest thing to get into
3057198 i was a bit stressed out libby was a great help in mentally settling me down
3057199 i had a suit malfunction before the semi finals and jess did the same for me then
3057200 but jesss situation was a little bit harder to deal with so close to the final she did an amazing job to re focus and get in there and fight the whole way
3057201 calmed her down a little bit its really emotional when something like that happens before a big race
3057202 before the race i felt like i was going to vomit
3057203 but then this amazing sense of calm came over me and i knew that more than anything i wanted to walk away with no regrets
3057204 she nailed the start even with the crowd and once i saw the first few strokes and she set it up really well i felt very confident
3057205 thats all you can ask to come in and swim a pb personal best in the olympic final is more than i could have hoped for its blown me away
3057206 i have now equalled what i did in athens but its switched around she won gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay and bronze in the 50m freestyle in 2004 anything from now on is a bonus
3057207 jess has pushed me all the way from the beginning i would not be here without her
3057208 el santo oficio de un auto de fe para escarmiento de los herejes
3057209 its very easy to go around and say lets end the war if we had a democratic president we would end the war
3057210 knowing what we know now i would never have voted for it
3057211 the mistakes were made by this president who misled this country and this congress
3057212 let me throw these last five points because ive got to get out of here by six
3057213 were not playing the fourth quarter its late and weve got to get home to watch desperate housewives
3057214 will the enemy respect that we have lost our will to fight and are too busy to continue the war on terror
3057215 doing anything he can to get his name on the ballot
3057216 oh ive got to run the people need me to take over and lead before the current criminal class in politics ruins everything
3057217 who john orman whos john orman so what he wants to run for what against lieberman whats wrong with lieberman oh he voted for the war and now thinks the war is the right thing well we cant have that go get him
3057218 in my career i have observed characteristics about officers that enable me to determine the source from which they were commissioned
3057219 you came into the navy through the navys reserve officer training corps
3057220 well lieutenant throughout our conversation you demonstrated that you have a strong academic background but so far your military experience is somewhat limited
3057221 you came in through o c s officer candidate school and have prior enlisted service
3057222 again throughout the course of our conversation you demonstrated that you have a fairly complete military background and a lot of common sense
3057223 yes i have lieutenant you were commissioned when you graduated from the united states naval academy
3057224 that is correct sir and may i ask if you determined that by taking note of my high level of intelligence precise military bearing or some other superior quality that i have acquired and honed at the united states naval academy

3057247 im not real worried about it at the same time i dont want to keep on plowing through something and make it worse i just need to give it a couple days to get some inflammation out of there
3057248 its the exact opposite of being chilled to the bone
3057249 but sir it is the finest turkish leather very tough all kinds of weather
3057250 okay well im not going to be jumping through rings of fire wearing the jacket
3057251 i was on the cover of sports illustrated once back at marquette
3057252 but this is the first one thats just for me i want to do it right
3057253 it feels great to be on the verge of something big this is like the calm before the storm for me as a kid you always dream of becoming a celebrity its something to be cherished and done the right way its a powerful thing to be a public figure a role model you have to be careful
3057254 i feel like to an extent its already started in miami
3057255 im from the chi but the yankees make the best hats
3057256 its the typical grew up in the hood thing my family wasnt poor but we definitely werent rich either there were some tough times
3057257 it was scary the things wade did in the kentucky game
3057258 i looked up a couple times to make sure it was still no 3 i was watching on tape and not no 23 he was that sensational
3057259 i remember watching him play as a sophomore in the conference usa tournament and what i saw was unbridled talent
3057260 we started following him closely after that watching a lot of his games on tape we noticed that he had a tendency to start slow kind of lulling people to sleep while he got his teammates involved to be honest at the time we almost looked at it as a weakness wed be watching the tape and saying things like whens wade gonna make something happen then by the end of the tape wed be saying this guys amazing after watching one of those games we started calling him the closer because of the way he would just take over games down the stretch and just will his team to wins
3057261 we knew in summer league before the season that we had something special
3057262 if you look at his hands youll notice that theyre huge
3057263 now that were several weeks removed from the playoffs when you look back most of what sticks out in your mind is what dwyane did
3057264 think of the highlights of those two series what were the real playoff moments he hit the big shot in the first game of the new orleans series a basket with 1 3 seconds left that game miami their first playoff win in four years there was his big three at the end of the new orleans series and there was the dunk over jermaine oneal those are the plays that stick out
3057265 heres the thing about ron artest hes coming for blood
3057266 the only way to deal with it is to attack him first i look up and see the defensive player of the year in front of me i have to attack or else im not going to survive
3057267 but thats who i am i have an attack mindset i grew up getting beat on by my brothers and my dad playing ball in the backyard i had to attack then to survive when i would play at places like foster park in chicago i had to be on the attack then to survive and i still have attack to survive now
3057268 dwyane wade plays tough he does whatever there are a few guys in the league like that but not many
3057269 ive seen dwyane up close day in and day out
3057270 hes an attacker hes unstoppable he does like mj stuff our team last season before he got here was so much more deliberate this year just having him on the floor made us a more up tempo team because we had d at the point in my mind you can make the argument that he was the best rookie in the draft because he was the last rookie standing and we were 20 wins better
3057271 like we used to do with michael were trying to add a different weapon to dwyanes game every summer
3057272 this summer were trying to develop a one dribble two dribble pull up jump shot to dwyanes arsenal and were trying to add upper body strength so that he can shoot with greater consistency from distance
3057273 he reminds me of michael in the sense that dwyanes just as explosive and they both had such great change of direction speed it took michael four or five years to realize how important this offseason work is and dwyanes just realizing it now so hes ahead of the game dwyane doesnt necessarily like the workouts but nobody does trust me hed rather be spending this time playing ball but that never effects his intensity ever
3057274 when im not playing im either sleeping or playing with my son
3057275 the most important thing to me is that i set a good example for my son
3057276 he could have just come from robbing a bank but hes always got that same school boy look on his face he doesnt ever curse or anything like that its when he steps onto the court that he turns into a monster
3057277 the closest thing ive ever had to a nickname is d wade
3057278 its not a burden its a responsibility everyone who backed out has his own opinion and reason why hes not going to be there and thats fine but i wanted to go i want to wear the red white and blue im proud to represent my country and i think that if we come back with the gold medal there are going to be a lot of jealous guys who wished that hey had gone
3057279 this is something i want i want to get my face out there i want to do magazines and tv shows i think that i can appeal to different crowds i want to market myself
3057280 on the court i have no fear everyone on a basketball court is a man and you cant ever be afraid of another man the only other fear that i have is in life dying or having everything taken away from me before i get to finish what god has planned for me and i feel like he has a lot more in store
3057281 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3057282 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3057283 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3057284 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3057285 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3057286 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3057287 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3057288 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3057300 in general the company releases a new service or version once every several months
3057301 this is when we can do a marketing and pr push between those releases the blog is an effective tool to keep in touch with the market for instance during the first week of august three articles from the quintura blog were featured on the techmeme homepage as a result weve welcomed new blog readers as well as new web publishers who were interested in our product the quintura site search
3057302 my advice for start ups would be to select a segment and write regularly about news in that segment make sure it could be of interest for the industry and not only for company observers the stories must be relevant for a wide business audience
3057303 some major tech blogs regularly elaborate on the stories that were first posted on the quintura blog
3057304 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3057305 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3057306 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3057307 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3057308 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3057309 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3057310 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3057311 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3057312 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3057313 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3057314 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3057315 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3057316 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3057317 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3057318 he doesnt have to go out there and practice today or tomorrow and be percy he has to be percy when we play hawaii we know hes going to do that theres no reason to push him back hell be ready to go
3057319 when he comes back hes going to be something to see
3057320 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3057321 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3057322 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3057323 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3057324 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3057325 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3057326 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3057327 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3057328 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3057329 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3057330 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3057331 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3057332 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3057333 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3057334 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3057335 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3057336 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3057337 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3057338 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3057339 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3057340 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3057341 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3057342 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3057343 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3057344 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3057345 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3057346 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3057347 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3057348 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3057349 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3057350 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3057351 hopefully the new owners will make some improvements and it will sell for market value or more
3057352 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3057353 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3057354 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3057355 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3057356 i figured i would take a break and write a little something about ebisu since i had dinner there last night with a good friend and catching
3057357 i felt cozy even though it is pretty big place
3057358 this place is very reasonable w traditional quality as okina on arguello and yos sushi club on mission
3057359 sammys smoke amp snacks made a great lunch sandwich for me today
3057360 why didnt anyone tell me my ass was so big
3057361 do i the have hard currency to cover my order
3057362 my dad is a big time meat eater so naturally when he comes to visit i take the liberty of finding him damn good steak house for dinner
3057363 using massive quantities of mexican food to cure my hangover
3057364 hey were home youre going out to dinner with us tonight
3057365 fine gimme a shot of tequila because i need to get my buzz on
3057366 i damn sure hope its freakin homemade especially if it looks like that
3057367 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3057368 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3057369 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3057370 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3057371 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3057372 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3057373 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3057374 who are open to doing something on the production side
3057375 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3057376 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3057377 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3057378 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3057379 we recorded the highest quarterly sales and net income in u s steels history during the second quarter as all three reportable segments posted record results reflecting strong operating performance and favorable global pricing dynamics
3057380 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3057381 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3057382 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3057383 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3057384 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3057385 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3057386 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3057387 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3057388 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3057389 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3057390 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3057391 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3057392 good pakistan pakistans ruling coalition said thursday it would seek the impeachment of president pervez musharraf alleging the u
3057393 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3057394 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

3057399 the advocates of centrally managed economies moved with surprising alacrity to align themselves with the welfare state social democrats
3057400 they have failed to emphasize sufficiently and to examine the implications of the fact that liberty carries with it responsibility and it seems evident that many persons do not want to shoulder the final responsibility for their own actions many are indeed afraid to be free

3057415 i received an email from yelp today notifying me that pacific dental spa has filed a complaint against my review i am astounded that they are monitoring the discussion boards and would dispute a patients experience
3057416 i went to see dr kogan last week and he recommended over 2000 worth of dental work something in his tone demeanor roused my suspicion so i got a second opinion today it turns out theres nothing wrong with my teeth he misread the xray mistook stains for cavities and recommended a completely wrong course of treatment for a gap in my teeth scary i am going to contact the state board and let them know of my experience
3057417 how can they afford this self beware expensive unnecessary treatments

3057434 washington is out to deny china east land access to either russia the middle east or to the oil and gas fields of the caspian sea
3057435 a close look at the map of eurasia begins to suggest what is so vital for china and therefore for washingtons future domination of eurasia the goal is not only strategic encirclement of russia through a series of nato bases ranging from camp bond steel in kosovo to poland to georgia possibly ukraine and white russia which would enable nato to control energy ties between russia and the european union
3057436 washington policy now encompasses a series of democratic or soft coup projects which would strategically cut china off from access to the vital oil and gas reserves of the caspian including kazakhstan the earlier asian great silk road trade routes went through tashkent in uzbekistan and almaty in kazakhstan for geographically obvious reasons in a region surrounded by major mountain ranges geopolitical control of uzbekistan kyrgyzstan kazakhstan would enable control of any potential pipeline routes between china and central asia just as the encirclement of russia controls pipeline and other ties between it and western europe china india and the mideast
3057437 eurasia is the worlds axial super continent a power that dominated eurasia would exercise decisive influence over two of the worlds three most economically productive regions western europe and east asia a glance at the map also suggests that a country dominant in eurasia would almost automatically control the middle east and africa with eurasia now serving as the decisive geopolitical chessboard it no longer suffices to fashion one policy for europe and another for asia eurasia accounts for 75 of the worlds population 60 of its gnp and 75 of its energy resources collectively eurasias potential power overshadows even americas

3057487 it was so sad to hear about isaac hayes so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best god bless
3057488 three time grammy winner isaac hayes was a singer songwriter producer session musician actor activist and more his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present our deepest sympathies go out to his family friends and all who were inspired by the man and his music
3057489 i am shocked we have lost not only an incredible talent but a wonderful leader to his community and a dear friend to me there will only be one isaac hayes gifting us with years of performing writing and a voice that penetrated deep into our souls he is to be admired for changing his life around and standing steadfast to his beliefs his integrity and to helping others isaac you will be missed but never forgotten
3057490 isaac was one of the more genuine and beautiful souls i have had the privilege to cross paths with and befriend in this life he was an incredible friend this is a tragic loss my heart goes out to his wife and children wherever he is going to just became a brighter and more beautiful place and i will miss him dearly

3057590 she has played about every minute of every game for the last three seasons and is extremely consistent in practice and in game situations her consistent play and leadership will be a key to this teams success
3057591 in the past six months we have put a lot of time into changing the culture with this program now its time to focus on playing some good soccer as coaches what we enjoy most is developing these players and preparing them for competition on the field i expect this team to be competitive and fun to watch
3057592 a good non conference schedule should prepare your team for the high level of competition in the big 12 conference
3057593 i believe its a series we can win and that starts this season in norman

3057603 a top state department official with intimate knowledge of holbrookes activities has confirmed that the ambassador explicitly assured karadzic that he would not be arrested a concession known to several others at the state department who have remained silent
3057604 sometimes arrest operations were halted by chirac personally or other times by clinton
3057605 it was feared that his arrest would destabilize the situation after the dayton agreements

3057614 the majority of the cancer patients in this country die because of chemotherapy which does not cure breast colon or lung cancer this has been documented for over a decade and nevertheless doctors still utilize chemotherapy to fight these tumors
3057615 if i were to contract cancer i would never turn to a certain standard for the therapy of this disease cancer patients who stay away from these centers have some chance to make it
3057616 government leaders have continuously prided themselves of having achieved racial and religious harmony in the country
3057617 it was their favourite slogan during the 50 years of independence celebrations but the inability to hold dialogues about religious issues to find durable solutions only shows that the nation is split along racial and religious lines
3057618 i said dont do it openly if one still proceeds to do so it will certainly cause strong reactions
3057619 we live in a multi cultural society in which people of different backgrounds are able to coexist peacefully this is because we have been tolerant and respectful of the sensitivities of different races
3057620 they seem to have ignored the fact that the bar council has already clarified that the forum was to address the conflicts of law
3057621 they should have come out with their proposals in addressing the issue of non muslim husbands who abandon their spouses and their families and convert into islam rather than to stop a legitimate forum
3057622 many who had converted were also in a dilemma as they were unable to revert to their former religion
3057623 such issues and procedures if left unresolved without good mutual understanding will continue to haunt the multi religious society of malaysia there will be controversy and even conflicts over family matters related to religious conversion
3057624 we should be aware of sensitivities about religions by all respective believers therefore all politicians must take a rational and reasonable approach to look at how to fine tune the relevant laws and procedures to avoid or minimise potential inter religious controversies and conflicts
3057625 you have over 300 protesters behaving aggressively carrying inciting banners and storming into the bar council forum raising uncalled for racial sentiments against fellow non malay malaysians without fear and protected by the royal police force
3057626 there is no actual racial issue in malaysia it is only incited and seeded into the public to create a scenario that best serves an authoritarian state to serve its own agenda against the goodwill and humanity for the malaysian society that have co existed irrespective of their colour race religion and creed

3057635 a young man from the midwest whose business was thriving before prohibition was determined to succeed
3057636 his savings were dwindling quickly cash was needed fast so he turned to the richest most powerful figure in the history of american booze and asked for an infusion of money
3057637 so how did capone filter the money to his booze producing buddy
3057638 there capones partner owned a beautiful fourteen room villa with a gatehouse and 300 feet of water frontage in an enclave of waterfront homes in biscayne bay just minutes from miami beach
3057639 it was the perfect place for a gangster from chicago to safely
3057640 not only did it survive thanks to capones covert cash infusion
3057641 it still operates today churning out booze by the thousands of gallons following capones business model perfectly it caters to a market that doesnt rise or fall depending on the economy in fact this business does particularly well when times are tough
3057642 and its about to make a handful of investors very rich
3057643 amid the toughest markets in decades capones forgotten booze business is paying out a non stop river of cash to investors
3057644 its no wonder the worlds best investor is a major shareholder he understands capones recipe for success too his holdings are worth an estimated 2 billion and he receives annual payouts of over 45 million

3057653 unfortunately the trial court incorrectly held that trademark holders and not ebay are responsible for policing the ebay site the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3057654 ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3057655 not unsympathetic to tiffany and other rights owners who have invested enormous resources in developing their brands only to see them illicitly and efficiently exploited by others on the internet
3057656 the law is clear it is the trademark owners burden to police its mark

3057691 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3057692 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3057693 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3057694 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3057695 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
3057696 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
3057697 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
3057698 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
3057699 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
3057700 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3057701 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals

3057703 many enterprises are saddled with legacy installments like vantive which do not meet current business needs or it infrastructure standards and have been all but abandoned by their vendor in this case vantive was acquired by peoplesoft then peoplesoft was acquired by oracle leaving existing vantive users in a tough spot

3057716 mobile phones are without question the most underutilized computing platform in the world
3057717 despite the fact that billions of phones are able to run applications industry research shows that less than 5 percent of mobile subscribers around the world are actually running third party applications on their phones cascada mobile believes there are two main reasons why this number is so low first that conditions for mobile application development are a huge challenge limiting the number of mobile developers and applications and second that there are few resources for finding applications that are of interest to subscribers the breeze platform and breeze apps portal solve both halves of this mobile application problem
3057718 to get a strong picture of what was going on

3057720 no country of the former soviet union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than georgia

3057748 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt message between now amp the conv tell everyone to text vp to 62262 to be the first to know please forward
3057749 the number of offices that obama will be able to open in states where we essentially withdrew from the battlefields in previous campaigns is stunning
3057750 we are going door to door neighbor to neighbor to ensure people know barack obamas vision for our country and that they are engaged in the political process
3057751 were very honored that mr obama mentioned us and has eaten here in the past
3057752 it the platform is really something sen obama can run on and the rest of us can run on
3057753 today we pledge a return to core moral principles like stewardship service to others personal responsibility shared sacrifice and a fair shot for all
3057754 today we democrats offer leaders from the white house to the statehouse worthy of this countrys trust
3057755 commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
3057756 if you have ideals and want to accomplish things youve got to be pragmatic about it
3057757 hes never known anything else here in hawaii the proportion of women working outside the home has always been high
3057758 theyre not pretentious his grandmothers lived in the same two bedroom apartment for 40 years they never drove fancy cars they chose to put their resources into education and travel their success was based on intellect and hard work grandparents who sacrificed its the american story
3057759 the work ethic she gave me was if you want to get ahead you work hard and you work wise
3057760 he had only to observe his mother in her life actions to see that here was someone who believed she could change the world by her individual acts whether it was marrying his father or trying to help poor women free themselves from the bondage of centuries
3057761 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
3057762 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3057763 the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate
3057764 when i told people i was going out to utah i got a similar question if there are any democrats in utah and i said you know there are more than you think
3057765 weve seen it happen in colorado montana is getting close
3057766 we might not make it there this november in utah but together we can get there
3057767 utah deserves to have a voice just as much as california and new york
3057768 this is probably the single most historic event in my lifetime not only for us as a country but as a state
3057769 it wasnt a political speech it was from the heart
3057770 when we first drove out here we were told we should organize the three democrats out here and make sure we get all three of them
3057771 but as weve come here weve noticed there are a lot of republicans who want permission to vote for obama and a lot of people who are very upset with the way the countrys going
3057772 the strength of this they know who they are they know what the local issues are they know the local things going on so they can speak to their fellow voters and also in a sense be almost character witnesses for sen obama and build support that way
3057773 today is the day that we say welcome home to barack obama
3057774 i try to explain to them something about the aloha spirit i try to explain to them this basic idea that we all have obligations to each other that were not alone that if we see somebody whos in need we should help
3057775 most importantly that when you come from hawaii you start understanding that whats on the surface what people look like that doesnt determine who they are
3057776 and that the power and strength of diversity the ability of people from everywhere whether theyre black or white whether theyre japanese american or korean american or filipino american or whatever they are they are just americans that all of us can work together and all of us can join together to create a better country
3057777 its that spirit that im absolutely convinced is what america is looking for right now
3057778 i might go to zippys i might go to rainbow drive in i havent decided yet
3057779 im going to get some shave ice im going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location
3057780 welcome to hawaii event where barack will talk about his vision for bringing america together and creating the kind of change we can believe in
3057781 i think it is safe to assume there will be thousands
3057782 ive never been so excited about a candidate in my life
3057783 thats the nature of the job ive been going pretty much straight for 18 months now so were going to take the time
3057784 so its been about 19 months since i saw her
3057785 shes at an age where its really important for me to see her
3057786 and so does michelle i think so were going to take the time
3057787 if you think im going to throw my white sox under the bus because im here in minnesota thats not going to happen
3057788 its probably better that way they were a very nice group everyone was very polite we didnt have any problems with any of them
3057789 theres been an incredible outpour of requests for credentials in colorado
3057790 just to be a part of something like this is a no brainer its something id definitely like to be part of
3057791 the obama campaign has wasted no time in georgia launching massive voter registration drives before the primaries had even ended
3057792 if barack has the distinct honor of serving as your president and i have the privilege of serving as your first lady im going to keep taking your stories to him because the commander in chief doesnt just need to know how to lead the military he needs to understand what war does to military families and what he can do to make their lives better
3057793 it takes ingenuity to meet them but we have that
3057794 want a government thats accountable to you or to the special interests
3057795 his approach to the issues of race and diversity is so incredibly real honest and compassionate
3057796 i too have family and friends whose nbsp perspectives i disagree with but that doesnt mean i dont care about them it was an incredibly powerful speech that gave serious insight into senator obamas character wow
3057797 we can do better and with barack obama as president we will
3057798 i think the people believe that obama is their best chance for a change
3057799 what he failed to mention is he was there for 26 of those 30 years
3057800 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
3057801 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 its like these guys take pride in being ignorant you know they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true
3057802 because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
3057803 i was really happy he came to a small town like this
3057804 you dont have to be a delegate or a party insider to witness this historic moment firsthand
3057805 i want to be held accountable if i am fortunate enough if i have the honor to serve as your president then youre still going to have to watch out youve still got to make sure that im going to do what i said i was going to do because thats how our democracys supposed to work
3057806 its my first election and its a really big one
3057807 were welcoming everyone under our broad tent as weve always called it
3057808 its been republican territory here for some time but the democratic party is out registering republicans here lately
3057809 it is one of the most dangerous issues we face
3057810 to harness american energy and create five million new american jobs
3057811 the best part about so many voices calling in the room is so many different stories about how this campaign embodies the change that we crave there were 16 year olds talking about social security and seniors talking about education so many have talked about their neighbors who are squeezed by our struggling economy many speak of a war that could have should have never been waged and a constant theme is the shared disappointment in a broken political system in washington dc
3057812 fifteen years ago today working families everywhere achieved a victory when the family and medical leave act went into effect this groundbreaking law helps guarantee that americas workers shouldnt have to choose between their jobs or their health and the health of their families
3057813 because of the fmla more than eighty million people have been able to take needed time off work to care for themselves or family members
3057814 and because millions of people a year who are covered by fmla cant afford to take the time to which theyre entitled ill assist states in adopting paid leave systems strengthening the family and medical leave act wont just benefit employers or workers it will help put the american dream within reach for hardworking families
3057815 i know how much the auto industry and the autoworkers of this state have struggled over the last decade or so
3057816 but i also know where i want the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow to be built not in japan not in china but right here in the united states of america right here in the state of michigan
3057817 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
3057818 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
3057819 this will not be easy and it will not happen overnight
3057820 go around put up signs shake some hands see some of the important people in the village
3057821 the campaign is treating alaska as a key battleground state
3057822 its a tough state to move but were making a play
3057823 if theres any year where a democrat can win alaska this is the year
3057824 weve always voted up here just nobodys paid much attention
3057825 i dont remember that there ever was a real democratic campaign in christian county or that a presidential candidate opened an office here
3057826 times are a changing which can be attributed to more people moving into the county and young people are more aware of whats going on
3057827 its not going to be an easy task but theyll know were here in christian county
3057828 weve never had this happen now we can come in and ask questions and talk
3057829 its a gathering place for democrats to be together weve never even been able to afford an office for our christian county democrats
3057830 this campaign is more than barack obama its really about all of us coming together to solve problems
3057831 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
3057832 the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every persons vote
3057833 is the right position for the democratic party and for the country
3057834 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
3057835 while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process
3057836 the fact that virginia is even up for grabs tells you a lot
3057837 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
3057838 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
3057839 its a state that we have to win if barack obamas going to be president
3057840 youre going to see another round of office openings in the next couple weeks
3057841 there is no more effective messenger than someone you know someone you trust someone who lives next to you in your neighborhood
3057842 shaheen was a great governor its time to get her in the senate
3057843 weve got to get these democrats into office in new hampshire the state and this country needs them
3057844 in the past weeks we have moved quickly to put in place a leadership team that will build and manage the largest general election campaign in michigan history
3057845 as all of us know this volunteer neighborhood based person to person contact starting now will be the most important way we can properly introduce barack obama to voters
3057846 the climate has made millions of americans who havent been involved in a political campaign ever in their lifetimes very active
3057847 we estimate that 70 percent of our grass roots volunteers havent worked in a campaign before were somewhere just shy of 2 million volunteers and we think we can potentially triple that on election day
3057848 we think the turnout will be beyond record turnout and if were effective we will have done two additional things brought in millions of new people who are registered to vote and we will increase the percentage of registered voters who will turn out
3057849 this allows us to increase the volume of voters were talking to and have it be done with people who live in their community
3057850 people tend to believe information delivered by people they know and who live in their neighborhood more than an ad they see on television or what some third party from out of their state is telling them
3057851 you know that you cant take that seat at the front of the bus if you cant afford the bus fare you cant live in an integrated neighborhood if you cant afford the house and it doesnt mean a whole lot to sit down at that lunch counter if you cant afford the lunch
3057852 id be delighted to have you because i expect that in the next administration the white house will be the peoples house
3057853 people who do the work in america will never be invisible to the democratic party
3057854 under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again and is going to help grow the economy right here in brevard county
3057855 my commitment is to seamless transition where were utilizing the space station in an intelligent way and were preparing for the next generation of space travel
3057856 ive been working barack telling him its the i 4 corridor of florida that will make a difference
3057857 will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
3057858 can sometimes take us to far away from the reason that we support barack obamas candidacy i wanted us all to remember that we can make a difference in other peoples lives if we have the will to help
3057859 the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a simple question
3057860 if we want to create jobs we should do more to make work pay for ordinary americans
3057861 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
3057862 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
3057863 but we have to do more than just provide short term relief
3057864 we have to secure our long term prosperity and strengthen americas competitiveness in the 21st century
3057865 today we learned that 51 000 jobs were lost last month the seventh straight month of job loss now totaling 463 000 jobs lost since the beginning of this year
3057866 ive already called for an economic stimulus package on two different occasions this year and much of what ive proposed has passed in congress these efforts have made some difference but with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
3057867 a state like florida would get a disproportionate share because of its high foreclosure rate
3057868 this would simplify taxes for senior citizens provide real benefits and also work incentives
3057869 ordinary voters are tired of these swift boating attempts to bring out the negative side
3057870 it doesnt mean were going to win all those states but at least were making it a contest and giving voters something to choose from
3057871 virginia north carolina and georgia are all states where we are competitive
3057872 so far at least weve been successful in places that nobody guessed would be successful
3057873 we have a big map that were playing with thats no accident we said at the beginning of this campaign that one of the changes wed like to make in our politics was breaking out of this red blue state divide and going to places that maybe no one has gone to for a while and trying to make the case for change
3057874 we are going to have a presence all throughout the state with these offices were hitting a lot of these rural communities that were impacted by bushs economic policies
3057875 i was doing voter registration and it was on a big long street and we had a couple of stations set up
3057876 the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook
3057877 the straight talk express has taken a nasty turn into the gutter
3057878 with fewer than 100 days before election day senator mccain and his campaign have increasingly resorted to the low road
3057879 given our enormous challenges from energy and healthcare to our economic and foreign policy challenges the american people deserve a serious debate instead all weve been getting from the mccain campaign are misleading attacks and paris hilton and britney spears all of the time the mccain campaign spends attacking barack obama is time they are not focusing on helping american families meet the challenges of the 21st century
3057880 para impedir los ataques de las tropas georgianas contra osetia del sur y la reagrupaci n de sus unidades que participan en las acciones b licas contra osetia del sur
3057881 impedir la concentraci n de unidades de reservistas movilizados por el presidente georgiano mija l saakashvili para continuar los combates
3057882 it was the perfect time for us because of our situation where were at
3057883 i think today was one of those must win games and it was nice to pull this one out
3057884 its probably going to go down to the end i dont see us giving in i dont see those two teams giving in
3057885 were looking for a huge lift from him and so far weve gotten it
3057886 this is definitely not good news to see him leave the game
3057887 sunday was a prime example that were capable of doing it
3057888 i just got hit around thats all there is to it
3057889 every time i laugh or sneeze or cough or roll over its pretty uncomfortable
3057890 i kept my focus on what i was trying to do
3057891 wed rather play them at home then at their place
3057892 we need to put together a streak and hopefully we can go to minnesota and win that series
3057893 weve got to come out fighting and play with a lot of urgency
3057894 the easiest way to describe that game was we gave it away
3057895 were going to have to reach down and reach back its how you come back
3057896 not at all hes fine his hitting is going to come around
3057897 its good to have a guy like that on your staff
3057898 i felt it was a solid all around series for our ballclub
3057899 it starts with those starting pitchers giving us a chance to win the ballgame
3057900 its been a little difficult to get in a good groove especially today
3057901 i was trying to get back into the strike zone but i was unable
3057902 they score an awful lot of runs and if you make a mistake they dont foul it off they hit it
3057903 im just trying to make the adjustment from the bullpen to the starting rotation and getting a different mentality but i need to take a little bit of the pressure off myself and the way i think and just go after guys
3057904 my wife text messaged me after i got back in here and said youre trying too hard but thats always been my thing
3057905 felt good some at bats a little tardy on other ones
3057906 wed like to win all three on this 10 game homestand but its important we got the first one
3057907 after the game was over i told him welcome back
3057908 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
3057909 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks
3057910 we just won back to back series here at home were playing solid baseball
3057911 we can easily identify mistakes maybe in the strategy of the game the execution of a pitch here or there but i cant say that weve played inconsistent baseball
3057912 when we play well we can play with anyone thats when we dont make mistakes
3057913 zach keeps throwing like that hes going to be fine
3057914 bien la primera es que si me besas de nuevo creo que terminaremos consumando nuestro matrimonio aqu esta noche
3057915 i fallet med barack obama och hillary clinton har sociala tj nster skapat ett nytt slagf lt d r de nya kanalerna kan inneb ra en slags social krigsf ring som uppenbarligen kan vara v ldigt effektiv
3057916 trujillanos fc es ahora parte de un proyecto integral para el estado trujillo estamos iniciando un proyecto de envergadura de hoy en adelante acuerdo que se haga con un jugador es acuerdo que vamos a cumplir para que puedan trabajar dignamente
3057917 tenemos la esperanza de subir en las primeras de cambio y haremos el esfuerzo que tengamos que hacer trabajaremos con incentivos importantes que debe tener el jugador y haremos adem s un estudio social de cada uno para tener claras sus necesidades
3057918 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3057919 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3057920 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody
3057921 hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife
3057922 the thought really entered my mind for a split second
3057923 i thought thats ridiculous im at the olympic games im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts im going after it
3057924 i was pounding on the block saying the f word
3057925 i could see in his face the pain of losing like that
3057926 people always step up and do things out of the ordinary at the olympics
3057927 id just run out of steam i did my best to be ready for the week but clearly im not
3057928 i just couldnt get off the golf course fast enough i was probably the only guy who finished bogey bogey and thought he was doing pretty well
3057929 the back nine was unbelievable he holed some fantastic putts and you have to do those things to win majors he has gone well beyond and he is one of the top players in the world hes just a great unbelievable pressure player under the crush he is just extremely good
3057930 i felt an edge in terms of my ability to take an opportunity when it comes around
3057931 but who knows last round of a major you dont know i keep approaching every shot hopeful it will click into place
3057932 i knew i had the opportunity to get the putt in first
3057933 and that was important i knew if i holed this i probably would win the pga
3057934 i know i love the idea of the back nine of a major on sunday
3057935 i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major and i dont know what im going to do
3057936 dont leeve dem wii will foster dem for 30 daiz
3057937 he has the good fortune not to look like me
3057938 there were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded
3057939 prince william is not an institution nor a soap star nor a football hero
3057940 he is a child in the next few years perhaps the most important and sometimes painful of his life he will grow up and become a man
3057941 i want them to have an understanding of peoples emotions of peoples insecurities of peoples distress of their hopes and dreams
3057942 women may not be as likely to stray when spouses are ill
3057943 infidelity mostly a male problem though women can be guilty of this as well hurts women
3057944 im an exact duplicate of god when god looks in the mirror he sees me when i look in the mirror i see god oh hallelujah you know sometimes people say to me when theyre mad and want to put me down you just think youre a little god thank you hallelujah you got that right whod you think you are jesus yep are you listening to me are you kids running around here acting like gods why not god told me to since im an exact duplicate of god im going to act like god
3057945 i say ye are gods nevertheless you will die as mere men
3057946 how long do we have to put up with you unbelievers
3057947 the company could declare force majeure on its exports from the two ports
3057948 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3057949 i think we look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3057950 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
3057951 who knows him best who identifies with his values and vision who is his partner is his champion and will be an extraordinary leader of the discussion on monday night
3057952 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
3057953 highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation
3057954 the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need
3057955 barack obama is a leader to move america in a new direction and bring us together to turn moments of great challenge into moments of great opportunity this years democratic convention is the story of people from across the country who believe it is time for change
3057956 se ha producido la llegada de cinco cayucos muy seguidas pero con un n mero reducido de personas 61 67 62 84 y 61 en comparaci n con a os anteriores ya que llegaban m s de cien en cada embarcaci n situando la media entre ochenta o noventa inmigrantes por cayuco
3057957 la realidad es que ha habido m ltiples maneras para dirigir al lugar equivocado a los internautas y esta es una m s
3057958 when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that should be something protected at the core of the first amendment
3057959 if you are truthfully telling the world about a dangerous situation and it is a situation which is dangerous not because the security researcher exposes the vulnerability but because the person who made the product made the vulnerability then this should be core speech
3057960 we are going to be looking for at least 17 points if we are going to qualify
3057961 hopefully if we all work together we can make this vision happen and take the country to south africa
3057962 with northern ireland you have one eye on macedonia whats your starting line up
3057963 its going to be an important game hopefully they can show the form they showed in previous games and take that on
3057964 they showed against england when they drew at old trafford 0 0 that they are an excellent international side
3057965 but we have got to get our own game going our strength our teamwork our passion our belief and our never say die attitude
3057966 if we can keep that going we will be a very difficult team to beat
3057967 their all round ability their squad and their team play is fantastic
3057968 but you dont win games on paper just because you are favourites does not mean you will win and we will not fear anybody
3057969 i was elected to create a culture of integrity at the cabinet and throughout state government and we are making substantive progress toward that goal
3057970 we need to stop hostility we dont need further military action we need to stop it we need to bring back peace and a cease fire is about both sides
3057971 that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
3057972 the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe those days are gone
3057973 hamar garib aur nirdosh beta ke galti saja milal my poor and innocent son has wrongly been sentenced in the case
3057974 sachin tendulkar was a big part of their batting line up they do bank a lot on sachin rahul and probably sourav we knew that those guys in the middle had to be controlled somehow
3057975 virender sehwag is really batting well but he plays a different game all together those three guys are the ones who actually take the innings along and built on big innings and take the game away from you
3057976 we had lot of discussions on how to do it we attacked them from the game one we did not let them get to any easy start we put lot of pressure on them we bowled to good areas we bowled to certain plans we had that probably was the difference
3057977 shooting is 99 per cent luck and one per cent training
3057978 it is the result of hard and dedicated work and the blessings of god were also with them
3057979 all the talk about market touching its bottom is not really helpful as nobody knows where that is not many know where to sell and where to buy nobody knows where the bottom is
3057980 diversification is key we are currently neutral on equities and underweight on debt investors can take exposure to gold through exchange traded funds or buying shares of gold mining companies real estate can also be given a second look special offerings that seek to invest in private equity are also recommended but obviously with a longer investment horizon
3057981 inflation has not peaked out yet in a month or so inflation might go up to 12 5 13 per cent but by the end of this fiscal year it might be around 8 per cent that is above the central banks expectations
3057982 gigantic older problems of persistent deprivation of human lives tolerated without much political protest
3057983 justice demands that we make a strong effort to identify the overwhelming priorities that have to be confronted with total urgency
3057984 we have to ask what should keep us awake at night

3058034 i live in a semirural area where people are paid lower than average and the level of education is lower some clients just dont understand the value of an intangible such as financial advice and a properly prepared tax return
3058035 because it is part of my mantra to get paid most of the time i do
3058036 clients also appreciate that a clock is not ticking with important questions they have and so they do not hesitate to raise those questions with me
3058037 i then act as a coordinator of their various needs this puts me in the seat of helping them avoid pitfalls as well as allowing me to be in the position to see opportunities for them that might also be opportunities for compensation for me all fully disclosed

3058055 a one off crackdown is all very well but labour are still failing to enforce the knife laws we already have
3058056 they talk tough about increasing penalties but in the last five years for which figures are available not a single person has been sent to prison for selling knives to children
3058057 ministers must ensure that those caught in future are given more than just the pathetic fines seen in recent years

3058075 there are a lot of coming of age themes in headlocked the story is just as much about hartmann becoming a man as it is about him becoming a wrestler hes a nineteen year old college kid who has given up his relatively safe existence to chase this crazy dream and at the same time hes almost totally reinventing who he is from the ground up and hes doing this while navigating through the darker underbelly of the wrestling business as a total outsider
3058076 hartmann has just moved to philadelphia having secured a tryout with the legendary leo

3058199 its critically important that local authorities and the scottish government work together to overcome the shortage of affordable rented housing i am delighted that edinburgh council has signalled it will build 1100 new council houses i hope that other local authorities will follow suit
3058200 the scottish government could help local authorities by simplifying the planning system to tackle the blockages which delay house building across the country
3058201 while i welcome extra cash for dental services lets keep this investment in perspective the overall health and wellbeing budget is 23 935 7 million so 75 million for dental services is a comparatively modest cash injection for this vital service
3058202 im concerned at the relatively low priority given by the scottish government to training and teaching
3058203 liberal democrats share the concerns of victim support agencies that vulnerable witnesses and victims of crime are not receiving adequate support during the judicial process

3058205 the eu proposal for an eight hour journey time restriction if adopted would have a devastating impact on scottish livestock production
3058206 the commission seem to have no understanding of the distances involved and the time required to transport animals off islands like orkney and shetland to their market places
3058207 many farmers i spoke to at voe show in shetland believe that the consultation is a sham and that the commission have already made up their minds to introduce legislation to reduce journey times
3058208 liberal democrats believe that it is essential to tackle red tape which is too often a frustrating barrier to business development and a deterrent to new business the report of the regulatory review group set up by the previous scottish executive is therefore very welcome

3058210 i am extremely concerned to hear gps fears that removing health visitors from their practices will compromise patient safety
3058211 i wish all the new doctors starting work today across scotland every success
3058212 given the european working time directive is due to come into force next year i am concerned that over half the junior doctors in scotland are exceeding the specified hours health boards have had over eight years to prepare but i am not convinced that they will be ready in time
3058213 it is unacceptable that many of the junior doctors starting work today could start their career by contravening the ewtd and compromising patient safety
3058214 the clock has less than a year to go before health boards must meet the ewtd

3058218 psi focuses the majority of its resources and logistical infrastructure in the regions and countries where it is possible to enroll a larger number of patients per site
3058219 with the recent acquisition of thywill a well established latin american cro psi has expanded its coverage of the globe by entering another region with high enrolling potential
3058220 psis pragmatic model is to recruit the majority of patients from central and eastern europe and latin america while managing key opinion leader sites in western europe and the u s through experience with numerous global trials psi knows that high enrolling regions contribute between 80 to 90 of patients in a large trial while the row rest of world contributes 10 to 20 of patients psi continues to grow in a way that supports todays reality of clinical enrollment patterns

3058223 sure enough we looked in the bin and found this baby that had been murdered i was reduced to tears
3058224 she was very traumatised by the attack and then obviously stressed by the rescue but she is in the hospital now and doing really well so is her little baby

3058226 this gang has been pinning cane toads to trees and on another occasion they nailed several live magpies to trees
3058227 this is very disturbing and we cannot tolerate it this is one of the worst cases i have seen
3058228 it appears we are looking at a group of psychopathic thugs hoons that are just sickening people
3058229 this would definitely be classed at the extreme end of animal cruelty this is just a disgusting and unbelievable act
3058230 this is obviously something we take very seriously and we will assist the rspca in any way we can
3058231 on those occasions i normally sit them down and tell them about the beauty of koalas and they are fine i leave with the feeling they will not do it again
3058232 but in this case we are dealing with a group of men that started with magpies and toads and last week bashed to death a koala who knows what is next
3058233 koalas have more than enough problems with development cars and domesticated animals they dont need this sort of thing as well
3058234 giving only scotland a say on independence negates the existence of britain

3058256 one camp believes we should continue to focus 100 per cent of our attention on the few remaining issues for example this morning there are 7 open issues that will be fixed before the end of the day before we submit the software for certification on one of our platforms if the people working on those issues instead were working on a demo the whole process would take a little longer

3058260 i hold it the inalienable right of anybody to go to hell in his own way
3058261 apa saja musibah yang menimpa kamu maka disebabkan oleh perbuatan tanganmu sendiri dan allah memaafkan sebagian besar dari kesalahan kesalahanmu
3058262 tidak ada penyakit kesedihan dan bahaya yang menimpa seorang mukmin hinggga duri yang menusuknya melain kan allah akan mengampuni kesalahan kesalahannya dengan semua itu
3058263 kalau bukan karena musibah musibah yang kita alami di dunia niscaya kita akan datang di hari kiamat dalam keadaan pailit
3058264 dunia adalah penjara bagi orang mukmin dan surga bagi orang kafir
3058265 manusia pada hari kiamat menginginkan kulitnya dicabik cabik ketika di dunia karena iri melihat pahala orang orang yang tertimpa cobaan
3058266 wahai manusia si fulan hamba ku sakit dan engkau tidak membesuknya ingatlah seandainya engkau membesuknya niscaya engkau mendapati ku di sisinya
3058267 sesungguhnya besarnya pahala tergantung pada besarnya cobaan jika allah mencintai suatu kaum maka dia akan mengujinya dengan cobaan barang siapa yang ridha atas cobaan tersebut maka dia mendapat keridhaan allah dan barang siapa yang berkeluh kesah marah maka ia akan mendapat murka allah
3058268 sungguh menakjubkan kondisi seorang mukmin sesungguhnya semua urusannya adalah baik baginya jika memperoleh kelapangan lalu ia bersyukur maka itu adalah baik baginya dan jika ditimpa kesempitan lalu ia bersabar maka itupun baik baginya juga
3058269 allah menurunkan cobaan supaya hamba memanjatkan doa dengan sebab bala itu
3058270 dan apabila kami memberikan nikmat kepada manusia ia berpaling dan menjauhkan diri tetapi apabila ia ditimpa malapetaka maka ia banyak berdoa
3058271 ya rabbku sesungguhnya aku telah ditimpa penyakit dan engkau adalah yang maha penyayang di antara semua penyayang
3058272 ya allah tak ada lagi harapan untuk sembuhnya penyakit ini kecuali hanya kepada mu
3058273 barang siapa yang dikehen daki oleh allah kebaikan maka allah akan menimpakan musibah kepadanya
3058274 tidak seorangpun yang ditimpa bala pada jasadnya melainkan allah memerintah kan kepada para malaikat untuk menjaganya allah berfirman kepada malaikat itu
3058275 mengapa allah akan menyiksamu jika kamu bersyukur dan beriman dan allah adalah maha mensyukuri lagi maha menge tahui

3058319 the main benefits to us of the accubraille unit are that it will further shorten the supply time to get cartons to our customers and it will make it easier to maintain the quality of our braille embossing
3058320 accubraille is a revolution in applying braille embossing to cartons makeready is quick compared to a diecut amp emboss makeready or to the two makereadies needed if embossing as a separate run the rotary process is low impact so tools last much longer lower accubraille tools are universal which reduces external toolmaker costs only one embossing tool is required per job instead of one per blank station which cuts tooling costs even further and extra male tools can be made ready off machine while the previous job runs cutting makeready times
3058321 there has been lots of interest from our customers in the accubraille system and we are certainly leading the way on this were actively working through change procedures with key customers to bring it on stream for them
3058322 the launch of our accubraille which no other supplier can offer was the icing on the cake and made it clear the alpina ii line with accubraille and handypack gt packer would be the ideal purchase for medica to achieve their goals
3058323 having invested in additional print capacity in the form of a komori s40 last year we were in a position to release the latent capacity in the plant the alpina ii line is a key part of the strategy to meet our targets for organic growth

3058343 writing in the ieee spectrum james oberg analyzes whether there was in fact a significant risk to humans from the satellite which the us military shot down on 21 february purportedly to head off the possibility of its splashing a half ton of toxic hydrazine fuel somewhere on earth previous experts had scoffed at the rationale put forth pointing out that there was trivial possibility that any significant amount of toxic fuel would make it to the ground intact obergs analysis titled the inside story and claims that indeed its possible and even likely that there could be a danger to the ground unfortunately the analysis is full of flaws and lack of rigor indeed lacking any sort of numerical reasoning it seems to be too much repeating official spin and could have used a hefty dose of skepticism and could also use a little bit of actual analysis using numbers rather than handwaving
3058344 heres the first number that oberg should have quoted 32 megajoules per kilogram
3058345 the hydrazine tank is a 1 meter sphere containing about 400 liters of hydrazine the stated hazard area is about 2 hectares something like 1 10 000 000 000 of the area under the orbit

3058359 carlos came to us a year ago straight after the copa america
3058360 his fitness now is light years ahead of where it was then and we are expecting big things from him
3058361 the great thing about tevez is that he has a heart to play the game he is not intimidated at all he fights for every ball and is a real handful
3058362 the decision to make him man of the match was fully justified
3058363 it was a superb performance he was a constant thorn to portsmouth and it is just a pity he did not get a goal
3058364 we feel he owes us at least a season of loyalty
3058365 we took him from arsenal reserves and made him an international player
3058366 although we do accept from his point of view he has given us two years excellent service and it wasnt his fault that we were relegated we feel its not the right time to sell him from the clubs point of view we hope in due course he realises we are being entirely reasonable
3058367 we have the highest respect for him that is why weve offered him a new contract doubling his money despite the fact that hes got two years left on his existing contract and we have a two year option at the end of his existing contract
3058368 weve lost two of our big players in brad and david bentley and clubs are trying to unsettle some of my players
3058369 i dont like it but as far as im concerned and the chairman is concerned thats it now
3058370 all we want to do is re build and bring players in rather than lose players thats the situation
3058371 speaking to the chairman theres always been issues every year about clubs coming in for our players
3058372 that just shows what good players weve got at this club
3058373 but for me its my first job in the premier league and the last thing i want to do is sell my best players
3058374 benni is definitely one of them and theres plenty more as far as im concerned the situation is closed
3058375 theres always going to be speculation about players but i can categorically say 100 per cent that nobody will be leaving this club

3058380 mobile phones are without question the most underutilized computing platform in the world
3058381 despite the fact that billions of phones are able to run applications industry research shows that less than 5 percent of mobile subscribers around the world are actually running third party applications on their phones cascada mobile believes there are two main reasons why this number is so low first that conditions for mobile application development are a huge challenge limiting the number of mobile developers and applications and second that there are few resources for finding applications that are of interest to subscribers the breeze platform and breeze apps portal solve both halves of this mobile application problem

3058395 there are a lot of armchair detectives and instant experts out there formulating opinions not based on a full set of the facts the only airtight cases in life are on csi in prime time
3058396 a search of the computers may reveal documentary evidence that will assist the investigation into these threats to witnesses related to the anthrax investigation and obstruction of that investigation
3058397 we dont want this to be another lee harvey oswald case where the public says it is never solved to their satisfaction
3058398 somebody needs to finish the job that would have been finished in a court of law
3058399 this is devastating not only to usamriid but pretty much all government research
3058400 the implication is that usamriid cant be trusted to police itself
3058401 it may look bad for usamriid because of this case but at the same time usamriid was at the forefont of saving a lot of lives
3058402 it surely seems as though ivins was a troubled man and something should have picked this up earlier he should have been rescreened and re evaluated in terms of his ability to have the access that he had
3058403 well i was waiting on your call and i have called you a number of times
3058404 im sorry hes not here may i take a message
3058405 we open at 8 30 but he may be in at 9
3058406 i dont know i dont control when he comes into the office
3058407 well can you tell him to call me or are you not allowed to do that either
3058408 well i gave him 200 to start working on my case whine whine snivel snivel
3058409 so i just wanted to get his opinion on that
3058410 multieffetto lo porto indietro e me lo faccio cambiare ce la fai a tenerlo
3058411 e meglio se mentre andiamo lo tieni dietro al mio culo e intanto mi abbracci per tenerti
3058412 lui sta cercando un relitto di gibson flying v da pasticciare
3058413 why do you spend money for what is not bread and your wages for what does not satisfy
3058414 behold i have made him a witness to the peoples a leader and commander for the peoples
3058415 behold you will call a nation you do not know and a nation which knows you not will run to you because of the lord your god even the holy one of israel for he has glorified you
3058416 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways
3058417 for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
3058418 for as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there without watering the earth and making it bear and sprout and furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater 11 so shall my word be which goes forth from my mouth it shall not return to me empty without accomplishing what i desire and without succeeding in the matter for which i sent it
3058419 for you will go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills will break forth into shouts of joy before you and all the trees of the field will clap their hands
3058420 instead of the thorn bush the cypress will come up and instead of the nettle the myrtle will come up and it will be a memorial to the lord for an everlasting sign which will not be cut off
3058421 then the angel of the lord came and sat beneath the great tree at ophrah which belonged to joash of the clan of abiezer
3058422 if the lord is with us why has all this happened to us and where are all the miracles our ancestors told us about didnt they say the lord brought us up out of egypt but now the lord has abandoned us and handed us over to the midianites
3058423 how can i rescue israel my clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of manasseh and i am the least in my entire family
3058424 i will be with you and you will destroy the midianites as if you were fighting against one man
3058425 i need to know that you are going to use me to rescue israel im going to set out a piece of wool on the ground if its wet tomorrow and the ground is dry ill know youre telling me the truth
3058426 okay god heres the deal i need to be completely sure so were going to do the opposite this time i want the ground to be wet but the wool to be dry
3058427 god if this is what you want you need to make it completely clear
3058428 if i let you fight like this israel will think they did it with their own strength i need them to know it was all my doing tell those who are scared they can go home
3058429 you still have too many have your army gather at the river and take a drink whoever laps water like a dog they get to go home but whoever dips their hands in and drinks from their hands they can stay
3058430 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
3058431 this has been a difficult week and a half for us
3058432 we lost our family dogs we did it at the hands of sheriffs deputies who burst through our front door rifles blazing
3058433 i heard gunfire shoot off there was a brief pause and more gunfire
3058434 i noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood
3058435 she was literally in the kitchen cooking a lovely pasta dish and they brought down the door and shot our dogs
3058436 they didnt know my name all they knew was my wifes name they matched that to the registration of the car
3058437 it was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives
3058438 i didnt sign up for this fight but i think what we have to do now is make changes to how prince georges county police and prince georges county sheriffs department operate
3058439 the special operations team that supported us made a decision about the necessity of entry at the point of being on the scene
3058440 weve done these similar kinds of operations over and over again to the tune of removing billions of dollars of drugs from the community and without people or animals being harmed
3058441 we dont want any of our operations to result in the injury or loss of anybody and certainly not animals
3058442 i would say that the dogs presented a threat i would imagine to the special operations situation
3058443 because americas relations with a host of countries are intricately tied to fannie and freddie
3058444 americans future ability to gain access to credit if foreign companies and governments abandon united states investments home auto and credit card loans will be much more difficult to come by
3058445 trouble at fannie mae and freddie mac stirs concern abroad
3058446 if we get to a four degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
3058447 wiped from the face of the earth ten osettian villages
3058448 the scale of cynicism is surprising and the skill to present white as black and black the trick to present the aggressor as the victim of an aggression and to place the responsibly for the effects on the victims
3058449 it is lamentable that some of our partners are not helping us but are trying to stand in the way i mean among other things the transfer of the georgian military contingent from iraq actually to the conflict zone by the military transport planes of the united states
3058450 nobody was listening and this is the result we have finally come to it however russia will of course carry out its peacekeeping mission to its logical end
3058451 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3058452 georgia must fulfil two fundamental conditions withdraw all of its armed units to the border of the safety zone stipulated by the 1992 agreement and sign an agreement on the non use of force with south ossetia
3058453 place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity
3058454 b2 is a stable outlook and thats the way its going to stay for now
3058455 why is the hyper v wmi provider so difficult to use

3058460 summers almost over sad isnt it makes you want to i dont know reach out and hold it back
3058461 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
3058462 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
3058463 this should be a wholesome development for the us for it promises both political stability for the worlds largest country and continuing opportunities for the us to export to and invest in the worlds fastest growing economy

3058475 it translates into over 800 growth over a three year period
3058476 by offering a good value to our customers and with the help of our highly motivated distributor force weve been able to sustain our growth and build our network
3058477 our globalinx network and commercial product offerings have accelerated our growth enabling us to capture a greater share of revenue
3058478 every day were building on our total momentum and we expect to move up again on the list next year in 2008
3058479 it therefore eases the passing on of this vital information knowing your hiv status
3058480 i wrote many letters to the sdo to state that i am now prepared to taker over the paramount chieftaincy of limbe and that a meeting should be called the sdo called a meeting where people came and in fact everybody who came was of the agreement that i should be the chief but the sdo said he would send his recommendations to the governor
3058481 if the governor knew that i am not the one to be installed he would have given his reasons and not just sit quiet and leave matters to lie to the detriment of the country
3058482 so far there has been no clear case i am the only one the rest are just scheming
3058483 storey buildings could be erected to accommodate market stalls like it is done elsewhere
3058484 we have been used to this area and taking the market to molyko will make us lose our customers secondly there are no parking stores for us in molyko and the absence of houses at the site will give way for thieves to invade the market
3058485 the council was given temporal gratis occupancy for a period of six months beginning from march 1 2000 we have a lease agreement signed by the council and the authorities of coic
3058486 this is further compounded by the fact that there are no toilet facilities in the market so people usually leap into coic land to defecate
3058487 the issue of the great soppo market is dicey first the natives claim that the old site is their own land we wanted to build a bridge across the ravine to connect the market and the inhabitants of great soppo native and its environs but the council workers were chased away secondly the present market is an eyesore and more importantly the location is not good for it there is high risk of accidents vehicles losing control and rolling downhill we dont want to wait for a catastrophe to happen before we relocate the market
3058488 but unfortunately that has not been the case instead the returns have been further reduced but douala and yaounde have been upgraded worse still there is no fixed amount or time of remittance of the funds feicom can decide to give the council a miserly amount once or twice a year
3058489 there doesnt seem to be any land to cede because former administration officials misused land they either sold it shared it out to relations or gave it to big shots so the villagers dont seem to have any land to offer
3058490 we all know about close ties between the presidents of the two countries
3058491 ramones is either the last great modern record or the first great postmodern one
3058492 capture the full range of the ramones sound and stand as a sort of mini album within the album
3058493 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3058494 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3058495 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3058496 continued aggression against georgia and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond south ossetia will only serve to damage russias international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe
3058497 our business is based on people personalities and relationships the better the relationships the better the understanding cooperation and respect from everyone involved
3058498 enter into a dialogue with them on an individual basis
3058499 users of electronic communication can take up to four times as long to exchange the same number of messages as communicating face to face particularly as non verbal cues can account for up to 63 percent of the social meaning within face to face exchanges trust can be fragile because of behavioral invisibility when people cannot observe each other

3058614 dentro de las posibilidades que hab a el hajduk seguramente sea el rival m s dif cil porque su nombre nos suena y por la liga en la que juega pero si no somos capaces de eliminarle tampoco tendr amos mucho que hacer en la uefa no quiero ir a la uefa para visitar europa sino para hacer algo importante
3058615 tuvimos alg n problema que tambi n nos sirve de experiencia pero en general estuvimos bastante bien jugamos ante tres rivales buenos y vinimos bastante mejor de lo que fuimos el positivismo de la plantilla ha solucionado muchos problemas igual otros jugadores le hubieran buscado defectos
3058616 no es f cil preparar los entrenamientos con tanta gente a ver si poco a poco se van colocando no s c mo est n los temas porque dependen de tres partes pero los jugadores lo saben se est n moviendo y estamos esperando que se concrete
3058617 me gusta pensar en el club pero tambi n las personas en m xico hay un nuevo seleccionador sven goran eriksson y aunque es una pena que no est n en el teresa herrera en dos a os hay un mundial y querr n estar los dos van a estar para la uefa que es lo importante

3058673 a large chunk of western louisville and the shively area saw a 22 percent drop in median home prices in the first six months of this year by far the biggest decline of any neighborhood from a year earlier according to the greater louisville association of realtors
3058674 housing experts and community leaders blame the drop to 35 000 from 45 000 in the same period in 2007 at least in part on a large number of mortgage foreclosures in those areas along with a tight credit market that makes it tough for buyers to get financing
3058675 kennie romans who has worked as a real estate agent in the shively area for 49 years said the market is the worst hes seen
3058676 ive got some houses sitting around for a year or year and a half said romans 91 who is a former president of the local real estate association adding that his sales are almost down to nothing this year

3058681 kim the mortgage broker was one of my friends i actually told him that my first priority was to pay off a high interest credit card so i asked him to set up a mortgage that required the minimum amount of payment per month
3058682 vigeland and how long was the loan designated interest only kim actually i am not sure about this because i was kind of ignorant at the time and i wasnt really well educated as i am now but im thinking its five years
3058683 vigeland will you be able to afford the payments if you are not able to refinance before you have to start paying principal
3058684 kim well i am hoping that the housing market will get better and my house value will go up to the level where it was but i am not in a position where i have to foreclose or anything so im not too worried about that but i just dont like suffering for someone elses problems

3058700 a division of rescap the embattled mortgage finance arm of gmac financial services is fighting back in the home lending credit crisis
3058701 the bloomington based investor has filed more than a dozen federal lawsuits in minnesota against mortgage companies claiming that they failed to do adequate due diligence on borrowers and provided inaccurate information about the financial wherewithal of loan applicants
3058702 in its lawsuits rescap alleges that individual mortgage and finance companies made misrepresentations concerning borrowers employment income occupancy and other undisclosed liabilities the loans at issue range from 21 000 to more than 1 million
3058703 john koneck of fredrikson amp byron said lenders typically first pursue the borrower when a loan is in default and then discover that the mortgage was approved on less than perfect information from the applicant now lenders are turning their attention to the mortgage brokerages he said
3058704 rescap has filed 13 lawsuits against mortgage companies in federal court in minneapolis just this year up from a handful in previous years
3058705 im reluctant to say all the blame is on the lenders said brent lindahl a member of the mortgage banking group for a twin cities law firm
3058706 the prospect of litigation in the mortgage market prompted eden prairie based kroll ontrack to survey the attitudes of potential jurors to the home lending crisis lenders may not like the results nine out of 10 who were surveyed said they believe that lenders who issued subprime loans took risks and ignored more prudent lending practices
3058707 there arent too many people who have a positive view of the lending community said robert minick trial consultant with kroll ontrack
3058708 securities and real estate experts expect more lawsuits to come as the finger pointing among lenders brokers and investors gets ugly
3058709 was it the brokers who didnt do the due diligence

3058774 as we all know saddam hussein was hanged for burning down several shiite villages but now suddenly the situation is different the georgian leaders who in a matter of hours wiped out ten ossetian villages who ran over children and the elderly with tanks who burned civilians alive those people have to be protected
3058775 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding

3058791 we are looking at the files they are 20 or 23 of the former state governors i believe that in the next two weeks we will know which of them are to be investigated or not some of them are already being prosecuted for money laundering money laundering is not in our mandate
3058792 we are scrutinising the file to see whether there are cases that we could now pursue many of these allegations were committed as far back as 2003 we need to see which of these allegations are motivated for election purposes
3058793 for this category of people we dont need an independent counsel
3058794 the chief justice will study the allegations and consider whether it is worthwhile to appoint independent counsel to investigate those allegations when the independent counsel investigates he does not prosecute he reports to the legislature it is for the legislature to take over from there
3058795 as far as we are concerned nobody should feel offended if investigated it is what the laws say that we will do it is misconception to look at the status of a person and conclude that you are not going to investigate him ayoola also said that setting of special courts might not necessarily solve the problem associated with delay in the prosecution of corrupt related cases adding
3058796 i think it is unfair to keep a person under that kind of suspense but the challenge is for the court the case is still in court and we just have to wait for the system to perform
3058797 we are waiting for them to complete the exercise and whether the report is sent to us for prosecution or not we are going to ask for the transcript then through the transcript we will see how the system had permitted such things to happen
3058798 we want to see from the transcript where the system is faulty and then suggest reform and review of the system
3058799 we are going to use the energy probe as a real case study

3058816 die sozialdemokratische bildungsreform die kindern aus arbeiterinnenfamilien den zugang zu guter bildung erm glichte wurde vom langj hrigen unterrichtsminister dr fred sinowatz umgesetzt
3058817 bildung f r alle unabh ngig vom geldb rsel diese forderung ist heute genauso aktuell
3058818 fred sinowatz war ein mann des dialoges sein in der hainburg auseinandersetzung ausgerufener weihnachtsfriede hat eine der schwersten innenpolitischen krisen unseres landes gel st
3058819 er hat als unterrichtsminister einen wesentlichen beitrag f r den von bruno kreisky initiierten dialog zwischen kirchen und sozialdemokratie geleistet
3058820 das ist eine ganz wichtige verbesserung f r die pflegebed rftigen menschen und ihre angeh rigen dank der hartn ckigkeit der sp gibt es schon 2009 eine deutliche erh hung des pflegegelds und substanzielle verbesserungen f r demenzerkrankte sowie f r schwer behinderte kinder und jugendliche
3058821 sinowatz war einer der intellektuell redlichsten und aufmerksamsten menschen die mir in der politik je begegnet sind
3058822 ich verliere einen meiner engsten freunde mein tiefes mitgef hl gilt in dieser schweren stunde den hinterbliebenen
3058823 von krankheit gezeichnet aber von lebenswillen erf llt bis zum letzten tag seines wachen lebens an der entwicklung sterreichs teilgenommen und sein besonderes interesse f r die alterssicherung sowie f r leistbare pflege und betreuung bekundet
3058824 war mit seiner moralischen kraft eine gro e st tze
3058825 als vater der freien schulfahrt und der freien schulb cher hat fred sich schon zu lebzeiten ein denkmal gesetzt
3058826 a press release from pr office in ny that contains some not correct info
3058827 the press release is reporting that portion of 2003 vintage has been cleared while my report sent to ny was explaining that we are expecting some news on analysis within the next couple of weeks i am sorry for any misunderstanding i have created but it is due to my emotion and to a not clear report i sent to ny office
3058828 wir haben einen mann verloren der in seiner langen politischen laufbahn mehr f r sein heimatland und f r sterreich getan hat als ihm eine oft kurzatmige journalistische geschichtsschreibung zugesteht die von ihm als unterrichtsminister initiierten reformen pr gen die sterreichische bildungslandschaft bis heute vor allem wurde damit auf dem gebiet der bildung chancengleichheit verwirklicht als bundeskanzler hat er auch in f r ihn schwierigen situationen etwa bei der besetzung der hainburger au augenma und gr e bewiesen in unbedingter loyalit t setzte er sich stets f r sterreich ein sein tod ist ein schmerzlicher verlust
3058829 wir werden ihn als gro en und grundsatzfesten politiker und liebenswerten menschen in erinnerung behalten
3058830 fred sinowatz war trotz seiner exponierten politischen position ein ma voller und der schrillen tagesrhetorik abholder hochgebildeter repr sentant der sterreichischen politik im allgemeinen und der sozialdemokratie im besonderen w hrend seiner amtsf hrung als bundeskanzler war die sterreichische industrielandschaft ebenso von einigen gravierenden turbulenzen gepr gt wie die parteienlandschaft in innen und au enpolitischen angelegenheiten das drama hainburg wurde noch oben draufgesetzt sinowatz begegnete all diesen herausforderungen die mit wucht seine eigene person betrafen mit gelassenheit und berblick ich genoss das in meiner lebensgeschichte einmalige privileg amtsnachfolger der gro artigen pers nlichkeit fred sinowatz zu werden ich habe heute nicht nur den vorg nger als weisen gespr chspartner sondern auch den unvergesslichen freund verloren
3058831 nur einen tropfen auf dem hei en stein um die inflationsbedingten realen verluste beim pflegegeld nur auszugleichen ist eine erh hung von 10 prozent das mindeste
3058832 pflege muss leistbar qualit tsvoll und sicher sein rund 80 prozent der pflegebed rftigen menschen in ganz sterreich werden nach wie vor zu hause betreut und gepflegt damit aber die pflegebed rftigen menschen trotz vielf ltiger einschr nkungen ein relativ selbstst ndiges leben im eigenen haushalt f hren k nnen muss das pflegegeld entsprechend angehoben werden es muss daher eine einmalige erh hung des pflegegeldes um 10 prozent verbunden mit einer dauerhaften valorisierung umgehend durchgef hrt werden
3058833 jeder sterreicher hat das recht auf sichere und leistbare pflege auch ein pflegebed rftiger der zwar keine 24 stunden betreuung ben tigt hat reale kaufkraftverluste erlitten und ist auf hilfe angewiesen hier zwischen pflegebed rftigen zu differenzieren ist unsozial und ungerecht
3058834 mit fred sinowatz verliert unser land einen gro en bildungspolitiker und mitgestalter der f r sterreich so erfolgreichen kreisky ra unser mitgef hl geh rt seiner familie
3058835 diese zukunftsweisende bildungspolitik hat vielen menschen in unserem land neue chancen und eine positive zukunft gebracht
3058836 als mitte der 80er jahre die voest in schwere turbulenzen kam war er f hrend daran beteiligt das unternehmen auf gesunde beine zu stellen und den grundstein f r eine erfolgreiche zukunft zu legen
3058837 wir werden diesem bedeutenden politiker und menschen immer in ehren gedenken
3058838 mit ihm verliert sterreich nicht nur einen aufrechten patrioten und einen engagierten staatsmann sondern wir verlieren dar ber hinaus einen warmherzigen und liebensw rdigen menschen in allen seinen politischen funktionen als burgenl ndischer landtagsabgeordneter landtagspr sident und mitglied der landesregierung und sp ter in den 70er und fr hen 80er jahren als bundesminister f r unterricht und kunst als vizekanzler und schlie lich ab 1983 als bundeskanzler hat sich fred sinowatz mit ganzer kraft bem ht seinen mitmenschen zu dienen und zur verbesserung ihrer lebensumst nde beizutragen besonders engagiert war fred sinowatz als bildungs und kulturpolitiker dessen anliegen es war die chancengleichheit junger menschen durch gleichberechtigten zugang zu allen bildungseinrichtungen zu erm glichen und die freiheit der kunst zu f rdern als nachfolger bruno kreiskys stand er in den jahren 1983 1986 an der spitze der sterreichischen bundesregierung sein pflichtbewusstsein und sein lauterer charakter haben ihm weit ber die grenzen seiner politischen gesinnungsgemeinschaft hinaus im in und ausland respekt und anerkennung eingetragen ich pers nlich werde fred sinowatz mit dem ich seit mehr als 45 jahren eng befreundet gewesen und einen langen gemeinsamen weg gegangen bin immer aufrichtig verbunden bleiben

3058847 when you live in iran and you see all the frustrations of daily life you dream of leaving the country and your books and studies become a ticket to a better life

3058849 here our education is properly valued we are given freedom to succeed in iran we are blocked
3058850 look really good but these antennas are using the same materials as antennas i saw when i was a junior engineer 30 years ago
3058851 the new nanotechnology materials are awesome and the performance boost you can get is incredible
3058852 im trying to get people to think outside the box in antenna design
3058853 you wont get the benefits of ofdm if you dont have adequate backhaul
3058854 all the carriers are struggling with how to deal with this by increasing fibre or using microwave
3058855 next generation lte long term evolution and wimax networks are high throughput links that can send 100mbit s or more
3058856 you cant transmit that if you only have a backhaul of 4 to 5mbit s of the t1 lines typically going to these cell sites
3058857 two years ago i said lte will dominate through wimax could be big and convergence of the two technologies is a still the case
3058858 that blessing really established lte as the default network of choice and verizons planned move from cdma to lte was significant also
3058859 it will be lte and wimax and lte will be dominant
3058860 it costs many billions of dollars to make these upgrades so carriers need to balance the return on their investments against their competitive pressures
3058861 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now

3058890 i heard you yelling and i wasnt going to let go
3058891 deliberately and courageously exposed himself to enemy fire in order to prevent the enemy from assaulting through the kill zone and overwhelming his convoy
3058892 his selfless actions prevented the enemy from turning the tide of the battle and undoubtedly saved the lives of his soldiers

3058897 a really naive simple guy who doesnt know the first thing about jihad and was just tagging along for the job
3058898 several factors are inhibiting the revenue surge of the past 20 years
3058899 those factors include the statistical law of large numbers which makes it difficult for such a large market to expand much on a percentage basis other factors include a slowdown at leading ems provider foxconn shifting ems odm business models new oem procurement strategies and oem contract manufacturing asset transfers
3058900 as many of the larger contract manufacturing s attempt to retrench and right size their businesses revenue growth has become stagnant or even negative
3058901 because of this an examination of possible acquisition targets becomes a top priority for larger companies
3058902 simple manufacturing is an entry ticket but it wont get you anywhere
3058903 i dont think anybody is excited about winning low margin programs simply to fill capacity
3058904 i would say that manufacturing processes throughout the industry are stabilized and somewhat standardized differentiation will not result from being the best assembly house
3058905 we are happy to know that broadcom prevailed in two separate patent cases ruled by two different itc judges in favor of our position that sirf infringes our intellectual property ip and that we did not infringe their patents
3058906 before the itc trials we had been looking forward to cooperatively resolve the differences of the companies when everything turned out to be hopeless we have to take legal means to protect our ip rights we are keeping our lines open for a mutual resolution to these disputes
3058907 the foundation is also negotiating with state officials in andhra pradesh and rajasthan about building other solar power projects
3058908 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
3058909 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
3058910 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
3058911 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
3058912 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
3058913 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
3058914 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
3058915 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
3058916 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
3058917 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
3058918 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
3058919 based upon our extensive experience with modems and speech codecs we realized that we had the technology and understanding to develop a technical solution meeting the ecall requirements
3058920 oh we need more scenes to have a movie and lets put the only good one at the end

3058923 i traveled with harry reser and his cliquot club eskimos back in l936 through the mid west on a series of one nighters only the whole summer literally
3058924 harry why do where do people get the money to come hear us
3058925 you know jer they save their pennies for the weekend so they can get some beer and go out and pay whatever it costs to go to a dance with their wives or girlfriends have a ball forget about their trouble and then after its all over start all over again get that money back

3058935 i have not decided on a candidate i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3058936 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
3058937 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
3058938 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
3058939 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
3058940 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
3058941 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
3058942 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
3058943 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
3058944 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
3058945 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
3058946 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
3058947 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
3058948 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
3058949 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
3058950 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
3058951 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality
3058952 i think were living in one of the most active periods of web development right now
3058953 ive heard this rumour a couple of days ago somebody asked me that and that was the first id heard about it its incredibly flattering to be in a rumour i would do it in a second with those guys but do you think its a good idea to redo ghostbusters its a classic
3058954 raising them here is different because i was raised in new york city its totally different i grew up in the upper west side of manhattan in the 70s
3058955 there were fires and riots and serial killers it was great my kids its l a its sunny and nice they dont have any excitement
3058956 with ncrs advanced technology these machines will dispense a wide array of dvds and could offer digital downloading in the future all under the blockbuster brand
3058957 this initial rollout provides consumers increasingly convenient access to their favorite movies and is one more step in the fulfillment of our mission to transform blockbuster into a multi channel provider of media entertainment
3058958 this alliance with blockbuster is an exciting step for ncr as we pursue our mission of becoming the leader in the market for entertainment self service solutions
3058959 looking beyond this initial deployment our mutual goal is to have 10 000 kiosks installed within 18 months we are energized and thrilled to be such an integral part of blockbusters strategy for providing consumers with greater choice and convenience
3058960 there are some things that really disconcert me one is the constant comparisons to my mother
3058961 do they never think how sick that is its my dead mother and i dont want people writing about that its wrong and its hurtful to keep bringing it up
3058962 we wanted to extend our appreciation for all of the support and kind words we have received in the days since my fathers passing
3058963 he was an amazing man who lived and breathed kittie and he will be missed by many the next show at the key club in hollywood california on 20aug08 is the last one he booked so it is very important to us we all owe it to him to make it a good one regardless of how hard it is going to be please come out pay your respects
3058964 a few months ago i did a quick interview with entertainment tonight and i stuck my foot in my mouth and said that i was having twins by accident i begged them to edit that out as i wasnt ready for it to be out there then but when i was i would give it to them exclusively
3058965 they really could have ran with it but they said they would not they actually kept their word which i found so refreshing i couldnt believe it
3058966 i really want to thank them for that they are one of the last remaining entertainment news shows that has kept its dignity and high standards in the current morally degraded climate we are now in

3058971 i want to meet my boss i want to meet the president
3058972 i had my husband alive and in front of me
3058973 i could see his face and touch his skin he was real what more could i possibly ask for
3058974 the president says mom and the troops are doing such a good job and we need to stay here a little longer
3058975 do i feel bad about apologizing for the army hell no
3058976 troops in contact just north of checkpoint 30 on msr tampa
3058977 they set august 17 as deadline for the apology failing which the committee will call for a 24 hour general strike in manipur from august 19

3058981 my old car died the same day my mother did
3058982 more than 50 russian warplanes are flying over georgia the capital tbilisi was bombed bombs hit the village of kojori and makhata mountain
3058983 there was heavy firing all night with rockets and machine guns from the southern side of the city
3058984 the situation is very tense here this is a humanitarian catastrophe there is no water and the citys entire infrastructure is destroyed
3058985 this is completely unacceptable especially from the lips of a representative of a country whose actions we are aware of in iraq afghanistan and serbia
3058986 if georgia falls this will also mean the fall of the west in the entire former soviet union and beyond
3058987 given the sharp rally in local interest rate markets banks could cut mortgage rates today if they wanted
3058988 after all one of the majors westpac last week reported robust revenue growth of 8 9 per cent anticipated and was on track for 6 8 per cent cash earnings growth for 2008
3058989 other banks will grow their profits despite difficult conditions globally
3058990 a key fact here is that the 90 day bank bill rate has fallen sharply over the past 10 days
3058991 i suspect the major banks will follow any initial 25 basis points rba cut with a 20 25 basis point cut in mortgage rates whereas a 50 basis point rba cut might be followed by a 40 50 basis point cut in mortgage rates
3058992 it wouldnt surprise me to see one of the big four break ranks
3058993 then we might start seeing some competition but its not a foregone conclusion none of them will give an undertaking to pass on the full cut
3058994 i imagine there wouldve been phone calls from higher up given theres big profits coming out
3058995 its back to school tomorrow ive got to start studying for the end of term tests but it was awesome out there tonight
3058996 i still get nervous before each game but i was surprised he wasnt nervous at all
3058997 i just wanted to do my friends and family proud tonight
3058998 it was a dream come true it is surreal being out here the game went so quick
3058999 my teammates have been good to me over the past week or so and they want me to push them around thats my job when the forwards get slack
3059000 my defence wasnt on par there were a few big boys out there and its something i will work on my attack was sound although i got roughed up that is something you expect i wished i could have scored that try
3059001 he showed touches of class but hes not really ready
3059002 i wanted to see how he handled it for the future i was happy
3059003 his chip kick early showed there is no shortage of confidence
3059004 it doesnt appear that he will die wondering it would have been a bit scary and i imagine his mum and dad would have been a bit nervous
3059005 wow what are you doing all the way over here
3059006 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3059007 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3059008 theres no way you would describe this effort at this point as anything but an overwhelming success thats important for two reasons
3059009 i meet so many amazing accordion players in my travels and i thought it would be really fun to bring some of the best together
3059010 we are seeing a stream of attacks through links that tempt you to watch a video peoples alarm bells should be ringing when they receive unsolicited messages like this especially if they are told to install code
3059011 i havent ridden my bike in decades do you know anyone whod want it
3059012 well i got it when i was studying in europe i brought it back on the boat with me i had to go get it at the workshop i was too tall for the stock bikes in the store

3059014 well it is blue it has white plastic fenders and it was made in 1954 its all original except i had new tires put on about 20 years ago

3059016 i dont want to buy your game because it stinks
3059017 we remain committed to punishing those who violate the law and try to harm our members
3059018 it does say one thing once you get big enough and start causing trouble with the elites theyll find a way to deal with you
3059019 companies understand that they have to police their community keeping it neat and orderly is doing their job its just the cost of doing business

3059025 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3059026 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist

3059051 he has looked very focused and hungry but he picked up a little injury in his knee and its disappointing for robert luke picked up a nothing injury really in training and its also disappointing for him
3059052 when they are fit and ready it will just add to the competition looking at the team on saturday against real mallorca you would have to say robert koren would have been threatening that starting xi
3059053 it seems to have settled down quite quickly and hopefully he will have a chance for next week

3059061 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface

3059087 everything we wanted was built into it for less cost
3059088 the bottom line is that for institutions to survive financially in the coming years they are going to have to adopt more business like operating practices
3059089 what we have done is concentrated every year on the more complex projects our members find it hard to do on their own because frankly thats where the bigger savings are
3059090 its going to have a huge impact on his brand because what theyve been trying to do with the businessweek com 5 1 08 is to make it seem more global you cant get a better stage than the opening ceremony of a global event like the olympics
3059091 we are quite happy with our business here in china

3059103 in five years we plan to hold about 1 million square metres of commercial space in central beijing which will represent 70 of our net asset value
3059104 but we are still very much focused on earnings growth and earnings growth still comes from selling properties the soho brand is about selling and we can sell at higher prices and faster than others it would be a shame if we dont capitalise on that so we will continue to sell
3059105 these are high net worth individuals who may have a coal mine or a factory in guangzhou and who want to buy downtown commercial property for leasing and for asset appreciation so we sell to them now we think we should move on to own a bit more ourselves
3059106 as the day of the long awaited opening ceremony arrives chinas economy is indeed slowing
3059107 new orders at factories have declined and the countrys property market has seen a sharp drop in transaction volumes
3059108 chinas manufacturing sector is facing tough challenges due to the slowdown in the global economy rising production costs tight credit conditions power shortages and currency appreciation
3059109 if growth goes lower than 8 the government will be very worried
3059110 the inflow of hot money has had some negative impact on the economy it is hoped that the regulation can enhance monitoring and control some speculative investment and foreign capital inflows
3059111 the slowdown will be less severe than olympics pessimists predict

3059120 interestingly all this is true but that does not take away from the creditable performance of indias domestic it market
3059121 at 24 5 billion the indian domestic it market is not exactly a small market yet in dollar terms it grew 50 per cent in other words it added half of itself to it
3059122 over the next few years staff augmentation and project based deals would gradually dwindle to be replaced by more comprehensive outsourcing engagements
3059123 this change has been an eye opener of sorts because for the first time people seem to have woken up to the potential of the domestic bpo market
3059124 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
3059125 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
3059126 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
3059127 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
3059128 you told me more about the process than i know
3059129 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
3059130 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
3059131 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
3059132 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
3059133 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
3059134 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
3059135 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores

3059152 people don t really believe everything we show and say
3059153 this is a free country grownups are free to make their own decisions and mistakes
3059154 this was a very welcome read as ive lately been struggling with setting stricter boundaries to what i do and dont agree to produce my main area of work is web design and programming and recently weve been asked to do a number of different projects which ive turned down and invariably this makes people frustrated both potential clients and co workers because it impacts on their work too and it naturally means that my value judgment objects to the work they do or products they sell
3059155 in my case this has most recently had to do with e commerce being a long time strict vegetarian vegan i always found it saddening when i start working on a shopping system and i start to consider that the client is selling products which i strongly object to be they leather fur or other animal based products ive come to realize though that of course no one is forcing me to do these sites and if i cant judge what projects i can morally accept to work on how can i expect others to act differently
3059156 there are many grey areas in terms of ethics when it comes to work one does on a day to day level at the end of the day our daily lives are filled with ethical decision making large and small life is political and there is always an ethical dimension to everything we do its likely that well always slip here or there so the more reason to be considerate and thoughtful when it comes to those moments when we do have the option to influence the situation
3059157 i applaud your stance on this theory unfortunately reality has historically made that decision very difficult for both experienced and novice job seekers it is a tough job market out there and there is a lot of competition for graphic design jobs in the case of eating or standing by ones beliefs eating is probably going to win out
3059158 i believe what you are referring to in your article falls in line with my own thoughts about cognitive dissonance the sense of guilt you have when continuing to do something that you know is inherently wrong or generally at odds with your own beliefs i think people often self rationalize the reasons why they do something they know isn t right or they simply block out the potential consequences
3059159 when it comes to marketing and advertising i believe the ends justifies the means mentality is very dangerous because you are not involved in a private endeavor you re creating something to be distributed in mass quantities with the explicit purpose of reaching as many people as possible with your message for myself working in the realm of non profit health care services often lends the sense of false security that the promotion of our services is always for the greater good but i think you re exactly right that no one can afford to wear blinders as an artist designer or marketer
3059160 the question i would like to pose is how do the media companies who continue to promote cigarettes and smoking advertising justify those ends to their employees to their other clients to their families to their kids is it the safety in numbers that a large firm provides is it the money
3059161 thank you bringing this up years ago my boss gave me real estate photos to edit for a website my instructions were to replace the tilled dirt in the front yard with green grass unfortunately i did it and have always felt like the buyers of those homes were going to be sorely disappointed i will say no to photoshop tricks of that nature from now on
3059162 i find myself less challenged with these ideas as a designer than as a copywriter as you say you can attract a customer with fantasy but you can only deliver fact in my mind the visuals are the fantasy part the attraction part the perception part the words should fill in with the meat and the meat should be the truth creatively wordsmithed of course
3059163 i have often found myself working with clients or organizations that have different world philosophies than i do that too can be a challenge because if i choose to work with them i also feel i should keep my own beliefs to myself in some cases it has worked out well because i bring an outsider perspective to the table which helps the client and their diverse viewpoints also help stretch me on the other hand i have also chosen to leave two jobs during my career in part because the beliefs and attitudes espoused by my employer ran contrary to what is important to me it is not worth the paycheck
3059164 a lot of people want to believe that marketing is manipulation and maybe the advertising image side of marketing is a bit manipulative to varying degrees depending on the company and the ethics of those making the image decisions but marketing isnt just about making a promise its about delivering on the promise thats why every political campaign is a marketing failure at the end of the day and why our country is so disillusioned when it comes to political marketing no candidate has ever been or ever will be able to deliver
3059165 its refreshing and encouraging to know that you and other designers out there try to work ethically and have a moral compass yes we need to be much more than just hired guns and not cave to just any pressure or request if you think about it any profession can can be corrupted if the members comprise their values and ethics or the opposite a group can raise its standards value and respectability within a society

3059170 unlike america denmark which was so badly hammered by the 1973 arab oil embargo that it banned all sunday driving for a while responded to that crisis in such a sustained focused and systematic way that today it is energy independent
3059171 i dont disagree with your article but it doesnt address the possibility that clients may choose a designer because they have a certain look in those cases the client would actually be disappointed to get something different
3059172 im thinking of a local designer i know he does a lot of logos icons and infographics his work has a very distinctive look and i think his clients choose him because thats what they want his work could almost be classified as art though so that might be a loophole to what you were writing about
3059173 i agree that all of one s design pieces shouldn t look the same to a certain extent however a lot of people who hire me do so because they like my design style which has been described as clean i m not saying i m above putting in flourishes or elaborate borders etc if warranted but if someone hires me based on my portfolio i assume that they like the cleanliness of my work and would be disappointed if i present them with something that looks like it came out of a mid 90 s wired magazine
3059174 over the years i have had many conversations with young graphic designers usually still in school who really didnt understand that their only job is to help their client communicate to his target audience it isnt about their art or their need to show off their photoshop skills i agree that as designers we should be invisible put our ego aside and help our client shine in the marketplace
3059175 i had this very debate with a person who is just starting out in design and he told me that design is a matter of personal taste sure when you are doing your own home or landscaping or buying furniture but when you designing a fifty thousand dollar annual report for a client its not about your personal taste its about the client its always about the client
3059176 it is most likely difficult to let go of that one precious idea you had in a long time i used to think that if i could just use collaboration of some parts from previous design then maybe a new client would really appreciate my idea but soon after i came to realize that it is indeed a true challenge of a designer for each new time start with a clean slate
3059177 i think that your article takes it too far in making it sound like that the designer should have no personal expression or inherent style of their own i think that if you examine most freelancers portfolios that you can clearly see what their personal style is and that this is a good thing and doesnt need to be avoided there is a part of our work that is artistic and is about our own personal style and vision
3059178 im talking about the solo designers here who are not combining groups of people together and who probably as an individual artistic person are going to have somewhat of a design identity themselves that they bring to the table for their clients
3059179 i think it is important to set aside self expression when designing for someone else or when presenting to another group like an association or a business etc self expression should be reserved for self promotion when advertising yourself so others can see what you can do for them but the bottom line is what you can do for them and how you can meet their needs
3059180 youre on the right track in that youre not leaving your own signature on your work for the sake of doing so
3059181 i have struggled with how to be freshly creative every time theres a new project but if im not willing to give my best effort to every client or to my own organization i have a serious problem and as you point out that problem ripples outwardly and quickly theres plenty of rubbish design out there no one needs me to add to the pile
3059182 i agree for the most part i also disagree the entire purpose of commercial graphic design is to convey a specific message about the product or service itself however when done through design the design will ultimately carry a part of the designers personality that part along with the product service it was allows marketing pieces to remain unique and stand out in a crowded market that is also the reason why certain designers get hired more than others lets face it your personality is all over your web site books amp overall design layouts font styles etc thats what makes ideabook exclusively chuck green
3059183 i am the client and you are spot on accurate about your experiences insights and bottom line conclusion i go through the exact same thing that youve captured so beautifully and even though i am on the client end i also need to give back to my corporation what it needs for its purposes and audiences not what i like or feel like doing over the decades i have had many many challenges working with design folk for one thing knowing when and how you can approach them because they are so temperamental and can be ultra sensitive about their work
3059184 your article provides a great challenge to any aspiring graphic designer whether theyre new to the business or have been at it a long time
3059185 i dont need anyone writing to me unbidden to preach cliches about the design business in future please keep your meanderings to yourself and stay out of my inbox
3059186 from a client side point of view and a not very experienced one at that i rather expect self expression to some extent in a designers work i would choose a designer from their portfolio and pick one whose style was appropriate for my audience if i was retaining a designer or requesting new work from someone with whom i had worked before i would bear in mind their ability to create new work in a new style if that was what i needed if they were a one trick pony i would employ a new designer
3059187 for instance i have previously worked in what used to be new media department of a large marketing agency in london i had a choice of a few in house designers and would pick the one who had completed work closest to the brief i wouldnt purposely challenge them to design outside their style lazy but time efficient
3059188 what you are describing is what clients would love but dont really expect a whole new canvas approach each time due to the fact that these days it is frightfully easy to hop from service to service i would assume that it is harder and harder for a designer to retain clients i would remain loyal to a designer but for other reasons than self expression
3059189 on the other end if a designer can achieve a measurable return on investment for their client using a personal brand of design so be it
3059190 as a retired instructor in a graphic design program i may be able to add a different perspective in my comments about your article i certainly echo the remarks that it is all about the client but even more it s about the client s objectives and measuring the results obviously some results are easier to measure than others counting shoes sales vs measuring a change in the consumers mind about the product service dealing with a client who has no fuzzy objectives can be daunting but not untypical with a small business person a designer must be prepared to spend some time with client exploring his her concepts about the business second knowing your intended market is also essential our students write profiles about other demographic groups different from their own and finally knowing what the competition is up to is also helpful is there any creativity in here of course pulling together all these ideas and coming up with a visual that meets the client s objectives that s where the true creativity lies oh and one more thing following the specs i ve had students hand in assignments that did not meet the specs e g horizontal not vertical and sometimes it does work better but you need to follow the rules before you ignore them
3059191 very interesting for eight years ive started portfolio reviews with a prospective client by reminding the viewer that what they are about to see is more reflective of the product or client than my artistic style i go on to say that they will not see rock band posters in my portfolio it lightens the moment and i use the opportunity to explain the difference between an illustrator artist and graphic designer this approach helps manage their expectations
3059192 what i do from there is use several pieces to describe my approach to the design process including their input review and ultimate acceptance of the piece s
3059193 my prior career was business oriented not design oriented ive taken what i learned in business and applied it to my graphic design and it has resulted in a diverse client base there are so many talented young artists out there that lack this very important piece of business knowledge
3059194 im currently in debate with an online classmate regarding similar issues he thinks that the wealthy artists make their art to make money i know from experience that the wealthy artist makes money doing what he loves and doesnt go into art to make money i think if the kid doesnt soon change his attitude the consumer he hopes to attract will quickly see through the sham and wont look twice at his work from experience i know that authentic art becomes famous and that koons warhol and the like did art because they had fun making art anyway the same kid tried to use commercial illustrators as an example saying that many commercial art pieces became famous sought after works i pointed out that yes the work started out as a job but became sought after because the artist put more spirit into his her work than mere craft but those artists still managed to meet the clients needs by giving more of themselves and creating value for their client any monkey can learn to draw well an artist draws well with soul i make fine art for self expression and love of making i make commercial art to pay the bills i dont anticipate my commercial art becoming famous other than for the reason that my fine art may become famous although most of my commercial art is geared more toward client identity and not distinguishable as my work i try to give my client good value for their dollar but im not going to put the same level of passion into it as i do for my fine art works my fine art is great fun creating sometimes controversial dialog that is to my liking my commercial art is slightly less fun making imagery identity and business media useful to the client for selling his her product my commercial art is not about me its about the clients product identity and if i try to make it all about me than i am not serving my client i am serving my ego i relegate the ego to the closet it doesnt pay the bills
3059195 essentially i agree with you the only exception i remember where the formula concept worked was bbd amp os formula for their clients volkswagen levys bread etc that major ad agencys ads all bore a clean simple product photo and brief one sentence or phrase copy it worked very well in the 50s and 60s perhaps longer
3059196 i agree with your idea whole heartedly but then yourconcepts apply equally well to my profession technical writing and editing in writing my job is to communicate in whatever style vocabulary organization works best for the intended audience and my personality shouldnt be visible in editing my job is to make the authors personality as clear as possible not impose my quirks opinions favorite turns of phrase etc
3059197 of course neither commercial designers nor writers can avoid it totally because its impossible for mere humans to be 100 objective and still blend in some artistry im sure my quirks opinions and turns of phrase creep in anyway and leave little cat paw prints on a few paragraphs here and there especially when im in a hurry
3059198 define the difference between an artist who paints for self expression and a designer
3059199 the difference between a designer and a painter is very slight
3059200 so my point stands i understand the demands of clients to fit within a specific mold but there has been a pendulum swing in the past twenty years in the direction of more and more client control as design has become a very available commodity the work of studio dumbar stands out as an example of the kind of work that i am suggesting more designer driven than client driven i guess the trick is finding clients who really understand the role of an educated and creative group but experimentation and possible failure always looms in the minds of the bean counters
3059201 the comments on the web site are very interesting but i think some are missing the point or and sorry for me being so bold but designers are incredibly proud people and the very thought of being told what to do outrages most of them
3059202 the observations you made are actually pretty dam clear and in my opinion much needed sometimes
3059203 i hated being told what to do and if you catch me on a bad day i still do but being humble is such a blessing it helps take the pressure off of being perfect and having the most amazing ground breaking design it frees you to problem solve easily and helps you stick to the brief without fearing the outcome i put so much pressure on myself to get the finished product to be out of this world i say what will be will be and let the chips fall where they may
3059204 i think designers struggle with this issue because they also struggle with ego issues inserting oneself into a design doesnt have much to do with the success of the piece which has its own innate purpose and must represent the client brand in fact having a look as a designer can be graphic death it could lead to the equivalent of an actor being typecast why limit oneself
3059205 as a visual communicator im merely a channel through which form meets function for my client not for me playing this role well is where effective designers need to find self satisfaction i also find that embracing this philosophy keeps me sane when im required to integrate elements that i wouldnt choose if i were designing for myself i dont own the design it has its own purpose i can make recommendations but if my happiness is too big a part of the equation the design can become convoluted
3059206 a designer isnt the same thing as an artist a designer is a businessperson a press operator a diplomat a media specialist a marketing whiz a researcher a technician and an artist all rolled into one individual with expensive magazine subscriptions
3059207 i guess im not really an artist but a layout designer i didnt go to art school or even college but just have a knack and practical sense for layout and design which began on the newspaper staff in high school i have little to no need for self expression in my design just a need to help my clients express what they have to offer in an attractive easy to read format i have done a little bit of seminar type teaching on graphic design and one point i always make is the purpose of all marketing materials is that they are read not to be framed and displayed as a work of art when i do an initial consultation with a client i also make it very clear that design is subjective and i am here to make them happy i want them to feel ownership of the end product to be proud to hand out their business cards brochures or whatever and on a few occasions ive designed something i wasnt so fond of myself but my client was happy to see their vision on paper
3059208 i think theres a bit of arrogance in some designers and in our society in general which causes an attitude of its all about me and my talent

3059212 it has been known for years that magnetic stripe cards can easily be tampered with and mbta should not have relied on the obscurity of their data format as a security measure
3059213 mbta made it clear that they are not interested in cooperating with researchers on identifying and fixing vulnerabilities but their lawsuit will motivate more research into the security of bostons public transport system

3059231 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares

3059236 for the first time in 10 months producers raw material costs fell in july
3059237 the mpc will remain on guard for signs that the sharp rises in pipeline price pressures seen over the last year are feeding through into inflation on the high street for some months yet but there does at last seem to be some light emerging at the end of the inflation tunnel

3059250 i attended friday night lights at the university of florida
3059251 i enjoyed floridas campus but i had a bad camp they measured me at 6 3
3059252 i drove through the south carolina campus on my way home it was ok but i didnt get that good of a feeling from it
3059253 i havent been to stanford but i hear its nice ole miss was one of the best ive seen virginia techs buildings all look the same i like the way their campus looks florida state had a good one and i love their stadium auburn also has an incredible campus
3059254 recruiting is going good i need to sit down with my dad and listen to what schools he likes and then discuss the schools i like we need to compare notes then i will decide where im going to take my visits
3059255 ive stayed in contact with ole miss i email kent austin a lot i also stay in touch with auburn i didnt make it to their campus this summer but i went the previous summer our coach is killing us with two a days so ive had to step back from recruiting a bit
3059256 i would say ole miss florida state virginia tech georgia tech auburn stanford and colorado are the main schools im looking at now but that could change
3059257 most schools are recruiting me to play ol auburn told me that i could try ol dl and te virginia tech is recruiting me to play dl ole miss is the only school focusing on me playing te this year is my first year to play te and ive always wanted to do it ole miss told me that if te didnt work out for me they still wanted me because of my athletic ability i thought that was pretty cool
3059258 its hard to say ive always wanted to play te well just have to see how it works out
3059259 i really like coach kent austin at ole miss everything you hear about coach houston nutt being a players coach is true meeting him in person was amazing he told my mom that he would make sure i had a 3 0 and that she would get weekly updates on me he also said if i started missing class hed personally wait for me there everyday hes intense coach austin also told me that coach nutt never cusses his players no one likes being cusses out so i thought that was pretty special

3059283 this is not about simplistic league tables this is about rich performance information about our schools
3059284 we can learn from kleins methodology of comparing like schools with like schools and then measuring the differences in school results in order to spread best practice
3059285 something joel klein is personally and passionately committed to is the identification of school need the comparison of like schools and the identification of best practice
3059286 the answer is not league tables and its not a to f reporting but its making sure we have this rich performance information available school by school
3059287 raising overall student performance and addressing underachievement requires investment teachers know it and parents know it
3059288 were better off identifying the kind of extra value that education offers so that we measure the progress people are making
3059289 this isnt about shaming people or telling people that theyve done badly
3059290 this is about understanding whats going on so that we can help schools that need extra assistance and its only by helping those schools that need extra assistance that were really going to have an education revolution for all australian kids in all australian schools

3059303 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3059304 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3059305 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3059306 cursa tarom cu 47 de pasageri av nd destina ia sofia a decolat n jurul orei 16
3059307 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3059308 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3059309 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3059310 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3059311 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3059319 it sounds so unbelievable that sir alex should make such alarming statements i think this is just media speculation and sir alex is in a position to make further clarifications if it is not done we would then know what to do and the appropriate steps to take
3059320 we do not take such statements lightly if he believed rooney contacted a virus in nigeria we had expected him to communicate this to us formally but he has not done that and we feel this may just be hearsay
3059321 however we are compelled to demand clarifications from sir alex because he was quoted by media reports maybe he only used the nigeria tour to capture his sojourn in africa during the pre season where he first went to south africa and spent a week at the vodacom challenge before coming to nigeria to spend less than 24 hours
3059322 united arrived abuja at about 2 00am from south africa had a light work out before sir alex david gill and fletcher came out to address the media at a noon parley that did not last more than an hour

3059344 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3059345 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3059346 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3059347 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3059348 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3059349 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3059350 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3059351 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3059352 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3059353 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3059354 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3059355 he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst

3059358 he died for our sins and rose again for our justification
3059359 he loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood

3059367 listen were going to look at three houses today and youre going to buy one of them
3059368 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3059369 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3059370 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3059371 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3059372 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3059373 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3059374 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3059375 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3059376 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3059377 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3059378 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3059379 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3059380 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3059381 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3059382 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3059383 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3059384 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3059385 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3059386 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3059387 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3059388 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3059389 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3059390 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3059391 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3059392 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3059393 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3059394 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3059395 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3059396 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3059397 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3059398 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3059399 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3059400 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3059406 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3059407 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3059408 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3059409 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3059411 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3059412 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3059413 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3059414 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3059415 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3059416 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3059425 now from a political point of view i think a john mccain presidency will be disastrous for the gop in the long term and certainly disastrous for conservative principles within the gop in fact i think an obama presidency in which things generally proceed from bad to worse would even be better for conservatism in the long term

3059429 the loss definitely goes in the right mans hands tonight it just comes down to executing pitches you execute a few pitches you get outs you dont execute pitches you dont get outs its pretty simple
3059430 the only thing he really doesnt like doing is leading off you put him in there on a day like today when you have a big hole out of your lineup and look what he does he gives us production he always gives you a professional at bat and it makes it a little bit easier for guys like manny ramirez when david or manny doesnt play our lineup obviously looks different im sure the opponents are thrilled when one of those guys isnt in there but then a guy like youk steps in and gives us half our offense
3059431 what can i say its just one of those days where i thought i had good stuff felt like i was able to locate the ball for the most part and do what i wanted to do with it
3059432 those hits they got stuff like that you cant defend thats baseball

3059473 because women questioned for the marriage survey were between 20 24 years of age this figure shows us a trend that is recent its shocking that nearly half the women in that age group many from progressive states were married off before they attained the age of 18 in some of the countrys biggest states over half the women met this fate this has serious implications on their chances of higher education and their fertility rate
3059474 this is a disturbing trend even though several states like andhra pradesh rajasthan and up have shown a decline in this practice in nfhs iii the numbers are still above 50 this shows that the child marriage restraint act of 1976 isnt being implemented effectively by several states

3059488 over time the mortgage market should continue to improve from its current position the number of products will steadily increase and rates will lower with increased competition between lenders
3059489 the standard factors which usually determine the rates at which mortgage rates are set including bank base rate swap rates and libor rates are all much lower than this time last year yet the rates on offer are much higher
3059490 as house prices continue to fall and the risk of default increases the lenders are pricing more for risk and as a result these standard factors are not quite as influential on the rates as they once were

3059498 the bishop believes your ministry to be divisive is uncertain that ordinary pastoral care of parishioners is taking place and does not have confidence that you will celebrate the ordinary form of the mass with a generous heart for the vast majority of parishioners who expect sunday and weekday masses to be in english and at an altar facing the people

3059535 my subject matter at the moment involves people they are portraits but more than just portraits
3059536 my failures in oil and acrylic were frustrating and i was unsure of what i wanted to do with my art
3059537 i remember being introduced to the work of andrew wyeth back in high school i just loved the detail and imagery and the idea of painting with egg when i started looking for a change i revisited the work of wyeth and other artists who painted with egg tempera such as tooker cadmus and french and i thought id try it
3059538 it begins with a seed of an idea that surrounds something i may be going through at the moment i then start to consider imagery that best represents those ideas or feelings
3059539 egg tempera is a slower medium you have to slow down and build the painting in layers stroke by stroke as opposed to pushing paint around as you would when working in oil for that reason it can be frustrating to artists just starting out but i encourage them to be persistent
3059540 on a fundamental level i want to create beautiful images that are visually appealing but also engage the viewer emotionally
3059541 i was having difficulty putting what i wanted to say into writing when i was earning my masters
3059542 i thought this is what im trying to do but with words
3059543 when i started at the art students league it was really hard to look at my work
3059544 my art was very tied up in the search going on inside of me and i found it personal and private i tended to keep to myself during classes and didnt really socialize with other students during breaks
3059545 when youre studying something like philosophy youre searching for truths basically
3059546 my work always seems balanced between an analytical measured approach and an emotional and existential one
3059547 i realized that in my actual world i was surrounded by things that hung off of not only walls but also chairs and tables all around me my clothing my husbands clothing the clothing i wear when im painting
3059548 one day i noticed how the late afternoon light hit those shirts and i saw that it could be a painting what more natural thing to paint and subsequently hang on a wall than a shirt that was already hanging on a wall or door
3059549 i love the quiet focus that comes with simply laying down marks i would love for that to go on forever
3059550 towards the end i may do some glazing but i think that in a way when working with oils that are naturally transparent one is glazing throughout the process
3059551 i am rarely content with a painting that seems assembled or posed merely for the purpose of making a nice picture
3059552 when i first started painting at ted seth jacobs studio in france i constantly asked myself why i was standing in front of an easel and i could never and still cant answer that question i actually think every painting i create is an attempt to find an answer
3059553 i loved my job but working with abused children took so much out of me emotionally
3059554 i knew i needed something to escape to and painting became my therapy
3059555 watching it mingle and make new colors i was hooked
3059556 i liked the fact that i could paint for 10 minutes sometimes i only had 10 minutes
3059557 i painted at my kitchen counter while making dinner actually these quick works were just a way of getting a handle on the medium i was more playing with the paints than actually making a painting
3059558 it can be a coyote far off in a field a snow drift or simply a vivid color
3059559 i rarely will paint something that is not a challenge for me i strive to keep learning
3059560 i try to remember to do a value sketch but i often find myself in too much of a hurry to start painting when im doing a wildlife scene i just sketch the animal onto the watercolor paper and nothing else i then wet the paper and start laying in the sky and take it from there
3059561 if you have a desire it will happen oh and never forget to have fun we may not all become winslow homer but if you enjoy it thats all thats important
3059562 i was always frustrated that my artwork came second i felt i could produce much better work if i could devote my full energy to it
3059563 over the last two years my subject matter has become what i call contemporary still life
3059564 i am always inspired and challenged by the representational tradition of realism in oil painting and i am equally intrigued by the energy and freedom of contemporary art for this reason my still lifes employ a careful execution in a realistic style and also combine contemporary compositional elements such as close ups sparse setups clean lines and the like
3059565 i stage everything in my studio playing with different lighting and element arrangements and photographing the variations
3059566 the first stage is the most challenging as far as creativity is concerned
3059567 because i am trying to display the elements of a classical style while still trying to keep it fresh and contemporary
3059568 as an artist still life painting provides me with total control over the mood lighting composition and overall look of the piece
3059569 with the first layer being opaque and done in middle tones over this first layer i apply transparent glazes and opaque scumbles building up the color and definition some passages are done wet in wet others are not
3059570 i feel my compositions are such that even though no figure is present the elements and arrangements hint at the human touch indirectly
3059571 to create illusions that help us understand and enhance what we call reality
3059572 my attachment to the outdoors motivates me to record scenes on paper as a way of preserving what is disappearing
3059573 i have always been emotionally drawn to scenes and events where i live
3059574 i dont think you have to go farther than your own backyard to find inspiration it could be anything from the way a shadow falls on an interesting cluster of buildings i just know it when i see it
3059575 being able to render whatever i wanted fairly accurately meant that i only had to learn about the mechanics of paint
3059576 the biggest challenge was color after a few years of using color by instinct i wanted to know why certain colors worked and others didnt and how i could control them so i became a student of color theory reading every book i could find on the subject the old adage of practice makes perfect really was true for me there are no shortcuts
3059577 every day before you start painting do a little experimentation
3059578 either with color by mixing some paints never tried before or by applying paint on a different kind of surface or any other technique youve read about and wanted to try as for subject matter i tell them to paint what they know and love paint what moves you
3059579 not having a business to go back to gave me the freedom to try something new
3059580 i dont know what sparked it but always knew i wanted to paint the ice of antarctica
3059581 the first paintings i created immediately after my trip were very small i really think of them as sketches but they were enough to get me started
3059582 i had trouble explaining what i wanted to do even though i could see it so clearly
3059583 it wasnt until i took a class with wendy soneson at the brookline arts center in massachusetts that i was able to put it all together
3059584 people were exploring ways of using watercolor beyond realistic landscapes and still lifes so i was really able to develop my own ideas in a safe environment
3059585 water is my subject so it makes sense that it is my medium
3059586 i have found that when taking on a subject such as these extreme landscapes the term abstract becomes less important
3059587 in general my work is more realistic and representational which can be a surprise to those unfamiliar with the antarctic landscape
3059588 seeing the landscape made me rethink how we perceive water and ice which have so many manifestations and are beautiful and ever changing in antarctica dirt and snow algae can create amazing effects and the icebergs are so dense that the only light that passes through produce a clear blue
3059589 each color is mixed on the paper which i feel makes the watercolor look so alive as the colors are forming on the paper i have the opportunity to create mixtures that reflect the image im working from
3059590 because of my process i have to wait for the painting to dry at least a day or two before i can continue i tend to have two or three pieces in progress at one time so i am able to go between them
3059591 it gives the pieces a sculptural aspect much like the landscape itself when i frame the pieces they are almost always floating so that movement becomes part of the piece i think of this as a way of putting less distance between the viewer and the painting
3059592 these days i dont work with anything less than 300 lb watercolor paper arches or fabriano
3059593 in fact in the past year or so i have been working mainly with 300 lb extra white hot pressed fabriano paper switching from lighter paper to heavier paper was like a leap to a different world its really hard to go back to a 140 lb stock when you work on paper that cant handle the water you dont really know what you can do
3059594 i had originally gone to antarctica to see blue whales but there werent any
3059595 i learned that between 1905 and 1966 when it became illegal to hunt them nearly 300 000 blue whales had been caught and there are only about 300 left in the antarctic seas now it was so moving to me to think that there were only 300 left down there i knew i had to create 300 paintings
3059596 its always good to have different voices in your head and to have a different set of tools to rely on
3059597 i go to shows and think i cant do that
3059598 but im not discouraged its great knowing that theres so much more to learn
3059599 theres no such thing as someone who doesnt think artistically whenever you choose a radio station to listen to or the color to paint your dining room wall you are making an artistic choice i think anyone can do what im doing if they have a connection to the medium and their subject
3059600 we have no right to ask when a sorrow comes why did this happen to me unless we ask the same question for every joy that comes our way

3059603 logisch dat je dan even uit je dak gaat als het allemaal goed afloopt maar nu gaan we ons voorbereiden op de britten dat is een fitte sterke ploeg die overal op het veld druk zet daarmee moeten we rekening houden maar we moeten er ook van kunnen profiteren
3059604 iedereen had er ook ongelooflijk veel zin in bij ons de eerste helft was niet fantastisch nee we bleken toch een beetje moeite met de vermeende last van de openingswedstrijd te hebben ook de olympische debutanten moesten even op gang komen we speelden voor de rust met iets te weinig lef we moesten er even doorheen komen
3059605 obviously we announced the title for both the ps3 and 360 so in that sense were very excited to be able to appeal to a new user base and to fans that are users of both ps3 and 360 another thing im excited about it that its traditionally taken about a year for localisation to take place so the japanese version can reach audiences around the world but with this title were focused on decreasing that time gap that means right now were not only involved in creating and developing but also working hard to deliver the title in a fresh state to everyone in the world

3059633 il pd troppo democratico dallaltra parte ci sono due leader fortissimi berlusconi e bossi veltroni debole dovrebbe puntare i piedi cambiare i vertici puntare sulle liste civiche su sindaci personaggi come variati a vicenza o chiamparino a torino

3059668 the proposal of high price increases and more water meters combined with the rising cost of energy bills could hurt many households
3059669 london has some of the countrys poorest areas and the government needs to seriously consider ways to help those who cannot afford to pay for their water
3059670 thames customers have enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years but we now need to make essential investment to secure their services for the future
3059671 consumers are likely to see significantly different bills depending on whether they are metered or not with unmetered customers being harder hit than metered customers
3059672 against this background and in line with general economic trends increased problems with customer debt will emerge as an issue for the water industry
3059673 while we expect to see the many water companies increase their funding for schemes to assist vulnerable customers who will have difficulty meeting these proposed increases they are also likely to increase their efforts to collect from customers who can pay but wont and to target unbilled properties

3059759 it is clear that russias current leadership is bent on restoring a neocolonial form of control over the entire space once governed by moscow
3059760 when this failed the kremlin turned its attention to south ossetia ordering its proxies there to escalate attacks on georgian positions
3059761 my government answered with a unilateral cease fire the separatists began attacking civilians and russian tanks pierced the georgian border we had no choice but to protect our civilians and restore our constitutional order
3059762 yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia

3059791 for the sake of the environment it is critical to look at future steel vehicle as all vehicles from a life cycle assessment lca perspective
3059792 based on the recent lca study and model developed at the university of california santa barbara implementation of more efficient powertrain systems elevates the importance of the emissions from material production placing greater emphasis on selecting a low greenhouse gas intensive material such as steel
3059793 compared to other materials used to reduce vehicle weight these advanced high strength steels produce five to 15 times less greenhouse gas emissions during the material manufacturing phase which greatly reduces a vehicles life cycle carbon footprint
3059794 were not just looking at the vehicle design and its impact on ghg at the tailpipe
3059795 were concerned with the whole life cycle of the vehicle from the emissions produced and energy used to create raw materials all the way to the impact of recycling if the whole life cycle is not taken into account there is the distinct possibility of having a net increase in greenhouse gasses if the wrong material choice is made this isnt just speculation we have very clear models that demonstrate this
3059796 millions of americans are facing tough challenges every day from the economy to the war in iraq to the housing crisis to crippling energy costs everywhere you go across this country people are calling for change they know we cant afford four more years of the same old divisive politics that are light on policy specifics and ways to help people and heavy on cynicism and negativity the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need the 2008 convention is about ensuring that those peoples voices are heard and their call for change is heeded

3059800 this is primarily due to the following factors income taxes go down after retirement social security taxes end completely social security benefits are partially or fully tax free and saving for retirement is no longer needed that said our 2008 replacement ratio study truly illustrates the importance of saving and the overwhelming challenges that lie ahead for those who dont save adequately
3059801 the most significant issue retirees will face moving forward is outliving assets
3059802 the convergence of medical advancements enabling people to live longer and worker apathy toward retirement savings is creating a perfect storm which may result in millions of americans with little money left as they advance through their golden years the pension protection act of 2006 includes provisions so employees can be automatically enrolled in company retirement plans however the responsibility of retirement still rests with the employee to determine if thats enough to ensure a well funded retirement
3059803 an employee with a typical 401k for example has to bear all equity interest rate inflation and longevity risk that employers used to bear so the bottom line is save
3059804 if youre saving now make sure its an appropriate amount based on all factors if youre not saving start doing so today its never too late to start saving but the later you start the more you will need to save to make up for years of not doing so
