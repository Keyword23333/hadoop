3040000 we were very close to being in the quarter finals but now at the end we are very far
3040001 it was a hell of a fight after starting slowly we settled the ball and began to play our game
3040002 i told them before the game dont worry about the big names on the dutch team it means nothing if you dont fight we scored two great goals but in the end it wasnt enough
3040003 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3040004 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3040005 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3040006 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3040007 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3040008 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3040009 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3040010 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3040011 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3040012 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3040013 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3040014 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3040015 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3040016 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3040017 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3040018 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3040019 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3040020 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3040021 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3040022 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3040023 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3040024 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3040025 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3040026 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3040027 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3040028 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3040029 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3040030 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3040031 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3040032 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3040033 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3040034 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3040035 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3040036 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3040037 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3040038 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3040039 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3040040 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3040041 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3040042 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3040043 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3040044 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3040045 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3040046 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3040047 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3040048 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3040049 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3040050 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3040051 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3040052 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3040053 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3040054 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3040055 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3040056 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3040057 we believe our proposal is clearly superior for republics stockholders and is designed so we can work cooperatively with republic
3040058 waste managements bid is inline with the 36 38 range where we think the company could execute an all cash bid for republic without issuing additional equity and maintain its investment grade debt rating
3040059 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3040079 they were at the chill games all the time they were great supporters of liz and the chill
3040080 it was almost surreal to find out that it happened and to find out that it was people who you knew makes it pretty shocking
3040081 theyre a great family and its really tragic that something like this would happen
3040082 i remember asking him what he did for a living
3040083 they were a very close family and they really followed lizs career and did all they could to support what she was doing

3040109 we have no known motive for this savage and brutal attack
3040110 it was a vicious attack there was a lot of blood and i think in any interpretation that was a frenzied attack
3040111 we will work around the clock to catch those responsible
3040112 we have a very experienced team of detectives working on this case we have the support of the local community the area command policing and the people of newcastle to catch whoever is responsible for this horrendous crime

3040127 just the place for a snark i have said it twice
3040128 one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is
3040129 we have these huge stories going on like the one youre reporting in georgia where you have both candidates mccain and obama taking positions that the american public wants to know more about
3040130 his excuse for lying is absolutely stunning he claims he denied the affair because the reporting by the national enquirer was 99 wrong well so far theyve been about 100 right
3040131 and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back the lobbyists running his low road campaign
3040132 the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours

3040136 as voting involved viewers calling a premium rate number there was also the potential for material harm as a consequence of the two errors that occurred
3040137 however ofcom accepted that the programme did and historically always has generally instructed viewers to vote to evict and considered that it was therefore unlikely that any significant harm was caused by these two mistaken references by the presenter
3040138 like a true natures child we were born born to be wild
3040139 mccain has spent two decades cultivating the press specifically the cadre of several dozen reporters based in washington who report for the leading national newspapers and television networks
3040140 not only is mccain an extremely wealthy man who didnt have to work for any of his wealth hes also a man of very expensive tastes
3040141 of course patricians can make presidents franklin roosevelt is the prime example but as mccain continues his campaign to define obama as a high living fancypants lets not forget the mccain was born into a life of privilege and continues to live that life today
3040142 mccain question of the day do you own your own private jet mccain does

3040186 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document amp 183 as outlined in mr suskinds book
3040187 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
3040188 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
3040189 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
3040190 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
3040191 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
3040192 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
3040193 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
3040194 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization

3040214 the ultimate goal of our work over the last ten years has been to find an effective therapy for cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes we began by characterizing the unusual clinical features and debilitating impact of caps and then discovered the underlying genetic basis of the disease a major concern was whether a pharmaceutical company would expend the significant resources necessary to develop a treatment for a disease that has been diagnosed in only a few hundred patients in the united states
3040215 these publications highlight that scientists clinicians and industry can collaborate to efficiently yet rigorously develop therapies for rare diseases with significant unmet medical need as a result of this collaboration patients with caps now have an approved treatment available that can help them to effectively manage their disease
3040216 the development process for arcalyst for the treatment of caps highlights regenerons overall approach to drug development to develop drugs targeted at well documented mediators of disease focus clinical development on diseases in which those biologic mediators play a primary underlying role establish clinical proof of concept and then strive to conduct efficient pivotal studies with well validated clinical endpoints
3040217 in this case recognizing that il 1 is an active mediator of inflammatory disease we developed arcalyst to potently inhibit il 1 in the bloodstream before it can bind to its receptors once it was recognized that the genetic mutation associated with caps is associated with il 1 overproduction we rapidly initiated a pilot study to determine the clinical impact of il 1 inhibition with arcalyst based upon the clear cut responses experienced by the caps patients in the pilot study we then developed a validated instrument to assess the severity of caps symptoms over time and introduced that instrument into two randomized placebo controlled pivotal study phases

3040249 for the sake of the environment it is critical to look at future steel vehicle as all vehicles from a life cycle assessment lca perspective
3040250 based on the recent lca study and model developed at the university of california santa barbara implementation of more efficient powertrain systems elevates the importance of the emissions from material production placing greater emphasis on selecting a low greenhouse gas intensive material such as steel
3040251 compared to other materials used to reduce vehicle weight these advanced high strength steels produce five to 15 times less greenhouse gas emissions during the material manufacturing phase which greatly reduces a vehicles life cycle carbon footprint
3040252 were not just looking at the vehicle design and its impact on ghg at the tailpipe
3040253 were concerned with the whole life cycle of the vehicle from the emissions produced and energy used to create raw materials all the way to the impact of recycling if the whole life cycle is not taken into account there is the distinct possibility of having a net increase in greenhouse gasses if the wrong material choice is made this isnt just speculation we have very clear models that demonstrate this

3040467 stereo 3d is still in its infancy in many ways
3040468 we have been making impressive 3d movies but live transmissions bring their own unique challenges like every live show theres less time to make corrections and no room for error one of the big challenges has also been how to keep the parallel signals in perfect synchronisation thats a special challenge over satellite links where atmospheric conditions can be problematic to do this we have developed a solution where we multiplex the 3d signals into a single 2d signal for transmission at the receiving end we then un wrap the 2d signal back into a 3d picture we have done this before but not over such a long link and internationally we have also developed the twin camera systems that will be capturing the images in this case we will be using two camera rigs to show that 3d pictures can be cut and mixed live
3040469 this is a natural progression from last years live hd interview with robert zemeckis we are working with a group of technology partners who are at the cutting edge of 3d imaging and transmission
3040470 arqiva is delighted to have been asked to provide the communications technology and expertise behind this important and high profile 3d event our interest and experience in the digital cinema market means we are very happy to use our global assets to showcase the exciting opportunities that new technology is bringing to live event organisers and exhibitors

3040472 we manage the separate images with a special adapter that fits on the projector which then transmits the left and right eye images through the glasses to the viewer said real ds president joshua greer
3040473 the vast majority of 3d equipped theatres around the world are using real d because its not only simple to install but easy to operate with our very low cost glasses that users can keep it avoids a lot of staff intensive handling and the picture quality is truly awesome
3040474 but setting the pace is what we do each year at ibc the technology we are using is exciting enough but to have jeffrey katzenberg addressing our delegates in conversation with our good friend elizabeth daley is a real treat and unique privilege this really is the genesis of a new age in immersive cinema and broadcasting it will be a very special night for everyone

3040481 athletes keep a very strict dietary regime which is even more critical when the type of sport requires measuring and calculations of muscular mass
3040482 bat el arrives at the competitions after having consumed junk food such as those instant foods which have an affect
3040483 however she has not only succeeded in her field and made it into the olympic games but is the only representative of that field taekwondo from israel thats a huge accomplishment
3040484 everyone at seminary accepted it taekwondo practice and supported me
3040485 the only reason for practicing with boys is the simple fact that there are more of them on the team
3040486 no its a kicking match i dont see it as problematic
3040487 theres no practice on saturday and my olympic matches dont fall on saturdays we checked it
3040488 i dont see a contradiction i dont drive to the competitions theyre no a monetary prizes the referees are gentiles the only issue is food and i bring hot instant cups because theres no kosher food
3040489 but despite the obstacles bat el manages to reach the highest levels her advantages make up for the disadvantages religion poses because she is so unspoiled and believes in herself and due to her unique character she succeeds and wins even if she had to walk a few good kilometers to get to the match
3040490 eugene the dancing machine one of the best cloggers in the southeast
3040491 heres a song id like to dedicate to my wife

3040494 were really thrilled at the reception weve got today we had great support from a lot of wonderful co sponsors and were already beginning to think about next years event
3040495 this event would not have been possible without all the great community support and the exemplary teamwork of eric davenport don florea and beth huber and a great venue to have it this is just another example of how seriously abx air takes its stewardship responsibilities this is a great community and we are proud to be a part of it
3040496 dont stop this train dont for a minute change the place youre in and dont think i couldnt ever understand i tried my hand john honestly well never stop this train
3040497 when i began investigating and documenting the history of prabhupadas books in 2003 it seemed more important than ever
3040498 the bbt was increasingly under fire from within iskcon for their editorial changes defending themselves from criticisms which had little or nothing to do with reality
3040499 it will also include resources such as handwritten corrections and references that prabhupada used such as sridhara swamis srimad bhagavatam commentaries and dr radhakrishnans gita
3040500 devotees working on srila prabhupadas books will be able to compare everything and understand how the editions we have now developed over the years
3040501 these are accompanied by infor mation on how to understand editorial changes who made them when they were made and how accurate or inaccurate they were
3040502 there were gorgeous orchards and gardens all around and the whole city was encircled by cannons so that no enemy could enter very easily
3040503 despite the recent attacks on the editors for making changes
3040504 its a fact that the bbts highest priority is always to bring the books closer to what prabhupada originally meant
3040505 and often without background history and information to help you understand what prabhupada wanted to say its hard to reflect the mood intended in a different language a translator shouldnt have to guess if he doesnt understand it that means the reader has no chance
3040506 prabhupadas works have such value for iskcon and the bbt and are already the topic of major heated discussions
3040507 those who remember how they were put together wont be here for much longer some like hayagriva have already left us and thats why this project must be done immediately if we wait too long future generations will not be able to understand from this material what we can understand now
3040508 there should be plenty of meteors perhaps one to two every minute
3040509 we began this year with a 26 million deficit and so that was a challenge that weve had to deal with as well
3040510 so we feel like the mayors going to be introducing a budget that will reflect his priorities and his goals
3040511 it is important for us to be responsible when it comes to spending taxpayers money and not everyone can be happy or ever will be happy but governing is about priorities and this budget will reflect the mayors priorities
3040512 and the lord god said unto the woman what is this thou hast done
3040513 hillary 08 but it was okay because we looked like this
3040514 i hope you dont mind if we start before this gets cold
3040515 because herbs and spices have a very low calorie content and are relatively inexpensive theyre a great way to get a lot of antioxidant and anti inflammatory power into your diet
3040516 if you set up a good herb and spice cabinet and season your food liberally you could double or even triple the medicinal value of your meal without increasing the caloric content
3040517 culinary herbs and spices are all generally recognized as safe and have been time tested in the diet
3040518 indeed some of spices and herbals are now sold as food supplements because of their recognized health benefits
3040519 when you add herbs and spices to food you definitely provide yourself with additional benefits besides taste
3040520 when the young prophet samuel heard the voice of god calling to him in the night he had the counsel from his priestly mentor elie to tell him how to respond even so it took them three times to realize it was god calling rather than ignoring the voice or rebuking it samuel finally listened in our modern pragmatic world we often have no such mentor so we do not understand it is god speaking to us in our heart having so long been out of touch with our deepest longing we fail to recognize the voice and the one who is calling to us through it frustrated by our hearts continuing sabotage of a dutiful christian life some of us silence the voice of god by locking our heart away in the attic feeding it only bread and water out of duty and obligation until it is almost dead the voice now small and weak but sometimes in the night when our defenses are down we still hear it call to us oh so faintly a distant whisper come morning the new days activities scream for our attention the sound of the cry is gone and we congratulate ourselves on finally overcoming the flesh others of us agree to give our heart a life on the side if it will only leave us alone and not rock the boat we try to lose ourselves in our work or get a hobby either which soon begins to feel lke an addiction we have an affair or develop a colorful fantasy life fed by dime store romances or pornography we learn to enjoy the juicy intrigues and secrets of gossip we make sure to maintain enough distance between ourselves and others and even between ourselves and our own heart to keep hidden the practical agnosticism we are living now that our inner life has been divorced from our outer life having thus appeased our heart we nonetheless are forced to give up our spiritual journey because our heart will no longer come with us it is bound up in th little indulgences we feed it to keep it at bay
3040521 this is the truth of this nation today we take care of everyone except the white and black middle class working men and women we are being exterminated go to your local store go to get gas take your kid to the baby doctor take a look at your surgery doctors look at your landscapers workers go into the chicken plants almost everywhere you turn we are being bombarded by this why cheap labor to make owners wealthier at the expense of the average working class family this country has forgotten who it is this is a dangerous road to travel in case everyone has over looked it the economy here locally is in the shitter box there is no work for a vast majority of middle class buisnesses i know because i have owned one for fifteen years the construction industry has died not that it matters because for the last four or five years it was taken over by illegal mexicans that built some of the most slapped toghter pieces of shit you have ever seen the whole nation is so obsessed with being politicaly correct dont affend anyone im sick of it im personally ready to explode and shove it right up the elites asses this is our country we built it we defended it we love it and i think alot of us are going to have to die again to save it all i want to know is where do i show up
3040522 many daughters have done worthily but thou excellest them all
3040523 i didnt take it very seriously i guess everything the president does is interesting
3040524 the colours of these nimbus beauties ranged from featherly light whites to raging scarlet reds and gave the audience that
3040525 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
3040526 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
3040527 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
3040528 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
3040529 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
3040530 alain is wounded when you are the last swimmer in a relay and that you have the opportunity to bring a title of this importance to your country you dont get out of this unhurt
3040531 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3040532 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
3040533 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her
3040534 but i got a bronze yesterday and a silver this morning if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
3040535 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
3040536 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
3040537 thierry meyssan linternet est d j un champ de bataille au sens militaire du terme
3040538 we have neutralized the their offensive front with tanks and missiles and eliminated any threat through the air with a concentrated assault on their defenses there was little challenge in the matter for us
3040539 surrender bulldogs of georgia before we run out of the mercy we have displayed thus far
3040540 bad but im from liberia so its all relative holding steady near viliskinsk send muscle milk ripped fuel and protein bars good on ammo
3040541 they have stepped on my face with hobnailed boots and broken my nose literally the gators are one thing but these guys are if youll pardon my french real assholes
3040542 this kind of thing happens with out of conference games you want to play the best you want to test yourself against the same guys who shocked the world at stalingrad and at kursk well grow as a team because of this well learn well get through the rest of our sec schedule provided we can recover our team from the piles of rubble theyre currently hiding under
3040543 i knew we had a tough schedule but russia i didnt even know they had a team
3040544 this is what happens when you leave the south i told my friends this would happen
3040545 they torched us through the air russians cant even make concrete right much less throw a football just imagine what rudy carpenter will do to us
3040546 they were much faster and stronger than georgia expected and really put pressure on the front four with their rushing attack
3040547 send muscle milk ripped fuel and protein bars good on ammo
3040548 porque usted lo pidi regresan los programas nocturnos va ser en vivo as que invitamos a todos vengan al estudio para bailar y recordar esta poca
3040549 we would like to give you a grant for 13 000 could you submit a proposal to me by the end of the day tomorrow
3040550 our client roster inspired us to launch this analysis series due to our customers unique positions in the advertising ecosystem they are us based but also global in the scope regarding their paid search advertising programs so they tend not to be retailers or ecommerce vendors who focus on one geographic region
3040551 it is very exciting for us to be able to observe first hand such trends as the bucking of the biggest losing streak in the paid search market the loss of market share by yahoo to google
3040552 love never dies a natural death it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of withering of tarnishing
3040553 mr ts real name is laurence tureaud but do not utter it ever

3040557 listen carefully you jump count to 3 and pull your rip cord if that doesnt work pull the cord on your reserve chute there will be a truck down there to pick you up
3040558 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
3040559 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
3040560 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
3040561 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
3040562 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
3040563 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
3040564 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
3040565 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
3040566 you crossed the line first sir you squeezed them you hammered them to the point of desperation and in their desperation they turned to a man they didnt fully understand
3040567 this war has pushed georgia further away not just from europe but also complicates the nato council in december
3040568 italy maintains that we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe and on this point we are close to russian prime minister vladimir putins position
3040569 but this makes nato expansion much less likely the last thing the united states needs now is another front thats exactly what russia is taking advantage of
3040570 saakashvili is playing his media game for the conscience of the western world the price is high but he is very convincing
3040571 no one in nato wants to be dragged into a war in the caucasus because of saakashvilis miscalculation
3040572 he is on his way to the region i dont know if he has landed yet he will be part of the mediation effort
3040573 clearly any overhaul would require the president working with congress and leaders of both parties
3040574 we ought to regulate the financial institutions by what theyre doing rather than by who they are
3040575 with far too little attention paid to the issues raised by the bear stearns rescue and the current financial crisis
3040576 access to the discount window is by its nature temporary you only do it when everything else goes wrong and its a last resort
3040577 we have seen that in a moment of crisis institutions that never anticipated being able to access the discount window like investment banks have been given access
3040578 even hardened free market types know that you cannot set up a situation where we know that if everything truly goes wrong we will once again open the discount window but not keep an eye on your behavior in the run up to that time
3040579 it doesnt have to be the fed necessarily but it needs to be someone
3040580 if youre going be able to access the discount window there need to be capital requirements there needs to be oversight into how much risk that you take
3040581 these are totally sensible reforms to prevent systemic risks to the financial system
3040582 if done in the proper international context i dont foresee that driving u s business offshore
3040583 if anything it undermines the innovations when financial market players are operating in a totally wild west environment
3040584 those dont have to be the same for banks and investment banks
3040585 they are different businesses there are different risk profiles and threats to the system
3040586 to the extent that some financial institutions are too big to fail that means they pose some systemic risk
3040587 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3040588 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3040589 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody
3040590 hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife
3040591 es war der erste treffer bei unserem olympischen auftritt daran werde ich mich immer erinnern

3040593 endspiel gegen deutschland wer verliert kann gleich nach hause gehen
3040594 die aufregung spannung und ungewissheit im vorfeld war einfach verr ckt
3040595 ich bin irgendwie froh dass dieses spiel vorbei ist das drumherum war einfach zu viel
3040596 er kam zu uns und sagte ich unterst tze euch die nation unterst tzt euch also geht raus und tretet in ein paar hintern
3040597 es war schwer f r uns konditionell und physisch sind die usa uns berlegen
3040598 dieses spiel hat uns trotzdem sehr geholfen meine jungs konnten eine menge lernen
3040599 multicultural markets have been showing growth over the past few years in an automotive market that has been in decline
3040600 the u s census bureau projects that hispanics african americans and asians will comprise 33 2 percent of the u s population by 2010 and 36 7 percent by 2020
3040601 automotive manufacturers cannot afford to ignore the growing importance of multicultural markets including paying close attention to their loyalty
3040602 many manufacturers are already increasing their focus on marketing and connecting with these markets through non traditional avenues like scholarships and supporting community activities
3040603 its important for oems and their supporting agencies to measure the performance of these programs against their marketing goals
3040604 quite frankly we are looking for tourists from outside the area to come
3040605 i think most people after 9 or 10 p m wouldnt want to be in downtown with their family
3040606 we are part of a team the business owners and the cops
3040607 there was no economic news monday the dollar is holding and oil is not doing much of anything
3040608 as a result the bond market is experiencing a spillover from last weeks auctions
3040609 before an auction the market always reacts to the state of the economy and inflation

3040611 i knew that last 15 to 20 meters would be out of control i was sitting there on the blocks saying the f word and then jason did what he did i dont think anyone in the world could have done it better
3040612 whether youre a reader swept away by a story or a writer creating those sweeping stories in todays busy world more than ever before we all need stories that strike deep chords i help others write the stories they need to tell
3040613 this years carfax 250 will be the best yet in its three year history
3040614 we get to make a wish come true for eric a nascar and country music lover who kicks off the race with pat green nascar fans will be treated to an electrifying race and fun filled day that brings out the kid in all of us
3040615 in the years weve been conducting this study weve never seen such dramatic year over year shifts in the rankings of the six domestic and foreign domestic automakers
3040616 this could signal a new chapter in oem supplier relations going forward
3040617 chryslers showing is especially unfortunate fifteen years ago chrysler was clearly ranked no 1 by suppliers but today has fallen rather dramatically to last place since being taken over by cerberus
3040618 last year gms largest suppliers indicated that they were sharing new technology without the assurance of a purchase order and investing in new technology in anticipation of future business to the greatest extent in many years because of improved relations with gm this year chryslers suppliers tell us that they have significantly pulled back in both of these areas because of worsening relations with chrysler
3040619 the two year drop of worsening supplier relations at chrysler has resulted in suppliers treating chrysler as chrysler has been treating them in todays poor economy and intense competitive environment such behavior toward suppliers by chrysler just doesnt make sense
3040620 now is not the time to take an adversarial approach to working with suppliers every automaker should be striving to work in a more trusting way with its suppliers so that it can take full advantage of the benefits they offer and strengthen its marketplace advantage suppliers simply respond in kind and chrysler is paying the price
3040621 supplier working relations within each oem vary among the various purchasing areas indicating that it is the oem personnel who have the day to day responsibility of working with suppliers who are the primary determinants of the companys supplier relations this indicates the importance of having performance metrics in place to drive the desired behavior of these individuals
3040622 the challenges of rampant increases in material costs poor economic conditions and increasingly intensive competition require that each oem works more closely than ever with its suppliers to maximize its chances for success
3040623 the turmoil in supplier relations among all of the oem implies that purchasing vps who know better have forgotten this fundamental premise of supplier relations
3040624 you can learn more about clean diesel vehicles on belle isle and see for yourself that todays diesel passenger vehicles are fuel efficient clean and provide drivers with greater performance than comparable gasoline vehicles we call this diesel advantage good clean fun

3040643 there is no doubt that economic and environmental factors are significantly changing which vehicles individuals buy and even more interestingly the types of vehicles they choose to purchase again
3040644 our data has shown that hybrid manufacturers have a clear advantage in reaching and keeping the more loyal vehicle buyers on the road today
3040645 this is not about removing anything from the classroom although that would probably be the ideal for me but this is about us having equality of access to other views as to how the world came into existence and that i think is a very very important issue for many parents in northern ireland

3040673 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3040681 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3040682 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3040683 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3040684 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3040686 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels

3040688 the story is told of the famous german organic chemist auguste k kul who was struggling with the problem of how the six carbon atoms of benzene were linked together he was getting nowhere with the problem and one day fell asleep in front of the fireplace while he was pondering on it he dreamt of molecules twisting and turning around like snakes suddenly one of the snakes swallowed its own tail and rolled around like a hoop k kul woke up with a start and realized that his problem could be solved if the six carbon atoms of benzene were attached to each other to form a ring further work showed that this was entirely correct
3040689 the creative process is believed to take place in five
3040690 the intersection of invention and insight leading to the creation of social and economic value
3040691 the development of new ideas and their economic application as new products or processes
3040692 though the outcomes of successful innovations appear random the processes that result in their success often are not

3040698 this time away from the pressures of the racetrack has been pretty short but it has allowed me to think things through and the conclusion is that the results during the first half of the year are well below what im capable of
3040699 i know that i can finish higher up the order on the ninja zx rr and weve seen this a couple of times already but i need to be finishing in the top ten more consistently during the second half of the season

3040708 my team and i think there are some great dedicated mobile email devices out there but were biased because half of us helped build one of them unfortunately the rest of the worlds 1 1 billion email users have phones with unusable hard to configure in built email that few people can be bothered to set up with bluewhalemail weve gone back to the drawing board so that people can keep the phone they like and still stay in touch on the go

3040717 strong results from our international businesses new business and pricing helped to partially offset the impact of substantially higher raw material costs and the weak u s economy
3040718 some countries dont have enough need for airlift to purchase their own c 17s
3040719 in an ideal situation the c 17 can go a distance of 2 400 kilometers and up to 28 000 feet and can land on a short runway as long as its strong
3040720 the c 17 was designed around the cargo load it can convert to airline or cargo seats it can handle a combination of passengers vehicles track vehicles cargo medical evacuations hummers fire trucks helicopters an abrams tank up to 80 000 metric tons
3040721 initially there will only be u s personnel manning the c 17s
3040722 but with training the countries will be able to use their own pilots crew aircraft commanders and loadmasters it will take a year and a half to train the countries crew and for them to be comfortable with the c 17 to fly on their own
3040723 you dont think youll ever be good enough and then youre able to go the olympics and actually win and thats the epitome of everything you ever thought about or dreamed about the army gave me that opportunity i would never have realized anywhere near what i accomplished without that
3040724 we had a local smallbore rifle league a target shooting league and thats how i learned from the men on the team and the other shooters in the league
3040725 i set a goal for myself way back then that i wanted to go as far as i could
3040726 was the only one that provided the opportunity to train and be supported to the level you needed to be to able to compete at the world level
3040727 i had goals and dreams to someday get good enough that i could make the olympic team but i was in the army for two years and never progressed that far
3040728 i thought that was the only medal id ever win
3040729 they needed people then and they said that if i signed on the dotted line because id only been gone six months i could come back in the army
3040730 so i called and asked where would you send me
3040731 i went back in one day after president kennedy was assassinated
3040732 we drove through dallas and by the bookstore and right by where he was killed and i went back to the unit and started training again
3040733 it seemed like every time i practiced i shot better
3040734 inside of a year i had gone from nothing to winning a gold medal pretty unusual but most of it was due to getting my new rifle and learning how to shoot it and learning how to it all came together
3040735 i had two tours in vietnam 1967 and 1971 and i look at those tours as two of the best years of my life because i was able to give something back to the military
3040736 i am very patriotic and maybe i look at that type of thing differently but i think the way of life in the military and what it teaches you makes you a better person i know it works it worked for me
3040737 i didnt think there was any chance i would be selected
3040738 i never gained any notoriety for winning a gold medal
3040739 its just a matter of performing at the top level on the particular day that theyre competing getting everything together focusing on what theyre doing and performing on that particular day
3040740 some may and some probably wont its not a gimme youve got to earn it
3040741 shooting in olympics is a little different than anything else
3040742 there is a lot of pressure and people have a tendency to back into it and say im going to do best i can you have to face the olympics head on and you have to think about it you have to convince yourself that you can win by thinking about it every day and putting yourself on firing line and going through it in your mind what youre going to do learn to accept youll be at the olympic games and will be performing the level it takes to win
3040743 you have to think about performing well performing at the level you want to and you have to think this is the olympics and picture yourself on the awards stand with a medal around your neck with the national anthem playing
3040744 once you convince your subconscious that youre capable of winning youre almost there
3040745 in close contact with senior russian and georgian officials were urging moscow to press south ossetias de facto leaders to stop firing
3040746 we call for an immediate end to the violence and for direct talks between the parties
3040747 its important that both sides stop firing that they sit down and they discuss this in a peaceful manner

3040755 the operations in basra really instituted the rule of law there
3040756 the people there are able to live freely again without intimidation and extortion by militias
3040757 what you saw and what youre seeing now in mosul and diyala is a more determined enemy in terms of holding ground
3040758 al qaida is still a viable threat and its not so much theyve given up
3040759 the coalition iraqi security forces and political process have made it much harder to for al qaida to operate in iraq
3040760 the iraqis are really developing and have come a long way
3040761 it takes a while to develop the kind of leadership theyve shown were focusing on that key leadership and bolstering them so we have a vibrant and successful counterinsurgency force

3040901 the heart of a renegade is a skillfully crafted novel packed with complex characters involved in a well used plot line however it is innovatively done loreth anne whites pacing is superb maintaining ever mounting intensity as the story plays out this story is rich with detail and a plot that could be expanded to a 450 page hardcover that said it does not feel as if it were condensed but evolves in the expected manner only to twist and turn a bit adding interest and suspense the dynamics between jessica and luke are extraordinarily well handled white is a very gifted author and whose future novels will be sought out by this reviewer
3040902 if we can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretence of taking care of them they must become happy
3040903 politics has its puzzling moments john mccain and most of the gop experienced one late last week that was when five of their own set about dismantling the best issue republicans have in the upcoming election its taken time but sen mccain and his party have finally found in energy an issue thats working for them riding voter discontent over high gas prices the gop has made antidrilling democrats this summers headlines their enthusiasm has given conservative candidates a boost in tough races and mr mccain has pressured barack obama into an energy debate where the democrat has struggled to explain shifting and confused policy proposals still it was probably too much to assume every republican would work out that their side was winning this issue and so on 1 august in stumbled sens lindsey graham john thune saxby chambliss bob corker and johnny isakson alongside five senate democrats this gang of 10 announced a sweeping and bipartisan energy plan to break washingtons energy stalemate what they did was throw every vulnerable democrat and mr obama a life preserver thats because the plan is a democratic giveaway new production on offshore federal lands is left to state legislatures and then in only four coastal states the regulatory hurdles are huge and the bill bars drilling within 50 miles of the coast putting off limits some of the most productive areas alaskas oil rich arctic national wildlife refuge is still a no go the highlight is instead 84 billion in tax credits subsidies and federal handouts for alternative fuels and renewables the gang of 10 intends to pay for all this in part by raising taxes on oil companies the sierra club couldnt have penned it better and so the republican five has potentially given antidrilling democrats the political cover they need to neutralize energy through november
3040904 barack obama remains opposed to new offshore drilling although he now says he would accept a highly restricted version as part of a comprehensive package just recently he claimed that if only americans would inflate their tires properly and get regular tune ups we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling this is bizarre by any reasonable calculation of annual tire inflation and tune up savings the outer continental shelf holds nearly a hundred times as much oil as for oil shale also under federal moratorium after a thousand years of driving with obama inflated tires and obama tuned engines we would still have saved only one fifth the oil shale available in the united states
3040905 its always good to take a break from the madding crowd but especially now that american politics has surpassed itself in self mockery after four days avoiding television blogs youtube and cell phones it is possible to wonder how we get so exercised about the insignificant not that politics isnt important the debate about what role government should play in our lives is no small thing and while we cant all kick back at once and hope that our enemies work out their anger issues a little perspective is salutary and productive in a fallow field kind of way the family is what gives our life meaning and makes our nation strong the family is also what keeps government at a respectful distance working for us and not the other way around all our political choices should be made in the service of that understanding thats all and weve got work to do
3040906 mapping america a project cataloguing the societal effects of the family and church has found that adolescents from broken homes are much more likely to use hard drugs according to data from the national longitudinal sample of adolescent health of adolescents who live with married or cohabiting parents or with an always single parent up to 11 have used hard drugs when their living environment has been disrupted however that number shoots up 15 for adolescents living with divorcees 18 for those in stepfamilies and 19 for those living with one biological parent in a cohabiting relationship divorce and parental separation increase both the likelihood of trying drugs and the amount of drug addiction and intravenous use according to the centers for disease control and prevention fourteen year olds of divorced parents are nearly four times more likely to try illegal drugs and twice as likely to use them as adults what can be done sometimes not always but sometimes complex problems can be addressed with simple solutions in the case of teenager and pre teenager drug abuse a little bit of faith can go a long way
3040907 i have always believed that america is strongest and freest and happiest when it is truest to the wisdom of its founders in federalist 45 james madison wrote that the powers delegated by the constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state government are numerous and indefinite or to put it another way we the people as long as we remember these words we the people and make them our guide so long as we remember that america has always drawn its inspiration from the people and has always been governed best when governed most by those governments closest to the people america will remain strong and free the envy of the world
3040908 edgar k browning professor of economics at texas a amp m university has a new book aptly titled stealing from each other its subtitle how the welfare state robs americans of money and spirit goes to the heart of what the book is about the rise of equalitarian ideology has driven americans to steal from one another browning explains that certain kinds of equality have been a cherished value in america equality under the law and within reason equality of opportunity is consistent with a free society equality of results is an anathema to a free society and within it lie the seeds of tyranny browning reminds us of the biblical admonition thou shalt not steal government income redistribution programs produce the same result as theft in fact thats what a thief does he redistributes income the difference between government and thievery is mostly a matter of legality brownings solution is captured in the title of his last chapter just say no where he proposes the federal government shall not adopt any policies that transfer income resources from some americans to other americans he agrees with james madison the father of our constitution who said i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents

3040978 based on the recent lca study and model developed at the university of california santa barbara implementation of more efficient powertrain systems elevates the importance of the emissions from material production placing greater emphasis on selecting a low greenhouse gas intensive material such as steel
3040979 compared to other materials used to reduce vehicle weight these advanced high strength steels produce five to 15 times less greenhouse gas emissions during the material manufacturing phase which greatly reduces a vehicles life cycle carbon footprint
3040980 were not just looking at the vehicle design and its impact on ghg at the tailpipe
3040981 were concerned with the whole life cycle of the vehicle from the emissions produced and energy used to create raw materials all the way to the impact of recycling if the whole life cycle is not taken into account there is the distinct possibility of having a net increase in greenhouse gasses if the wrong material choice is made this isnt just speculation we have very clear models that demonstrate this

3040996 the take home message here is its a big deal
3040997 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
3040998 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
3040999 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully
3041000 we think we can make people feel cooler more quickly feel comfortable more quickly and that will translate into less power in the central ac system
3041001 julius is going to explore nba veterans camp and the chances are he could be tied up until mid october
3041002 then they introduced baby jabba aka rotta the huttlet aka stinky
3041003 if you dont pay attention and dont get involved it will be your own backyard your own child being affected
3041004 i cant believe they would be so stupid its just provocative
3041005 people would notice what he was doing people would be aware of him doing it i know what people are doing in my lab even if he wanted to be sneaky about it people would know that things were done
3041006 i just heard tonight that bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
3041007 osama bin laden has just decreed death to all jews and all americans
3041008 language similar to the text of the anthrax letters postmarked two weeks later warning death to america death to israel
3041009 this is next take penacilin sic now death to america death to israel allah is great
3041010 were fighting them there so we dont have to fight them over here
3041011 the government is still searching for evidence that bruce ivins was solely responsible for the 2001 anthrax attacks despite declaring the case solved
3041012 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
3041013 i just want to know if your athletes would listen to the uss anthem or that of the virgin islands
3041014 all i know is we aint gonna win no gold medal
3041015 the uks was the first real national anthem in 1745 and it was adopted by dozens of other countries sweden germany even russia at one point the idea developed that it was only the words that were important in expressing national character the tune to god save the queen was seen as meaning national anthem and the words were what made it appropriate to each country
3041016 countries use anthems to put themselves on the world stage
3041017 we only have six athletes going to beijing and they didnt actually qualify
3041018 psychologically it was very difficult for us to play in this game because these guys james bryant are heroes to some of our players
3041019 it was a silent witness not only to the battle but to the burials the dedication of the cemetery the reunions and everything that has happened since
3041020 when you lose a witness tree that you know was here at the time of the civil war you are losing a living part of the battlefield its sad but nothing lasts forever
3041021 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
3041022 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
3041023 driving the r8 is like smearing honey into keira knightly
3041024 in principle this car is too fast for my thoughts
3041025 we are in a tough pool and have to win every game so i am definitely happy to win this one
3041026 i cant be happy when we missed so many goals it is unacceptable at the start of the tournament we had seven penalty corners and wasted all of them
3041027 it makes it difficult for us now but we will fight all the way
3041028 i am not surprised we had problems getting into the game at the start
3041029 then i thought thats ridiculous this is an olympic games you have to go for it
3041030 jason finished that race way better than we could have even asked for
3041031 the last 10 to 15 metres were incredible i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional after that
3041032 he won at the world championships and i won here hes a powerful competitor the same as the other medallists
3041033 i tried to forget about it but the fight ended so quickly that i cant say it had any effect on my performance
3041034 ive dreamt of this all my life i really believed i could do it and i did
3041035 billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours
3041036 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time
3041037 we are missing the best player in the world in tiger woods the pressure will be more on them for the first time europe is going to have everything to lose
3041038 even though they have won five of the last six ryder cups they have come in as underdogs i dont know how that works but this time it will be different
3041039 the top eight guys earned their spots and for many of them the ryder cup was foremost on their minds this weekend
3041040 the way this system was set up is to reward players who play well in the pga championship ben didnt lose pga championship padraig harrington went out and won it
3041041 experience is important but we have lost five of last six ryder cups so their experiences are bad experiences
3041042 these are the best us players we have got here i am really glad i didnt have to pick four players this morning i could have got burned by it now i have three weeks more weeks to make those picks
3041043 i am looking forward to calling woods to see how he feels i want his input
3041044 i dont see any positives in not having tiger on the team it puts us in a difficult spot
3041045 i have a lot of stuff i have written down a lot of stuff that has gone on that nobody knows about
3041046 the guys showed a lot of character after the second test we have been consistent in recent years at home as well as away the younger players took responsibility and the seniors pushed themselves
3041047 both murali muttiah muralitharan and ajantha mendis bowled very well and kept the pressure on a good indian batting line up
3041048 i have rarely seen so many injuries on a single day but it is part of the game sri lanka played better and deserved the victory
3041049 our batting let us down as it was not consistent throughout the series mendis was a key bowler for sri lanka and was well supported by murali
3041050 today after fridays big advance some pullback is only normal
3041051 my goal is to try to get the number one ranking back
3041052 i need to play well again i need to win the big matches thats what im looking at at the moment
3041053 i wanted to go to the market today but we have to play so many matches
3041054 ive been on pain killers for the last six days i took four this morning
3041055 its unfortunate timing its very bad but theres nothing i can do
3041056 the tools will be finalized at the same time that the new linux platform becomes available
3041057 for a number of reasons berkshires results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be relatively more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year variations in the amounts and timing of investment gains losses can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings investment gains losses are recorded when investments are sold other than temporarily impaired or in instances as required under gaap when investments are marked to market in addition changes in the fair value of derivative assets liabilities associated with derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings
3041058 why shouldnt the university of liberia and other institutions of higher learning accept our students when high profile universities around the world including harvard are accepting our credits
3041059 our 37 all cash proposal clearly offers republic stockholders a better and more certain value alternative than is contemplated in the republic allied transaction
3041060 we believe our proposal is clearly superior for republics stockholders and is designed so we can work cooperatively with republic to structure a transaction that would benefit both republic and waste management stockholders
3041061 the most honest description of algal biofuels ive witnessed in the financial community
3041062 it wasnt an overdose i had a bad experience it was nowhere near an overdose it was blown completely out of proportion i never overdosed
3041063 drugs for me are something i dont normally meddle in i have tried drugs in my life im not going to deny it but i dont need to go to rehab because i never and will never have any sort of habit with drugs
3041064 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
3041065 if i was independently wealthy and i didnt need an income i would do this for nothing thats how much i love it
3041066 they can be very dangerous animals if you dont know what youre doing

3041071 tierra que la forestales las adquirieron bajo leyes de la dictadura de pinochet a costa de negarle el derechos hist rico sobre la tierra a las comunidades mapuche
3041072 valorar lo alcanzado producto una lucha que muchos han pagados con c rceles y condena inesperada pero que nada es en vano por que la unidad de todas la luchas sociales en alg n momento de nuestra historia derrotara al sistema opresor neoliberal y pasada las elecciones municipales de octubre viviremos un chile distinto y nosotros la izquierda lo mapuche seguiremos avanzando en un proyecto de sociedad que contemple definitivamente nuestro territorio y autonom a

3041085 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3041086 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3041087 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3041088 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3041089 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3041090 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3041091 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3041092 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3041093 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3041094 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

3041098 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3041099 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3041100 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

3041225 is attempting to dictate both when employers can consult with their lawyers and what advice the lawyers can give
3041226 in the last two months the department has barred attorney client consultations about specialized questions of immigration law and has attempted to bias the advice attorneys must give their clients when confronted with questions about the permanent labor certification program administered by the departments office of foreign labor certification
3041227 to invalidate rescind and permanently enjoin actions by the united states department of labor
3041228 provide that employers may be represented by counsel throughout the labor certification process experienced and knowledgeable immigration attorneys help employers navigate and complicate with this often confusing and complicated process
3041229 the department has recently announced a radical and unprecedented new interpretation of its regulations
3041230 specifically the department now asserts that during recruitment conducted for a labor certification application an employer in some situations may not consult with its counsel about whether particular applicants for a position are qualified under the complicated criteria established by the regulations which deviate substantially from normal hiring standards
3041231 under the departments new view if the employer makes a preliminary assessment that an applicant appears
3041232 based on its new interpretation of the regulations the department announced a 100 percent audit of all labor certification applications filed by plaintiff on behalf of its clients
3041233 the departments actions exceed its statutory authority violate the constitutional rights of employers to consult with their counsel and of counsel to provide advice to their clients and contravene the regulation the department purports to be implementing these actions also seek to force attorneys to breach ethical duties they owe to clients violate plaintiffs due process right to pursue its vocation and depart from decades of settled practice in immigration law in addition the department promulgated its new interpretation without notice and an opportunity for comment in violation of basic rulemaking requirements established by the administrative procedure act

3041246 for me i dont have a problem with the whole head turning thing they are machines and when introduced to something new how else would they regard it even the borg when faced with something new before they decide to assimilate it they observe it regard it in a similar way but they do more of a blank stare thing as a posed to the slight head tilt
3041247 as we got larger we wanted to be able work smarter in how we delivered our pricing to the point of sale
3041248 one of the key drivers was that during our peak sales periods we have less experienced sales staff so we wanted to take decision making away from the staff and let the system take control
3041249 it was really at the point where it was not actually working had we not been able to improve it there would have been some hard decisions to be made
3041250 one loss of a site because we missed a key date or it was typed incorrectly into something else could be pretty bad for our business
3041251 it was just hard yakka to physically look at all the sites every day and keep up with what was going on
3041252 we had 100 plus sites and a big spreadsheet that was completed with all the different headings in different colours
3041253 it used to be a two week task to add up our commitment for the remaining term of leases for audit purposes
3041254 now it takes us about five minutes just because weve streamlined some of the reports
3041255 it was a huge windfall at the end of the financial year to be able to do that
3041256 ten or 15 minutes as opposed to three weeks was a gigantic improvement
3041257 previously they would ring us wed have to sit down with them roll out the sheets of paper and pull out the files
3041258 weve been pulling a bit of demographic data from the leaseeagle system and the information on annual turnover for the centres sales figures etc
3041259 thats starting to build theres 12 months worth of data they can use to demonstrate store performance
3041260 that type of data doesnt accumulate overnight it takes a bit of time to build up but going into next year were going to have two years worth of trend information they can make some decisions on
3041261 they could have done for us for an additional fee but we had resources here and we wanted to familiarise ourselves with the system
3041262 the only thing we had to do then was scan and attach key documents into the system
3041263 synetek could have done it for us but it chose to take it on here and it has done that really well

3041267 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
3041268 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
3041269 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
3041270 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
3041271 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
3041272 our next step will be to obtain more structural information about how 14 3 3 shields gab2 once we know that it should be possible to design drugs to combat gab2 activated diseases in novel ways
3041273 we found a chemical reporter that detects a relatively rare event one that is related to the action of the toxin
3041274 our reporter probe shows that the reaction is taking place
3041275 when theres no toxin there will be no light emission
3041276 now that we have an assay that senses the toxins activity we can try to discover inhibitors of the toxin or antidotes
3041277 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
3041278 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
3041279 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
3041280 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders
3041281 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
3041282 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
3041283 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
3041284 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
3041285 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age

3041304 giving couples a popular fertility drug or a common form of insemination are no more effective than encouraging them to keep trying researchers said both treatments are officially recommended as one of the first courses of action for couples having trouble conceiving they are designed to improve fertility rates either by stimulating egg production in the ovaries or by injecting sperm directly into the womb but the study suggests that both have little or no effect on conception rates more than 21 000 couples a year receive the drug called clomifene citrate which has cost the nhs around 1 million over the last five years the human fertilisation and embryology authority which regulates fertility treatment in britain does not collect information on how many couples receive unstimulated intrauterine insemination iui but experts believe there are thousands of the treatments carried out every year at a cost of around 300 per cycle

3041311 these cats are being left to die it is very inhumane
3041312 people dont want to keep cats in beijing any more so they abandon them or send them to the compounds
3041313 when we went inside we saw about 70 cats being kept in cages stacked one on top of the other in two tiny rooms
3041314 disease spreads quickly among them and they die slowly in agony and distress the government wont even do the cats the kindness of giving them lethal injections when they become sick they just wait for them to die
3041315 it is the abandoned pets that suffer the most and die the soonest they relied so much on their owners that they cant cope with the new environment
3041316 most refuse to eat or drink and get sick more quickly than the feral cats
3041317 we do not believe any of the cats that go in there survive
3041318 we have tried to negotiate with the government to stop the round ups and to introduce cut price neutering services so that people can afford to keep their pets but they wont listen to us
3041319 they are not thinking about the cats they just want to get results in the quickest way possible by clearing as many cats from the city as they can
3041320 if i dont take them in the government will kill them
3041321 people believe what the government tells them and that is why they are abandoning more and more family pets
3041322 he didnt like dogs so he decided to have dogs killed but there was a bad reaction from the foreign media and they were pressured to stop
3041323 now they have stopped killing dogs but the new victims are cats it is all connected to the olympics
3041324 when women get pregnant the doctor will ask them if they have a cat in the house
3041325 if they reply yes they tell them you must get rid of it it will be bad for the baby
3041326 i keep all the cats in my house and 100 of them sleep in my bedroom at night i am too frightened to let them out if they go outside they will be taken away and killed
3041327 the government is not telling people the truth look at me i live with them 24 hours a day seven days a week and i am very healthy
3041328 there are no cats here go away no one is allowed inside unless you have official permission
3041329 we did it out of love for the children we were worried the cats might harm them these six cats had been hanging around the kindergarten looking for food
3041330 so three male teachers put out plates of tuna in cages for bait trapped the cats and then beat them to death with sticks
3041331 we were very worried the children might try to stroke them and that the cats might scratch them or pass on diseases we had to get rid of the cats and this was the only way to do it
3041332 we understand that with the olympic games the beijing government is eager to show the world the city in a good light
3041333 but capturing and dealing with cats in such an inhumane way will seriously tarnish the image of beijing and the games

3041403 not sure how this improves the point but clearly there was negative feedback against the headline
3041404 mccain is so quick to pick up his gold colored cellphone to solicit advice from outsiders that aides concerned about his tendency to adopt the last opinion he has heard have tried to cut back on the time he has to make calls

3041415 it isnt easy you have to communicate a lot for it to work i mean sure i have buttons that can be pushed and i can get jealous like if he dates a petite blonde everything i am not its hard not to feel a little jealous but you talk about it work through it and grow so far its worked for us

3041417 going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice

3041505 will feels it was an injustice and he is down about the decision
3041506 the celtic player has a handful of hainings shirt and he actually loses his balance
3041507 i have watched the incident from various angles and i can see how eddie smith made the decision from the view that he had

3041510 what we do is look at video clips and dvds and look at the good bad and ugly part of the game to see what we want to improve upon

3041524 ive met with city staff this morning and ive directed a complete review of our zoning bylaws to determine whether there need to be changes with respect to the safety of facilities of this nature

3041578 es una sorpresa parece que los controles antidopaje en espa a no detectaron nada en sus pruebas en espa a antes del viaje de la atleta
3041579 when they start to change their behaviors and really focus only on that number on the scale only on their weight thats when it gets dangerous everything you do during pregnancy including your diet and exercise should be for your health not for your weight
3041580 calorie restriction is linked with growth retardation and birth defects and with vitamin deficiencies both for the mother and baby whats interesting about vitamin deficiencies is say for instance with calcium deficiency the baby will probably get what he or she needs but thatll be at the expense of the mothers bones so you really have to be careful with that
3041581 from the mothers mental and physical health to better deliveries better postpartum recoveries even a higher i q for the baby
3041582 but you dont want to overdo it you never want to exercise to the point where youre not getting enough oxygen because thats linked with neurological defects in the baby
3041583 you shouldnt exercise to the point of exhaustion if you need to throw yourself on the couch afterwards just to rejuvenate youve done too much you should feel invigorated after your workout not exhausted
3041584 i think weve never before been more kind of obsessed with celebrity culture and with celebrity pregnancies as well its not unusual to see pictures of these celebrities the day before and the day after birth and theyre looking super humanly fit theyre really incredible
3041585 but you also have to remember a lot of these celebrities are just genetically blessed they have the best dieticians nutritionists trainers etc they certainly have an advantage
3041586 so its sort of like passing money from your left pocket to your right pocket but i know enough about ottawa and ottawas digestive track to know that if you pass money through it it doesnt come out the same as it went in
3041587 its like a man who has a horse and feeds hay to the horse and stands under the back end of the horse hoping to get the same amount of hay out that he put in and it just doesnt happen so revenue neutral in terms of ottawa is a myth
3041588 first point a cease fire second access to the victims the third point is the withdrawal of the troops on both sides a controlled withdrawal of the troops it means that we need controllers watchers people in charge of and a fourth most important in a way the fourth point is of course comeback to the political process and it means that the european union at least and the osce both of them they are ready to do so but for the rest well see un involvement or not etcetera lets come back to the key of the problem the key is a political key certainly not a military key
3041589 we are really seeing an absolutely unparalleled situation since many many decades in the world
3041590 this is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine and its very unfortunate that it is happening in my country i insist that its happening unprovoked by us and i insist that it was all pre planned

3041593 j p losman is playing a lot more like trent edwards patiently hitting the underneath stuff he also displayed nice touch on a 16 yard touchdown to rookie receiver james hardy in the corner of the end zone
3041594 has the size and power to make an immediate impact as a change of pace or short yardage back in the nfl while his lack of breakaway speed does limit his big play capabilities hightower could surprise as a late round small school gem in a ball control offense
3041595 detroits first round pick tackle gosder cherilus had three penalties one for holding and two false starts and was booed by the crowd
3041596 meacham ran a spacing route created separation for a first down and then ran through the entire cardinals defense last night granted it was the preseason and he was up against their third string but it was incredible
3041597 donovan mcnabb looks sharp he looks five times better than he did last year desean jackson has caught a few balls and made some after the catch moves i like the idea that some 5 yard hitches might become 12 yard gains if not 60 yarders in general the eagles looked more together than they usually do in a first preseason game it looks like they realize the super bowl run was a few years ago and that they need work again they cannot just coast through the preseason

3041637 but it was very much a matter of the little sister being determined not to be outdone by her big sisters and she passed them soon enough
3041638 because of that early rivalry she has always had a competitive streak you could really tell that from the first moment she went in a pool
3041639 she wasnt even in the frame when it came to the last turn
3041640 we knew she has a very strong finish but we all thought she had left it too late
3041641 it looked like she would be lucky to get bronze but then it was as if she switched on her onboard motor she was just away it was simply fantastic

3041643 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
3041644 trust your gut instinct when those shopping decisions get tough say scientists

3041661 those who defend the law have argued that openly gay personnel harm military readiness this research highlights the absurdity of such a hypothesis not only are there more than 65 000 lesbians and gays serving in the armed forces but many are serving openly
3041662 their straight colleagues are just fine with that at a time when our fighting forces are stretched thin and leaders are calling for the recruitment of more troops it is time for congress to do away with this archaic law
3041663 it is clear that national attitudes toward this issue have evolved considerably in the last decade this has been led by a new generation of service members who take a more relaxed and tolerant view toward homosexuality
3041664 there has been a seismic shift among the military and the public in favor of welcoming gay patriots in our armed forces

3041793 i dont have to worry about listening to beatnik poetry or some political ideology that makes me want to vomit
3041794 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3041795 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3041796 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3041797 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
3041798 the lord of the rings the return of the king
3041799 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3041800 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3041801 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3041802 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3041803 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3041804 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3041805 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3041806 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3041807 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3041808 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3041809 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3041810 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3041811 it seemed so weird last time we spoke you admitted to a lifelong fear of condiments i dont want to get you upset
3041812 you know what really grinds my gears when i cant find the droids im looking for

3041853 potash posted earnings of 905 1 million 2 82 per share a 220 increase over the 88c per share earned in the same period of 2007 it was the highest quarterly profit in the companys history 62 above the previous record
3041854 as a result of these strong gains and the expectation of continued high demand the company again raised its earnings forecast for the full year this time to 12 13 per share for the third quarter net income is expected to be in the range of 3 25 3 75 per share
3041855 looking ahead we can expect more of the same demand for fertilizer nutrients remains strong china recently settled its 2008 potash contract prices at us 400 a metric ton higher than the 2007 levels
3041856 of course potash is an international commodity and we could see a price correction however the world food shortage is a real and growing threat everything points to continuing strength in the potash markets for the foreseeable future as countries ramp up food production
3041857 pots management is certainly confident the company recently announced large expansions at its allan cory and rocanville mines all scheduled for completion in 2012 given the outlook and rapidly rising earnings i think that potash has a lot of upside potential despite these difficult markets
3041858 the price drop has brought potash back into buying territory even an extremely conservative 12 5 multiple on forecasted earnings of about 22 a share in 2009 would provide an upside target of 275

3041970 in 2006 40 4 an estimated 71 5 million persons of u s adults aged 18 to 64 years reported ever being tested for hiv infection
3041971 in addition 10 4 an estimated 17 8 million persons reported being tested in the preceding 12 months and 23 of persons who acknowledged having hiv risk factors reported being tested in the preceding 12 months
3041972 the data in this report suggest that progress in hiv testing stalled in the mid to late 1990s and new strategies such as expanded screening in health care settings appear to be warranted
3041973 enables infected persons to obtain medical care that can improve the quality and length of their lives and adopt behaviors to prevent further hiv transmission
3041974 the quest to develop an aids vaccine is at a pivotal moment in the wake of the failure of a leading aids vaccine candidate nearly a year ago some have questioned whether we will ever have an aids vaccine
3041975 to these skeptics i say that developing an aids vaccine may take more time and innovation than we might have once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail the necessary direction for the field is clear and we must march forward future generations are counting on us to bring this epidemic to an end
3041976 twenty five years since the discovery of hiv as the cause of aids nearly 7 500 people continue to become infected with hiv each day
3041977 i am encouraged and inspired to see that iavis aids vaccine blueprint proposes a well defined roadmap to accelerate the development of a critical tool for the elimination of this terrible disease
3041978 strong scientific evidence in both humans and animal models suggests that developing an aids vaccine is possible
3041979 the challenge we face now is how to translate advances made in our understanding of the virus and the human immune responses to it into promising vaccine candidates as quickly and safely as possible
3041980 the hiv vaccine research field is at a crossroads now is the time to integrate new ideas and new technologies from other areas of biomedical research to energize the field with a new generation of researchers and to undertake an ambitious program of research aimed at understanding the full complexity of the human immune response to hiv
3041981 iavis blueprint lays out a clear and realistic roadmap with intermediate milestones of important aspects of where the field needs to go over the next few years
3041982 developing a preventive hiv aids vaccine is going to be much tougher than we originally thought and we need as many people as possible committed to helping us reach this goal the world is now relying on the talents resources and energy of researchers donors policymakers activists and other stakeholders from both the developed and the developing world to help sustain this vital effort
3041983 weve come a long way in aids vaccine discovery and development but recognize that theres a long road ahead and there will be further bumps on that road iavis blueprint is intended to stimulate debate within the field that we hope will generate consensus on the most promising way forward
3041984 we at iavi will keep using speed flexibility and focus to drive forward aids vaccine science and testing and to keep an aids vaccine on the center stage as a long term solution to this devastating public health problem

3041986 we are proud that moody s has upgraded the city and county of san francisco s bond rating
3041987 this rating is a statement about the strong fiscal health of san francisco but we must remain steadfast in our commitment to financial prudence and sound managerial practices in order to continue our terrific progress
3041988 among san franciscos strengths were an above average resident socioeconomic profile a highly diverse and robust revenue base an exceptionally strong balance sheet at close of fiscal year 2006 2007 and a moderate debt burden with relatively rapid direct debt retirement
3041989 there is a need for sexuality education that goes beyond teaching the basic biology
3041990 society should not be afraid of young people having sex it is a reality
3041991 a new national curriculum on sex education tells young people what not to do sexually without telling them why or explaining to them the most basic things such as how intercourse happens
3041992 teaching about the risk of hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases is necessary but it must go hand in hand with teaching about healthy sexuality and communicating with young people about their experiences

3041994 much of the immediate prognosis for the euro will depend on mr trichets answers to questions about the eurozone economy strict inflation talk from mr trichet is expected but the more he acknowledges pending economic weakness or cooling inflation the more the markets will begin to price a rate cut
3041995 we are identifying downside risk for a number of months and i would say that the information that we have which are very very clear for some of them suggest the materialization of those risks
3041996 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee

3041999 are offended by the notion that they may be influenced by these minor offerings and theyre indignant at the notion that they would prescribe a drug simply because someone brought them a bagel but these drug companies are made up of very bright creative industrious individuals why would they spend millions of dollars on bagels and danishes each year if this strategy had no impact

3042005 also while i understand why those on your side of this argument like to spin the courts dismissal of the other counts besides stock manipulation as this huge blow to usana and victory for minkow this is not an accurate portrayal of the facts

3042021 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3042022 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3042023 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3042024 estamos a fazer um artigo curto sobre o crescente movimento de
3042025 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3042026 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3042027 que pregunta tan imb cil me dijo el muy putito antes de que yo terminara de preguntar

3042030 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3042031 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3042032 over the past few years i lived in a democratic society i was happy and now america and the european union are spitting on us
3042033 the proposed trans caspian oil and natural gas lines and the proposed nabucco line to europe
3042034 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3042035 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3042036 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3042037 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
3042038 today and tomorrow will never be as funny as yesterday without bernie mac a true original
3042039 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3042040 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
3042041 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3042042 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
3042043 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3042044 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
3042045 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
3042046 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
3042047 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try

3042049 the soulsville foundation which operates the stax museum of american soul music stax music academy and the soulsville charter school is so deeply saddened by the passing of isaac hayes that we are in state of shock
3042050 explanation of what problems were identified and give the applicant a chance to respond to that
3042051 vendors need to name their products theres no question about that and theres unfortunately product specific taxonomy but broad terms like cloud computing those are canvasses that we should all be able to paint our piece of the mural on
3042052 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
3042053 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others

3042056 if you have a federal registration it gives you some legal presumptions and benefits you dont have otherwise
3042057 youre presumed the nationwide exclusive owner of the goods that you have marks registered for
3042058 were an enabler for the cloud computing businesses so wed have a hard time talking about the space were in and the specific product we deliver
3042059 rather than thinking about what a customer needs marketers have to think long and hard about the words they use what a waste of time
3042060 the lord of the rings the return of the king
3042061 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3042062 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3042063 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3042064 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3042065 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3042066 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3042067 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3042068 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3042069 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3042070 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3042071 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3042072 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work

3042095 we are pleased with the terms of our amended facility with our lending partner rbs business capital
3042096 this facility should give us the flexibility to repurchase the debentures and to support our growth efforts over the next several years

3042109 exceedingly pleased with these results which confirm the systems and procedures that we have implemented work
3042110 throughout my career i have helped companies understand how to harness the power of innovation and translate process improvements into bottom line results

3042152 performing plantings is a never ending process unless the causes of plant losses are understood and addressed
3042153 considering what is known about past species changes in inwood park and other new york city parks the new york city parks department natural resources group ecological restoration efforts would benefit from structured scientific research on plantings survival through partnerships with scientists who have studied the ecology of new york city parks
3042154 todays plantings for the ecological restoration of inwood park are similar to private estate plantings done following the american revolution period which have been decimated by subsequent use and management of the land
3042155 the forest and wetland communities of inwood hill park are more diverse and have a greater structural variation than revealed by previous research
3042156 considering the results of this research on the long term ecology of the inwood park forest the natural resources group could avoid the problem observed by spanish born american poet and philosopher george santayana those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3042157 our detector actually flew to the edge of outer space and then back to ground and the whole time it worked perfectly
3042158 the purpose of the grant is not only to develop instrumentation for use in space flight but also to promote student interest in science and engineering through experiments with high altitude balloons
3042159 the best part about the project is that the detector was built from everyday materials and launched into near space from right here in our own backyard this proves you can accomplish really amazing things with simple materials
3042160 we know from many clinical studies of patients and their families that our cells can tolerate a rather large amount of mutant mitochondrial dna with no significant loss of function
3042161 these new clinical measurements have given direct evidence for the widespread incidence of pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations in the human population these findings emphasize the pressing need to develop effective ways to interrupt the transmission of these mutations to the next generation
3042162 while many have thought that people wont be able to take medicines as well as they need to due to limited resources in poor countries our review of all studies on the topic strongly suggests that children in low income countries are able to maintain at least a comparable degree of art adherence if not better adherence than children in high income countries
3042163 healthcare systems need to carefully monitor how children with hiv take their medicines this kind of monitoring can be particularly difficult in low income countries so its very helpful for healthcare providers to understand how others do this monitoring and how well its working
3042164 we were not completely surprised to find the high rate of adherence to art in children in low income countries because it mirrors the results of adult studies but there is no question that it is reassuring to learn that even in settings where families face many challenges children are still able to adhere to a demanding yet essential medication regimen
3042165 our efforts to increase access to art must be coupled with research to inform strategies to deliver that therapy
3042166 we told dreamworks ceo stacey snider that based on what weve seen were very concerned it seems like the r word is used throughout the film and thats viewed as hate speech
3042167 adding an educational trailer to film to educate people about intellectual disability and how hateful the language in their film is or leading a national campaign to eliminate the r word from the national lexicon or a similar initiative within the entertainment industry

3042176 at one time we could put on peaceful demonstrations without hinderance even after september 11th now we feel very closely watched but we are obviously not terrorists we were stopped four times while filming about hinkley c last year and two weeks ago were called to give details of our plans to demonstrate against the sale of british energy to french owned edf
3042177 guarding against terrorism is one thing but there seems to be another agenda with the big ongoing protest at kingsbridge coal power station in kent i can see the government wants to put people off these gatherings even though they are lawful and peaceful but expanding the powers of these guards is not the way to resolve peoples concerns about climate change or nuclear power a sustainable energy policy would be better

3042184 watch out that no one deceives you many will come in my name claiming i am he and will deceive many v 6 at that time if anyone says to you look here is the christ messiah or look there he is do not believe it for false christs messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect if that were possible so be on your guard i have told you everything ahead of time v 21 23 at that time men will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory
3042185 so if anyone tells you there he is out in the desert do not go out or here he is in the inner rooms do not believe it for as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west so will be the coming of the son of man

3042249 students cant learn and teachers cant teach in classrooms where kids are disruptive some teachers are afraid to restore order when needed because they fear legal harassment its unacceptable that a teacher would have that hesitation

3042294 i certainly dont think income level reflects whether people are nice or not
3042295 it will fit into the development really nicely there is definitely a need for this housing
3042296 we all kind of look at san angelo as a second home
3042297 any of these tax credit projects that increase our affordable housing are good for san angelo
3042298 its rubble how do you convert that into condos and rentals it takes a lot of work
3042299 i feel it is one of those fringe cities of manhattan that has potential for growth starting with access to manhattan
3042300 i see this as a catalyst nothing happens until this building gets up and running
3042301 the optimal use for the building from the citys perspective is office space
3042302 we have entertained proposals including mixed use retail residential medical offices senior housing governmental school board offices and a number of other ideas as well none of the ideas have unfortunately progressed beyond an initial expression of interest
3042303 if its too costly we many not want to go forward with it
3042304 i think the message was without some kind of public money in the project it doesnt make sense financially he said
3042305 to have the project done privately the numbers dont work
3042306 we aim to help them out get whatever they need
3042307 if they need training on computers we will give them training on computers if they need training to find a job we will help them find a job we will be addressing the rest of the needs of the community
3042308 its not like youre building a home or commercial property where you need one or two variances
3042309 you are building a whole complex starting on a clean slate would be easier with zoning rather than having to deal with all these issues as you move along with each component of the project
3042310 it is going to take some time to build it and get all the elements together
3042311 we dont want to drive businesses out of paterson but i must add that if his business is not adversely affected by this we have to go full speed ahead
3042312 housing stock is a core element of any communitys infrastructure
3042313 it provides a safe nurturing environment to pursue the american dream in a community as young as ours we havent had a huge issue in terms of aging and deteriorating quality but we have to stay ahead of it
3042314 this will help determine what type of reinvestment is most needed on an area by area basis
3042315 when a code enforcement officer is out in the community and encounters a challenge thats bigger than a couch on the sidewalk they can call us in
3042316 it almost verges on being criminal the way we have underutilized the expertise of faculty and students
3042317 the 20 something market is looking for amenities and a sense of place the older properties tend to not represent that they may have a swimming pool but the new ones have wireless internet access pool tables fitness centers concierge service we need to start talking to property owners about what they can do to make themselves comparable to the newer properties
3042318 were always willing to work with the city and make the properties more marketable
3042319 if theres grants out there available for these properties then that would be great
3042320 i think its a good plan from what i know about it
3042321 its going to be a wait and see kind of thing well closely watch it and attend any meetings on the topic we just dont know yet how many properties its going to help
3042322 i believe some of our biggest challenges are with multi family housing
3042323 im proposing to really get serious about this identify the needs and start looking at them in terms of taking them to the next level a lot of these properties still have a lot of life
3042324 were in a unique position to do an in depth market analysis to demonstrate that reinvestment in their property will allow them to go to a higher rental rate were also in a position to help them market their property
3042325 lets be honest the challenge we have in the economy is the people you need to help support the overall economy cant have a piece of the dream
3042326 theres some communities on the west coast that are major tourism economies and theyre unable to house the people who fuel that segment of the economy
3042327 youve got to have all the price ranges to have a healthy workforce
3042328 if we had some nice condos that students could own it would be an alternative to living in neighborhoods
3042329 rather than do a focus group i envision it as an ongoing thing where we engage the community
3042330 im a realist and ive been in the community since 1970
3042331 i appreciate the challenges that are facing it what im hearing is a change in philosophical position instead of putting out spot fires lets take that 2 million and instead of trying to fix a little house here and a little house there try to find a large project and go after it
3042332 im not so concerned about the money because you keep talking about equity partners the only way youre going to be able to accomplish this is if the community steps forward im on board

3042360 het zijn meestal leraren of studenten theologie maar ook toeristen die op zoek zijn naar informatie over piet paaltjens zoals ds fran ois haverschmidt zich noemde zo komen hier om vanaf de kansel gedichten te declameren om elkaar verhalen te vertellen en om zomaar in rust de verstilde sfeer van foudgum te proeven
3042361 het was hier echt zo stil de dagen waren lang de tijd die het huishouden vroeg was kort de dynamiek van het dorp zat vooral in het verplaatsen van de koeien voor het melken het was goed maar saai toen ik in de kerk een boekje vond over fran ois haverschmidt klikte het meteen tussen ons ik begreep die man die zich hier zo eenzaam voelde verstoken van alle cultuur hij moet een lieve dominee zijn geweest die goed kom opschieten met kinderen en vele uren aan de ziek en sterfbedden heeft gezeten

3042365 ik verblijf in een paradijs van kleur en bemin de zon
3042366 uw woord is een lamp voor mijn voet en een licht op mijn pad
3042367 ik denk dat het schrijven van literatuur extra moeilijk is voor mensen die hun geloof even serieus nemen als hun vak
3042368 hoe combineer je de individualiteit authenticiteit en eerlijkheid die van een schrijver gevraagd worden met het leven binnen een christelijke gemeenschap waar collectieve regels en gebruiken gelden die twee dingen zijn in wezen strijdig met elkaar
3042369 mijn romans worden door veel christelijke lezers als niet christelijk genoeg beschouwd er wordt niet genoeg gebeden en gezongen en de hoofdpersonen putten hoop en bemoediging uit gebeurtenissen of verhalen die n t rechtstreeks uit de bijbel afkomstig zijn de moraal is te impliciet maar eigenlijk hebben we het dan niet over het verschil tussen christelijke en niet christelijke verhalen maar over het verschil tussen literaire en niet literaire verhalen
3042370 elk jaar opnieuw zie ik mijn christelijke studenten daarmee worstelen hun zondagsschoolonderwijzer heeft ze vroeger uitdrukkelijk verboden om zich te verdiepen in het kwaad om slechte gedachten te denken en dan kom ik ze vertellen dat ze dat w l moeten doen omdat het voor een schrijver noodzakelijk is zich met hart en ziel in te leven in de ander en daarbij de duisternis in zichzelf te ontdekken dat is wat romanschrijvers doen hun gevoelens onderzoeken hun herinneringen tegen het licht houden eerlijk zijn je kunt bang zijn voor die dingen in jezelf maar je zult ze aan de oppervlakte moeten brengen de zondaar in jezelf ontdekken
3042371 ik zeg tegen mijn studenten als jullie willen schrijven moet je weten wat in de wereld geldt als een goed verhaal zulke verhalen krijgen ze dus te lezen verhalen waardoor mijn moeder geschokt zou zijn dat besef ik maar we mogen ons niet opsluiten in een bastion we maken deel uit van deze wereld we kunnen dus maar beter kennisnemen van dat seculiere gedachtegoed om onze eigen christelijke erfenis ernaast te leggen en waar kun je dat beter en veiliger leren dan binnen een christelijk instituut
3042372 om dat verhaal te kunnen schrijven heb ik allerlei geschiedenisboeken doorgenomen steeds weer lees je dan over die enorme vloot van wel duizend marineschepen veerboten vissersschepen en allerlei kleinere plezierbootjes die in juni 1940 heen en weer voer over het kanaal om zo veel mogelijk soldaten te evacueren maar wat bijna niemand weet wat in de meeste boeken niet te lezen valt tijdens die evacuatie hebben churchill en de aartsbisschop van canterbury een biddag voor de troepen afgekondigd ze vroegen mensen om halverwege de dag met hun werk te stoppen om te gaan bidden in de kerk of waar dan ook en wat blijkt op de dag nadat overal in engeland mensen in gebed waren voor de soldaten betrok de lucht boven het kanaal zodat de luftwaffe niet kon bombarderen ik denk dat die biddag daar iets mee te maken heeft
3042373 de moeder van mijn hoofdpersoon gaat naar de kerk tijdens die biddag maar de vader wil eerst niet pas in de loop van het verhaal zie je hem geleidelijk aan veranderen als resultaat van alle gebeurtenissen en ontwikkelingen dat is voor mij een manier om gods macht in deze situatie te laten zien
3042374 ik wil niet preken tegen mijn publiek zoals dat in het verleden vaak gebeurde daarin ben ik trouwens niet de enige veel schrijvers van christelijke jeugdboeken proberen tegenwoordig subtieler en implicieter iets van hun geloof merkbaar te laten worden in hun boeken niet dik erbovenop gelegd maar verweven in de verhaallijnen het gaat erom dat een schrijver zijn lezers aan het denken zet doordat de hoofdpersoon een ontwikkeling doormaakt waarin iets van vergeving hoop verlossing zichtbaar wordt
3042375 vertel mij niet dat god niet de hand heeft in zulke dingen ik merk het zelfs in de kleine gebeurtenissen in mijn eigen leven in mijn werken aan dit boek de toevallige ontmoetingen met bijzondere mensen die precies d t verhaal vertelden dat ik nodig had de manier waarop de geschiedenis van mijn eigen moeder me verder hielp met de plot de reactie van mijn zoon allerlei dingen uit mijn eigen leven komen samen in dit boek en dat heb ik als een heel wonderbaarlijk proces ervaren
3042376 onze colleges voor literatuurstudenten gaan niet alleen over boeken van beroemde auteurs ze zijn er k op gericht studenten te helpen bij hun roeping tot het schrijverschap als docenten engels hebben we allemaal ervaring met boeken schrijven en publiceren zodat we onze studenten iets kunnen leren over het schrijfproces en hen kunnen helpen bij de stappen die ze moeten zetten om te worden uitgegeven het gaat erom dat we ze stimuleren dat ze gaan geloven dat zij het k kunnen
3042377 ik denk dat je als schrijver niet moet beginnen met de boodschap als je dat doet help je je verhaal maar al te vaak om zeep de karakters worden houterig de gebeurtenissen onrealistisch je weet van tevoren precies waar het heen moet en dus kan het verhaal jou als schrijver niet meer verrassen
3042378 laat ik een voorbeeld geven mijn eigen roman begon met het plaatje van een man van middelbare leeftijd die uit het raam naar beneden keek naar zijn vader dat was wat ik voor me zag en van daaruit ben ik begonnen met schrijven wie zijn die mannen hoe is hun verhouding de ingang naar een goed verhaal ligt niet in de wereld van de idee n maar in de wereld van de zintuigen het begint altijd met een anekdote een beeld een geluid
3042379 al schrijvend leer ik ze kennen probeer ik te ontdekken waar ze heen willen dat is het belangrijkste daarna kan ik me altijd nog zorgen gaan maken over de vraag wat het verhaal te zeggen heeft meestal kom ik daar in de loop van het schrijfproces pas achter ik probeer trouw te zijn aan mijn levensbeschouwing maar ik wil me geen zorgen maken of mijn boeken wel voldoende christelijk zijn als het goed is weerspiegelt een verhaal vanzelf wat een schrijver gelooft
3042380 het schrijverschap is een roeping ja zo beschouw ik dat wel ik ben opgevoed in een echt gereformeerd huisgezin waar veel gelezen werd elke dag de kinderbijbel vooral de verhalen uit het oude testament spraken me enorm aan maar ook veel andere lectuur ik ben altijd een gretige lezer geweest en als ik iets zie wat ik hevig bewonder wil ik hetzelfde gaan doen voor mij betekende het lezen van de boeken van flannery oconnor een doorbraak zij liet me zien dat je een christelijke schrijver kon zijn en literatuur schrijven en dat je het daarbij gewoon over je eigen gemeenschap kon hebben in mijn geval dus de wereld van de gereformeerde nederlandse immigranten in canada
3042381 ik dacht als het echt goed geschreven is dan zal het wel een publiek vinden
3042382 we are absolutely committed to taking all the necessary measures to protect the mountain gorillas and bring security to the people living around virunga national park
3042383 the new team that we have appointed is a major step toward achieving this goal
3042384 a move by the congolese authorities to strengthen the rule of law step up anti poaching and prevent forest destruction for charcoal in africas oldest national park
3042385 i previously could not have imagined doing this type of work
3042386 but i have a type of empathy toward them i can imagine sitting in a cage and waiting my turn for a medical procedure i can imagine what it would be like not to have a name they suffer like we suffer
3042387 when they want something a juice box on the table or an apple and you dont understand theyll reach out to the lock twisting it as if to open it
3042388 i was extremely interested to read about the new specimens from andrahomana cave
3042389 when i saw the photos of the new pieces of frontal bone i was positive they would fit into the skull
3042390 it was obvious that the fossils all belonged to the same individual because the newly discovered fragments fit into the skull so cleanly we decided to attempt a more thorough virtual reconstruction filling in other missing pieces using the ct data or making mirror images of undamaged sections to restore damaged ones
3042391 we did all the work with the help of computers and neither all of the scientists nor all of the specimens were ever in the same room
3042392 i have as much authority as the pope i just dont have as many people who believe it
3042393 im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death
3042394 think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that
3042395 the only good thing ever to come out of religion was the music
3042396 i dont have pet peeves i have major psychotic fucking hatreds
3042397 average roundtrip cost of jet fuel todays prices is about 300 per passenger we would have to charge about 650 700 a passenger to break even
3042398 fares probably need to increase at this point another 15 20 percent before airlines cover their costs
3042399 at some point it becomes like a saturday night live skit where youre paying for a seat belt and to use the bathroom theyre running out of things to charge us for
3042400 final 8 state websites the websites that were in contention as of june
3042401 nearly 1 55 billion passengers arrived and departed from north american airports in 2007 a 3 5 percent increase from the previous year
3042402 traveling is a luxury you will have to pay more for it live and fly with it
3042403 airlines must change the rules in order to survive high oil prices and the other challenges the industry faces
3042404 as passengers we need to realize that the cost of our airline ticket does not cover these extra services
3042405 will airline ticket prices go down with the price of oil
3042406 dots auction proposal is unlawful unwise and will do absolutely nothing to reduce congestion and flight delays in new york dot has left us no options we will sue to prevent this illegal action
3042407 if ritz carlton hotels put a commercial jetliner into service it would be like the airbus
3042408 option to re schedule or re route your travel once without penalty
3042409 im not in the mood for this game today what else can i play
3042410 rove personally directed the firings then used his assistant to cover up his involvement
3042411 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3042412 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife
3042413 id say im about 80 percent its gotten better from when i first hurt it but im still not where i need to be its really starting to get on my nerves
3042414 hes down hes disappointed there is a period of time where he will not be able to help us all he can do now is try to get himself back
3042415 i feel like im going to be better i feel im on tweaked his ankle during practice so rookie joey larocque got more reps i have a lot of confidence in marty marty looks like hes in really great shape and hes doing all the things that we saw when he was in chicago the first time
3042416 americas toughest jobs is for everyone whos ever wished for a chance to leave behind the safe comfortable monotony of their job for something more
3042417 there are without doubt more women here than men and that is a fascinating phenomenon because other sciences are still dominated by men but it seems primatology is becoming a womans field
3042418 but that doesnt make this soft science its tough out there working with these animals there are theories about nurturing and women treating the primates like children but they would get short shrift at this conference we find such notions patronising and demeaning to what we do
3042419 i would put it down to the influences of the likes of fossey goodall and galdikas rather than fluffy bunny rabbit syndrome these three women represent the top of this game plain and simple
3042420 women have an advantage in trying to understand animal behaviour because we must have an inbuilt ability to understand their wants and needs through non verbal communication in other words to understand our own babies before they can speak
3042421 scientists are humans before they are scientists and we are all affected by our gender male primatologists have been concerned with the study of males and women with the female of the species
3042422 women are more likely to understand the primates and are more likely to stick it out for research which can last decades as some of these animals can live up to 50 years in the wild

3042424 an asteroid with a diameter of one kilometer would have a mass of about two billion tons there are perhaps one million asteroids of this size in the solar system one of these asteroids would contain 30 million tons of nickel 1 5 million tons of metal cobalt and 7 500 tons of platinum

3042432 diego has coped really well with losing his mother at such a young age and he is displaying all the normal behaviours we would expect of a baby howler monkey
3042433 at the moment we place him within sight of the other howler monkeys during the day for the next stage of reintroduction we are creating a purpose built cage for him so he can be safely placed into the enclosure by the end of the year he will be fully integrated into the group
3042434 as a section we are very experienced in hand rearing primates
3042435 it is a big commitment but its an extremely rewarding experience
3042436 the remarkable dedication of our conservation partners in virunga despite many dangers deserves wide recognition we believe that conservation can play an integral role in establishing stability and supporting economic development in the region
3042437 conservation of the gorillas in virunga mountains cannot be done by only one state because they gorillas dont need passports to cross to the trans boundary virunga region that is why we should combine forces and cooperation in protection and preservation of these unique species
3042438 as we discuss conservation in the region we must be mindful of the people we serve like those who live along the protected areas because they are part of the landscape and therefore part of conservation these are the people whose land and crops are destroyed by the animals we must therefore prove our relevancy to the people we serve through enhanced conservation benefits by proper manifestation of shared policy of poverty reduction
3042439 the mountain gorillas found in the trans boundary virunga region are unique and the very few remaining species worldwide virunga mountains contain 325 out of the 720 remaining mountain gorillas in the world
3042440 last year seven mountain gorillas were murdered in the drc territory this was a great loss that attracted the attention of the world media we should therefore find a permanent security solution to avoid further losses
3042441 the book says they should be playing independently for 20 minutes can yours really do that

3042444 i am a catholic priest of good standing in my diocese and unlike fr lawler have always
3042445 your total lack of respect for bishop roche is a disgrace do you not realise that he is a successor of the apostles perhaps you dont like him because he does not wear a precious enough mitre or fiddleback chasubles if fr lawler was a true
3042446 in seminary he was divisive the word used by the vicar general to describe fr lawlers ministry
3042447 i believe that he attended a traditional conference organised by the latin mass society in oxford a few days ago such gatherings only go to promote trouble in the church
3042448 i hope and pray that bishop roche will not back down and take the bull by the horns suspend fr lawler and close the church at allerton bywater as originally planned
3042449 the footage and photos from yesterday will demonstrate loudly to officials at the holy see and indded the holy father himself that this community has a flawed understanding of loyalty and little or no understanding of communion in the church this i suspect will come as news to them they just want their church kept open i do hope that more moderate voices will rise up to tell the headstrong activisits that you do not wnat these things being done in your name yesterday a further wound was inflcited on christs church

3042464 we believe our proposal is clearly superior for republics stockholders and is designed so we can work cooperatively with republic
3042465 waste managements bid is inline with the 36 38 range where we think the company could execute an all cash bid for republic without issuing additional equity and maintain its investment grade debt rating
3042466 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them

3042503 it appears the banks debt will not be paid from the sale of the assets
3042504 the banks will suffer a substantial deficiency and therefore theres no chance of creditors getting a dividend hence shareholders will not have any likelihood of a return
3042505 the credit crisis is providing an excellent reality check for financial organisations that have set up management information systems decision support systems data warehouses data marts and business intelligence systems that were at some point hailed as the key to reliable data aggregation and information mining
3042506 globally billions of it dollars have been spent on such systems in the banking sector yet these systems cannot calculate even the most basic figures needed to make sound business decisions in a timely manner
3042507 due to the lack of reliable and timely information traders and investors are forced to make decisions based on performance figures that are only visible through a smokescreen
3042508 product design details tend to be encrypted in software source code data quality is often not quantifiable and the low quality incomplete system integration introduces numerous manual steps that slow down the computation of performance figures

3042516 er zijn steeds meer landen met wie wij een samenwerking aangaan dus we moeten systemen steeds opnieuw op elkaar aanpassen
3042517 ik heb op dit moment het sepa project onder mijn hoede dus ik ben dagelijks bezig met het testen van bestanden van andere europese transactieverwerkers
3042518 maar nu moet ik nog gaan kijken of het inhoudelijk allemaal aan onze eisen voldoet
3042519 ik ga dan meteen uitzoeken bij wie die fout ligt heeft iemand bij ons de naam verkeerd ingevoerd waardoor het systeem het niet herkent of is het een fout bij de grieken
3042520 de testers moeten niet lastig worden gevallen met telefoontjes dat kan afleiden
3042521 ik ben blij dat ik leiding mag geven aan een team met zon grote betrokkenheid het licht gaat hier niet om vijf uur s middags uit je wilt zeker weten dat de systemen goed lopen dus daar doen we moeite voor
3042522 het is toch gewoon mooi om te zien dat iets werkt jij hebt er aan meegewerkt en daar zie je dagelijks het resultaat van
3042523 alles wordt uitgebreid getest omdat er niks fout mag gaan wij doen onze uiterste best om het betalingsverkeer soepel te laten verlopen als wij stilstaan blijft de economie ook stilstaan bedenk maar wat er gebeurt als mensen hun geld niet op tijd krijgen of als het pinsysteem er tien minuten of erger een dag uitligt

3042542 quella volta in cui un cliente urt il cardinale ratzinger
3042543 sono arrivato in questo luogo bello e silenzioso ha detto per riposarmi un po ringrazio il vescovo egger e i suoi collaboratori la regione e la citt di bressanone per avermi preparato questo luogo in cui ho potuto pensare a dio agli uomini e recuperare nuove energie molte sono le persone che dovrei ringraziare le affido tutte alla benedizione di dio che conosce ciascuno per nome
3042544 il vangelo di questa domenica ha sottolineato benedetto xvi ci porta da questo momento di pace alla quotidianit racconta come il signore dopo la moltiplicazione dei pani si ritiri sul monte per stare da solo con il padre nel frattempo i discepoli si trovano sulla loro povera barca e si affaticano inutilmente contro il vento contrario probabilmente per levangelista un ritratto della chiesa dei suoi tempi in cui la piccola barca della chiesa di allora si doveva confrontare con il vento contrario della storia e sembrava che si fosse perso il signore
3042545 il vangelo ci offre una risposta ci d consolazione e incoraggiamento ha proseguito e ci mostra una via ges con il padre ma per questo non lontano vede tutti perch chi con dio non lontano ma vicino a ciascuno
3042546 anche a noi oggi il signore continua a tendere la mano ha detto il papa lo fa attraverso questa bella domenica attraverso la liturgia festiva nella preghiera in numerosissime situazioni della nostra quotidianit
3042547 tendiamo nel nome del signore la nostra mano a chi nel bisogno ha sottolineato per accompagnarli sopra le acque agitate della nostra storia
3042548 i volti gioiosi di tanti ragazzi e ragazze di ogni parte del mondo
3042549 un segno di gioia autentica a tratti chiassosa ma sempre pacifica e positiva
3042550 malgrado fossero tanti ha ricordato il papa non hanno causato disordini n recato alcun danno per essere allegri non hanno avuto bisogno di ricorrere a modi sguaiati e violenti allalcool e a sostanze stupefacenti cera in essi la gioia di incontrarsi e di scoprire insieme un mondo nuovo
3042551 come non fare un confronto con i loro coetanei si interrogato benedetto xvi che in cerca di false evasioni consumano esperienze degradanti che sfociano non di rado in sconvolgenti tragedie
3042552 colmare un vuoto interiore e la noia che lo accompagna induce a tentare esperienze nuove pi emozionanti pi estreme
3042553 rischiano di dissiparsi in un vano inseguire miraggi di piacere
3042554 ma in questo modo ha aggiunto il papa lo spirito non riposa il cuore non prova gioia e non trova pace anzi finisce per essere ancora pi stanco e triste di prima
3042555 la riflessione vale per tutti ha concluso la persona umana si rigenera veramente solo nel rapporto con dio e dio lo si incontra imparando ad ascoltare la sua voce nella quiete interiore e nel silenzio
3042556 in una societ dove si va sempre pi di corsa le vacanze siano giorni di vera distensione durante i quali si sappiano ritagliare momenti per il raccoglimento e per la preghiera indispensabili per ritrovare profondamente se stessi e gli altri
3042557 nel congedarsi dalla folla benedetto xvi ha rivolto anche in questa seconda domenica un saluto in ladino ai fedeli delle valli badia e gardena
3042558 cari fedeli delle valli ladine ha detto il papa s giuseppe freinademetz ha portato il vangelo ai popoli lontani cos anche voi dovete essere testimoni e ambasciatori della fede nelle vostre famiglie nei vostri paesi nella societ date ai turisti che vengono nelle vostre vallate la testimonianza della fede
3042559 vi ringrazio cari amici per il vostro lavoro e vi assicuro le mie preghiere per le vostre intenzioni familiari e professionali
3042560 trascorsa serenamente anche la seconda settimana del mio soggiorno qui a bressanone si legge nel testo ed ormai prossimo il momento di lasciare questa bella terra dove mi sono sentito come a casa sia per la familiarit dei luoghi che per lospitalit della gente
3042561 sosta ristoratrice per il fisico e per lo spirito si legge ancora la mia riconoscenza va anche a tutti coloro che si sono fatti strumenti operosi della sua provvidenza ho potuto riposare nel modo che meglio si addice ad un ministro di dio dedicandomi alla preghiera alla lettura e alla meditazione senza lassillo delle quotidiane urgenze pastorali
3042562 queste si legge nel testo non le ho certo dimenticate ma per cos dire le ho come filtrate attraverso un salutare distacco che aiuta a ristabilire le giuste proporzioni a riconoscere che il signore dio e noi siamo soltanto suoi umili collaboratori per il servizio della chiesa e per il bene dellumanit
3042563 grande beneficio conclude il testo ho ricavato anche dal contesto ambientale in cui ho ammirato il rispetto della natura e la cura per il creato che avevo riscontrato in australia in occasione della giornata mondiale della giovent

3042567 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
3042568 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
3042569 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
3042570 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
3042571 you told me more about the process than i know
3042572 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
3042573 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
3042574 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
3042575 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
3042576 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
3042577 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands

3042580 granted passports to most of south ossetias residents and the regions separatist leaders sought to absorb it into russia
3042581 georgia whose troops have been trained by american soldiers began an offensive to regain control over south ossetia last friday night launching heavy rocket and artillery fire and air strikes that pounded the provincial capital tskhinvali georgia says it was responding to attacks by separatists in response russia launched massive artillery shelling and air attacks on georgian troops
3042582 said more than 2000 people had been killed in south ossetia since last friday most of them ossetians with russian passports thousands of civilians have fled the war ravaged province many seeking shelter in the russian province of north ossetia
3042583 the georgians burned all of our homes the georgians say it is their land where is our land then we dont know
3042584 russia bombed several targets inside georgia including some close to the capital tbilisi
3042585 said military operations in south ossetia were nearing their conclusion however despite sharp criticism from the u s and nato moscow was unrepentant about its armed punishment of georgia the georgian government in tbilisi said up to 50 russian bombers had attacked its territory overnight with one russian bomb reported to have landed near the capitals civilian airport shortly after the french foreign minister bernard kouchner had landed
3042586 today joined george w bush in criticizing russia over its disproportionate use of force against georgia the former soviet republic that nato leaders declared in april would one day be a member of the alliance
3042587 i was very firm with vladimir putin he and i have got a good relationship just like i was firm with the russian president
3042588 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3042589 raised tensions between russia and its former c old w ar foes to their highest level in decades bush has promoted georgia as a bastion of democracy helped strengthen its military and urged that nato admit the country to membership georgia serves as a major conduit for oil flowing from russia and central asia to the west but russia emboldened by windfall profits from oil exports is showing a resolve to reassert its dominance in a region it has always considered its near abroad russias military action which has involved air naval and missile attacks is the largest engagement by russian forces outside its borders since the collapse of the soviet union
3042590 the limits of western influence over russia at a time when the rest of europe depends heavily on russia for natural gas and the united states needs moscows cooperation if it hopes to curtail what it believes is a nuclear weapons threat from iran
3042591 the international community collectively held their sic breath waiting for the reaction of russia after the savage brutal criminal attack by georgia on south ossetia after having offered a cease fire in hostilities the back stabbing georgians immediately violated the cease fire invading south ossetia and causing massive destruction and death among innocent civilians meanwhile the w estern corporate media was sic maintaining a blackout of the grand silence on the aggression of georgia
3042592 the russian military presence in south ossetia complies with international law and is aimed at enforcing peace as it has done throughout history russia continues to guarantee peace and security in the caucasus the action by georgia contravenes russias mandate for peacekeeping and amounts to blatant aggression russian peacekeeping forces and unarmed women children and elderly have been the victims russia will continue to take adequate military and political measures for the immediate cessation of violence and to protect civilians including women children and the elderly most of whom are citizens of the russian federation as it implements a peacekeeping mission
3042593 russia could pull out from south ossetia if an agreement to restore the status quo is reached on the other hand it can increase its military presence in the breakaway republic to deter georgia from attacking it again in which case this could be called annexation the war could have been prevented russia could have forced a settlement by pushing south ossetian leader eduard kokoity to negotiate a broad autonomy within georgia but as prime minister vladimir putin suggested on saturday at a news conference in north ossetia that option is now closed it is hard to imagine how south ossetia can ever be persuaded to reintegrate with georgia after this putin said
3042594 im afraid russia might end up owning the place without the legal title to it
3042595 that israeli arms sales to georgia could harm israels relations with russia
3042596 russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in what is thought to have been an indirect reference to israel lashed out against georgias western allies those who have been supplying arms to georgia they should feel part of the blame for the loss of life the

3042644 the reserve bank is tip toeing rather than striding down the path of rate cuts
3042645 but the timing and size of any rate move is dependent on economic data to be released over the next few weeks a decision on a september rate cut could actually be left until the eleventh hour given that figures on retail spending and building approvals are both released on the day of the next board meeting

3042657 while current conditions have challenged our wholesale businesses we have been able to leverage the strength of our retail franchise to
3042658 there was no specific guidance going forward and that is a point for caution
3042659 the composition of the result was ok and there were no negative surprises that derailed the bottom line
3042660 the bendigo bank retail network continues to expand by around 25 branches each year and with a high proportion of branches yet to reach maturity future income growth is to some extent locked in
3042661 we are also taking the opportunity afforded by the current disruption to wholesale markets to reshape those businesses for growth and improved margins once funding begins to flow again
3042662 the strong result for the year was driven by good sales and margin growth in pipelines and tradelink
3042663 the major disappointment in the result was our cdnz business which is the result of pretty poor conditions in new zealand and our inability to bring our costs down in line with those quick enough
3042664 thats a substantial cut considering the market was expecting earnings per share growth in the order of 25 per cent in the coming year
3042665 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult

3042671 of course there is no measuring the intrinsic value of the market to melbourne life and culture
3042672 the 90s were tough but now that people are returning to a more simple lifestyle and inner city living has become so popular the market is really thriving

3042696 bernie quinlan won a brownlow medal as a midfielder and then he played until he was 36 as a full forward adam is about the same size as bernie
3042697 theres obviously a precedent and bernie was an outstanding midfielder and he went on to become an outstanding full forward
3042698 hes goodes obviously not 100 per cent but watching him on saturday night i dont know how much he is
3042699 hes certainly looking a lot better than what chris judd was last year and barry hall but he played forward against fremantle and he didnt have to run the whole game
3042700 you want to be playing well going into the finals regardless of whether you finish eighth or fourth
3042701 theres no point limping into the finals with poor form or a lot of injuries
3042702 the concern at the moment is we play some good footy on the weekend and weve got to play some more good footy against geelong
3042703 its possible to play well and not win against geelong because they are such a good team we are certainly going out there with a bit more confidence than we did last week
3042704 if juan hernandez the wonderful five eights arguably as good a player as daniel carter had been playing the pumas would have certainly scored a couple of tries during their period of
3042705 if you look at the quality of the squad weve got and when you sign the players that we signed in the off season you would expect to be short priced favourites
3042706 weve got to live with that but it will be interesting to see how we cope with the pressure
3042707 sydney wont have any worries about overseas players coming in and needing six months to settle in theyre local boys and they know whats required of them
3042708 pre season is pre season but in saying that weve started really well its given us a bit of confidence so certainly the signs are looking good
3042709 were quite happy to fly under the radar but ultimately no new zealand team has finished better than last and were out to change that and get in the top four
3042710 i think this is going to be the closest a league weve had so far
3042711 all eight teams would be crazy not to be aiming for the top four
3042712 if you get up there and hold the trophy at the end of the year than you know youll be a worthy winner
3042713 if juan hernandez the wonderful five eights arguably as good a player as daniel carter had been playing the pumas would have certainly scored a couple of tries during their period of
3042714 no rugby leagues given me so many great things and this club has as well so there might be an opportunity out there to make a bit more money but i think i owe the club and game plenty
3042715 so im not going to leave the game to chase some bigger cheque
3042716 for that sort of money id dance for them if they wanted me to
3042717 i wouldnt give my future too much thought until probably midway through next year when we have to decide what my next contract will be
3042718 im not thinking about 300 games or breaking any records if i happen to pass those sort of records then thats great and ill look back one day when i do hang the boots up and be happy with that achievement
3042719 but at this stage itll be this year and next year with the broncos and beyond that we dont know yet

3042722 three years ago i was standing before you and announcing the formation of the a league i remember i was very nervous very excited and didnt know what the future held for us
3042723 one of the things i did was i said if i needed to i would get down on my knees and beg for people to come but as it happened i didnt need to get down on my knees and they did come
3042724 we are pleased at how successful the a league is
3042725 the crowds are growing the television audience is growing membership is growing the media coverage as well and the game is reasonably financially sound
3042726 the most important piece of the puzzle in the reformation
3042727 if i put on my optimistic view which i have to do in this job maybe we will end up with 14 teams
3042728 of course that would be wonderful if we could do that and it would be wonderful if the teams are also strong at the time
3042729 i am expecting next season well have 10 teams and i hope not so long after that we might have 12 teams
3042730 there is a lot more to do in the a league and we have some important and ambitious long term goals for the a league
3042731 if juan hernandez the wonderful five eights arguably as good a player as daniel carter had been playing the pumas would have certainly scored a couple of tries during their period of
3042732 if he keeps doing what hes doing at the moment and improving at the rate he is a rep jumpers definitely not out of the question
3042733 hes always been confident in his ability but hes just come along so much with the more first grade games hes played
3042734 hes consistently been in there now the last couple of years and i think hes getting smarter with the way he plays his footy
3042735 theres no doubt were going to miss toddys football brain and what he added to the side but weve had to move on as a group and i think terrys shown that hes ready to step into that leadership role especially in the halves
3042736 it seems the more pressure hes been under the better hes got hes still only a young guy its pretty exciting
3042737 were pretty aware of our situation we have a couple of losses in the next few weeks and all our hard work comes undone
3042738 if juan hernandez the wonderful five eights arguably as good a player as daniel carter had been playing the pumas would have certainly scored a couple of tries during their period of
3042739 you dont play arsenal each day it is a tricky draw we already said that but in football anything can happen we must prepare ourselves well and work like crazy for each other on the field
3042740 i am confident and have belief the team will be focused and treat twente with respect
3042741 we have learned through our experience and i am confident we can qualify you always expect good opposition in holland but i believe we are good enough to get through
3042742 what is at stake here is the work of a whole year
3042743 if juan hernandez the wonderful five eights arguably as good a player as daniel carter had been playing the pumas would have certainly scored a couple of tries during their period of
3042744 there were a few big boys out there tonight and thats something ill work on
3042745 i got roughed up before but that was something youd expect
3042746 im back to school tomorrow ive got to start studying for my end of term tests
3042747 in all honesty hes not really ready for first grade and i wanted to see how he did handle it
3042748 he didnt play like a natural halfback and he was probably a little bit overawed when he got out there but individually he came out with some brilliant things
3042749 i would have liked to see him catch that ball and get a try it would have been a bit of a thrill
3042750 its nice we havent done it in the last couple of years so thats an achievement in itself
3042751 but we probably played three teams who were down on their luck
3042752 if juan hernandez the wonderful five eights arguably as good a player as daniel carter had been playing the pumas would have certainly scored a couple of tries during their period of
3042753 you cant play table tennis in there without a 20 bet being put down so worrying about where we are going to finish and how many games we finish doesnt even come into the thought process
3042754 the enjoyment you see on the boys faces there this morning after winning the game how can you tell them to lose its a ridiculous thought
3042755 being pulled out of full forward its probably been a saviour in some ways
3042756 im really enjoying my role up the ground its probably something i played a lot when i was younger so its not totally unfamiliar to me
3042757 you make your own destiny up the ground a bit you can go hunt the footy instead of relying on it getting kicked to you so its more enjoyable in that sense but its still enjoyable kicking goals as bernie mac ben mckinley would have found out yesterday with his seven goal haul
3042758 if juan hernandez the wonderful five eights arguably as good a player as daniel carter had been playing the pumas would have certainly scored a couple of tries during their period of
3042759 weve got the opportunity to get 12 next week against essendon and weve never beaten essendon in melbourne in the history of our club
3042760 hopefully its not one of those clubs where for some reason you just cant do it

3042762 the last two weeks he has gone to another level its yet to be seen longterm but certainly hes just purely from volume of possession thats not the be all and end all but he hasnt experienced that consistently and been able to do it the last two weeks
3042763 i think he will continue to grow as a midfielder hes in our senior leadership group hes a very important player for our football club and hopefully hell be here for 10 years

3042806 all wins are important but i suppose since the origin series weve been labouring a little bit at some stages in some games
3042807 we think theres some areas of our game we can improve and well have to improve but there were some good signs to be able to play 80 minutes at that intensity against manly even though we probably didnt execute it as well as wed like
3042808 just from that game the other night i think we can improve with our attack
3042809 the origin series takes a lot out of some guys physically and takes a lot out of some guys mentally so even during and after the origin series theres usually some signs there that weve had nine or 10 players who havent been at their best
3042810 we havent been at our best but theyve still found a way to win most of those games
3042811 a lot of its mental especially this time of the year but were sort of concentrating a little bit more on our physical stuff at the moment because we gave the origin players a whole heap of rest
3042812 were probably trying to build that up a little bit at the moment so thats one of our focuses
3042813 we think theyre fresh enough now for us to lift their training load and hopefully that will help us as well
3042814 theres probably a couple there that might be a little bit of a concern for this week they didnt train today

3042818 but first i just want to play good footy i want to win the competition with toulon and repay the faith that coach tana umaga has shown in me by getting out there and helping this team
3042819 its a new game and a new challenge and i know ive got a lot to learn but im excited to be learning off one of the all time greats in tana umaga
3042820 i think if i am as committed as i was to playing rugby league and learning the game then the next two years will work out
3042821 i think probably a forward going into the forwards would be a lot more difficult because theres a lot of things that are different
3042822 in the backs its still hard because of all the technical things its not as easy as people think

3042856 even after 29 months in other words more than two years we were still able to detect prions in the soil
3042857 the soil actually seems to increase the infectiousness of the pathogens the incubation period the time it takes for the disease to break out is exceedingly short even after the prions have persisted in the soil for 29 months all of the animals that were given contaminated soil became sick within a very short time these results indicate that fresh incidences of scrapie among sheep are due to contaminated pastures
3042858 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3042859 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3042860 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3042861 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3042862 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3042863 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box

3042923 most refugees want to go home most dont want to go somewhere new and restart their lives

3042949 in contrast to the accepted view the brain does use fat as fuel
3042950 our study shows that the minute by minute control of appetite is regulated by free radicals implying that if you interfere with free radicals you may affect eating and satiety
3042951 that each time a feeling of fullness or satiety is reached during a meal you may be chipping away some time from your maximum lifespan as the most free radicals are produced when satiety promoting brain cells are active
3042952 the timing of taking antioxidants may be critical for the control of appetite
3042953 if taken on an empty stomach antioxidants may further increase appetite however when taken with food they may affect satiety further studies are needed to determine whether any regiment of orally taken antioxidants could be used to control appetite in animals and humans

3043102 ive had my eye on ben curtis for a long time and i really believe he is going to add a lot to this team
3043103 i like the fact he won the british open and came back after having a down spell in his career and won those two tournaments in that one year i saw a lot of heart in ben curtis
3043104 ben has got that kind of demeanor we need on the ryder cup team
3043105 hes a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality
3043106 hes the type of guy thats going to just put his head down and barrel on
3043107 ive always had my eye on him i was hoping he played well at some point so i could either pick him or hed make the team and hes done it
3043108 ben curtis played terrific yesterday he didnt lose the pga padraig harrington went out and won it

3043118 flush with footage of misery left by the georgian assault in the separatist district of south ossetia but few if any reports mention russias bombing of georgia
3043119 that the russian fleet is located on the borders of georgia and that russian aviation is bombing georgian soil represent the facts
3043120 then it is already a russian georgian war that has exceeded the bounds of the problem of ossetian and abkhazian separatism
3043121 it was precisely this kind of restoration that mikheil saakashvili was preparing for since his first day he came to power because he desperately wants to resemble vladimir putin and if anyone can blame the georgian president for this it is his western friends but we in the post soviet space now the society here adores the victor with his bloody saber bared experienced diplomats who have devoted their lives to the negotiating process are out of favor here and if for mikheil saakashvili it became a point of honor and the point of life to retain power in georgia then he could not have come up with anything better than a new war on the russian model
3043122 russia lost the moral right for peacekeeping in abkhazia and south ossetia when circumventing the leadership of sovereign georgia it became close friends with the de facto organs of power of these self declared entities
3043123 now casting aside any decency bringing landing units into georgia bombing territory that isnt even part of the former south ossetian autonomous oblast russia has become a party to an armed conflict
3043124 even a short peace keeping war will not only provoke a growth in enmity toward russia on the part of western countries but also and this is more important for us will confirm russian society in the opinion that over there in the west there are not only arrogant rather stupid pindosy a derogatory term for americans but an enemy who will not yield
3043125 there are no real doubts about how western countries will view the russian attack this will allow president medvedev to be put in the unambiguous position of a strong national leader completely dependent on the power structures
3043126 what the russian siloviki have achieved over the last several months
3043127 at the same time it is completely unimportant who wins this war and who will be its victims the very fact of such a war means that control over russia will be retained by the siloviki the special services and putin the siloviki would even profit from the disgrace of russia in that case there will be a bigger outcry hysteria and money
3043128 the navy was ordered not to allow supplies of weapons and military hardware into georgia by sea

3043472 i was so relieved to see the ball hit the back of the net
3043473 we left ourselves no choice but to attack them we missed so many chances in our first game that we knew we just needed to relax and take our time and our chances against japan ours is a very good team and the chances will always come
3043474 we are beginning to hit our rhythm here in china
3043475 after the first game we made some changes and now we are moving forward the americans will be tough as they will be fighting for their lives
3043476 we want to win the game win the group and hopefully go on to win the tournament
3043477 i was actively involved in the game but once we went 1 3 down it became increasingly difficult for me and i was hardly involved afterwards
3043478 i need to work on my conditioning for games because having been out for so long it will take time before i come back into shape it is the aspect i need to improve in and then i am confident the goals will come
3043479 to be honest with you i am surprised about the reports
3043480 no one did anything like that to me we lost a game in poland which was painful for everyone but everything is fine and everyone is getting on with their lives
3043481 in principle we have come to an agreement and should make an announcement after sorting out a few areas
3043482 ive always said that i would serve no more than two full terms

3043496 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3043497 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3043498 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3043499 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3043500 one loss of a site because we missed a key date or it was typed incorrectly into something else could be pretty bad for our business
3043501 it was just hard yakka to physically look at all the sites every day and keep up with what was going on
3043502 we had 100 plus sites and a big spreadsheet that was completed with all the different headings in different colours
3043503 it used to be a two week task to add up our commitment for the remaining term of leases for audit purposes
3043504 now it takes us about five minutes just because weve streamlined some of the reports
3043505 it was a huge windfall at the end of the financial year to be able to do that
3043506 ten or 15 minutes as opposed to three weeks was a gigantic improvement
3043507 previously they would ring us wed have to sit down with them roll out the sheets of paper and pull out the files
3043508 weve been pulling a bit of demographic data from the leaseeagle system and the information on annual turnover for the centres sales figures etc
3043509 thats starting to build theres 12 months worth of data they can use to demonstrate store performance
3043510 that type of data doesnt accumulate overnight it takes a bit of time to build up but going into next year were going to have two years worth of trend information they can make some decisions on
3043511 they could have done for us for an additional fee but we had resources here and we wanted to familiarise ourselves with the system
3043512 the only thing we had to do then was scan and attach key documents into the system
3043513 synetek could have done it for us but it chose to take it on here and it has done that really well
3043514 for beijing our it security team expects 9 9 million filtered events per day three times the figure in torino
3043515 there are 13 non competition venues that we support and that includes the media centre athletes villages and bocog
3043516 the torch relay happens just for a day in one city but the work of setting up the operations centre has to be done at least a week in advance
3043517 bandwidth is at least 30mbps so uploading videos wont be a problem we have catered for them to send and receive large files without problems
3043518 policies that are smart and right and fair and good for america
3043519 a government as decent candid purposeful and compassionate as the american people themselves
3043520 what youre saying is theres no artificial pattern at all
3043521 we will ensure that our patent laws protect legitimate rights while not stifling innovation and creativity
3043522 it is kpmgs contention that in the next few years it professionals will be asked to work with the whole business to construct a sophisticated and robust set of measurement instrumentation and reporting tools for non financial data to track the flow of carbon through their business to the same level of detail that financial reporting tools do
3043523 a large number of it organisations are only giving sustainability cursory attention
3043524 at the moment there is way too much emphasis on getting our own house in order as it professionals with the emergence of these new tools will come the opportunity to seize leadership and engage with the whole business about how technology can be used to reduce the other 98 per cent of emissions that the it industry is not directly responsible for
3043525 its not enough to just green your data centre and apply virtualisation and think your job is done
3043526 it professionals have to step up to the plate and engage in a dialogue with the business to let them know technology has a role to improve the whole organisations environmental footprint
3043527 were very pleased with the technology and the opportunities with unwired well do it right not rushed
3043528 as we got larger we wanted to be able work smarter in how we delivered our pricing to the point of sale
3043529 one of the key drivers was that during our peak sales periods we have less experienced sales staff so we wanted to take decision making away from the staff and let the system take control
3043530 it was really at the point where it was not actually working had we not been able to improve it there would have been some hard decisions to be made
3043531 the credit crisis is providing an excellent reality check for financial organisations that have set up management information systems decision support systems data warehouses data marts and business intelligence systems that were at some point hailed as the key to reliable data aggregation and information mining
3043532 globally billions of it dollars have been spent on such systems in the banking sector yet these systems cannot calculate even the most basic figures needed to make sound business decisions in a timely manner
3043533 due to the lack of reliable and timely information traders and investors are forced to make decisions based on performance figures that are only visible through a smokescreen
3043534 product design details tend to be encrypted in software source code data quality is often not quantifiable and the low quality incomplete system integration introduces numerous manual steps that slow down the computation of performance figures
3043535 the iphone and the equivalents that emerge are going to take over the world
3043536 the capacity for people to do high level communications processes from anywhere with these little gadgets is going to have an extraordinary impact on our society and our economy

3043555 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3043556 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3043557 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3043558 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3043559 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3043560 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3043561 its one of those things where personally i like the long drawn out storylines
3043562 the buildups to big matches where triple h and i are the perfect example we had such a buildup for our match cena and i being in such a marquee match i really wish the buildup had been allowed i think a match like that deserves the fans emotional investment its way too soon its just an attraction match and i think its more valuable than that i think its been wasted a little bit it will still be a hell of a match i just wish some more emotional investment put into the match right now i feel its more of an attraction something thats new and fresh

3043564 if stella knew the bra was going to be used by hockley there is no way she would have lent it
3043565 it took several months to get there but did it
3043566 that has been a record that has stood the test of time for ten years its held onto that record
3043567 knocking off every other record fastest sprint to 200 million 300 million 400 million in just 24 days
3043568 this film is now up to 441 5 million probably by the end of the week itll beat star wars which is at 461 to become the second highest grossing movie all time in less than a month thats really amazing
3043569 will it beat titanic i dont think so i think itll ultimately be at somewhere around 520 million domestically thats still amazing and to do it this fast ive never seen anything like it
3043570 the repeat business and its become a cultural phenomenon that made titanic such a huge hit back in 1997 and 98 when it was playing for all those months and dark knight with the late heath ledgers performance its kind of a legendary performance its shrouded in mystique and that is really getting people talking and theyre going back to see it over and over again to relive that performance by heath ledger
3043571 the comic book genre is not for everyone or superhero movies but this movie is transcending the genre its a great crime epic so im encouraging people who arent really into this kind of movie to go out and see it because its so great although by this point probably everyones seen its it seems like
3043572 you are not allowed into the computer room because you are not a member of the union

3043574 trying to find a venue with plenty of parking so itll probably be on the peninsula
3043575 i dont think youd want to call an end to this u s dollar rise just yet but i wouldnt be surprised to see maybe a little bit of a pullback as we await some more data later in the week
3043576 i dont think theres any major surprises with the data being on the weak side
3043577 i think the slowdown in housing was probably expected and a bit overdue so were not really taking a huge cue off that this morning because the sting was already felt on fridays employment numbers
3043578 i think theres just a bit of fatigue in the canadian bond market
3043579 weve priced in two cuts by the bank of canada so if anything canada may look a little stretched here on a valuation basis
3043580 i was very firm with vladimir putin he and i have got a good relationship just like i was firm with the russian president
3043581 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn you know bombing outside of south ossetia
3043582 i was just interesting to me that here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
3043583 its one of those things where personally i like the long drawn out storylines
3043584 i think a match like that deserves the fans emotional investment its way too soon its just an attraction match and i think its more valuable than that i think its been wasted a little bit it will still be a hell of a match i just wish some more emotional investment put into the match right now i feel its more of an attraction something thats new and fresh
3043585 this provocation was aimed at occupying south ossetia abkhazia and then all of georgia
3043586 is no longer a man that we can deal with
3043587 he must be punished for breaching international law he is responsible for many war crimes
3043588 nobody was listening and this is the result we have finally come to it however russia will of course carry out its peacekeeping mission to its logical end
3043589 and were fed better than russians during all soviet history didnt they
3043590 i looked into his eyes and found a man i could trust
3043591 were trying to adjust a aggregation to the time disagreement and so a aggregation of us are resting trying to intend our bodies right effort a aggregation of massages we went out on the town to check it out but besides that we didnt do much
3043592 you meet had to smile because you couldnt indite it any better
3043593 growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature
3043594 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
3043595 but every choice they made in that movie was wrong
3043596 the idea was to make an american christ figure but what they centered on was his weakness
3043597 they made him more a lamb of god rather than give us a real powerful superman they had too many scenes where hes being kicked to the floor and thats not superman superman would get up and fight
3043598 the hulk has proven the audience will forgive you and let you redo the franchise
3043599 superman is a character more recognizable than abraham lincoln or mickey mouse
3043600 but no one knows crap about mickey mouse hes a symbol understanding a soul is much harder so dont treat him like a walking american flag
3043601 men of tomorrow geeks gangsters and the birth of the comic book
3043602 superman was created not because america is the greatest country on earth not because moses came to save us from krypton but because a little boy lost his father
3043603 in his first appearances he couldnt fly he didnt have x ray vision he was only bulletproof so supermans not a character built out of strength but out of loss
3043604 when you hear that it puts on a whole new spin on superman and his origins
3043605 the understanding was that batman was born out of traged and superman out of hope and aspiration and it turns out that its about not wanting to lose your loved ones thats critical and it means that we can connect with him hes not an untouchable character bad things still happen to him his father passes away and his powers cant save him
3043606 everybody knows what its like to see the pretty girl and think if only she could see me for who i really was
3043607 past the glasses and acne or whatever but he has to hide and half his co workers dont even know his name thats a critical part too
3043608 it is so much deeper than hes an alien with superpowers
3043609 i never wanted to write a superman movie before but i do now i understand what superman is now
3043610 we are eager to build our boeing fleet with these additional 737s and 767s to meet continued demand for air travel in our region
3043611 todays order is yet another step forward in our strong relationship with boeing we look forward to operating the 787 and benefiting from its advanced performance features however the 767 300er is the economical and logical choice to fulfill our interim capacity targets
3043612 the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified
3043613 most assuredly i say to you unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it remains alone but if it dies it produces much grain
3043614 he who loves his life will lose it and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life
3043615 if anyone serves me let him follow me and where i am there my servant will be also if anyone serves me him my father will honor
3043616 now my soul is troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this purpose i came to this hour
3043617 i have both glorified it and will glorify it again
3043618 this voice did not come because of me but for your sake
3043619 now is the judgment of this world now the ruler of this world will be cast out
3043620 and i if i am lifted up from the earth will draw all peoples to myself
3043621 we have heard from the law that the christ remains forever and how can you say the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man
3043622 a little while longer the light is with you walk while you have the light lest darkness overtake you he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going
3043623 while you have the light believe in the light that you may become sons of light
3043624 last sunday potter took me out driving along upper broadway where those long rows of tall new apartment houses were built a few years ago
3043625 are any other beings ever found in such masses but vermin aimless staring vacant minded look at them i can get no sense whatever of individual worth or of value in men as a race when i see them like this it makes one almost despair of civilization
3043626 t he overall loss of 51 000 jobs reported in fridays u s employment report was not as gruesome as many on wall street had feared
3043627 by the time we arrived at your apartment the blaze had all but gutted the joint still the charred remains of your pet were not as gruesome as we feared
3043628 its not exactly the style you asked for but its not as gruesome as we feared
3043629 since 1911 there existed in england a system of unemployment insurance that gave an indemnity to jobless workers known as the
3043630 no religion spread as fast as the belief in full employment

3043668 the timeframe means that the united states can take action on removing north korea from the state sponsors of terrorism list at any time from today
3043669 we hope north korea will agree to a verification protocol and be removed from the list as early as possible

3043671 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
3043672 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
3043673 the bush administration is expected to delay the removal of the north from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and step up pressure over the uranium enrichment program until pyongyang agrees to a verification protocol
3043674 esto es lo m s hermoso que me ha pasado ganar en mi primer combate en juegos ol mpicos me siento tan feliz
3043675 tengo poca experiencia pero esta victoria frente al turco me motiva y me da mucha confianza a pesar de que mi pr ximo rival ser bien dif cil
3043676 es una lata porque es obvio que nos hubiera gustado ganar creo que jugamos muy bien puntos importantes est bamos ganando muy c modos en el saque y todo se defini por muy poco son cosas que pasan porque al otro lado de la cancha hab an dos jugadores que jugaban muy bien
3043677 perder es parte de esto pero tenemos que estar listos y con muchas ganas para ma ana porque creo que tenemos muchas posibilidades

3043682 the whole existence of traditional peoples in general is dominated by two key ideas the idea of center and the idea of origin in the spatial world where we live every value is related in some way to a sacred center which is the place where heaven has touched the earth in every human world there is a place where god has manifested himself in order to pour forth his grace and it is the same for the origin which is the quasi timeless moment when heaven was near and and terrestrial things were still half celestial but in the case of civilizations having a historical founder it is also the period when god spoke thus renewing the primordial covenant for the branch of humanity concerned

3043687 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top
3043688 but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me what im doing controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil so just pay attention to what im doing and continually try and strive to improve thats the only thing i can ask of myself
3043689 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes so the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
3043690 that to me experience is important but it is also overrated i mean experience now anyone who has played ryder cup in the last six ryder cups has experience getting their butt beat so i mean im not looking for experience

3043693 however we get two throwaways and when i do that im still counting four wins this year which is pretty good lowers has always been a good venue for me it feels like my backyard and it is typically one where i do really well you can never discount any one in any heat though these are the best surfers in the world and theyre all dangerous
3043694 if i had come out of that one barrel then i would have been in the final but ive had a great day and a 3rd place finish really helps me this year the next event is in my backyard lower trestles and im pretty confident out there ill be spending a lot of time preparing for that event but first i am going to enjoy this magical island and all the beautiful waves it has to offer
3043695 it seems like every time i get a bit of confidence going i get smacked back down heat wins are good but i try to approach every round fresh

3043712 a couple of years ago the afghan government wanted to develop a ranger like or a special operations like structure in the military
3043713 the ana were large and laborious the ana is a good army its a developing army but they need a smaller more agile flexible force and so the commandos were the solution
3043714 signal is probably one of the most difficult things to teach the afghan recruits and a lot of it goes back to previous education
3043715 its difficult to explain the background of how a radio works so we try to cut a lot of theory out of it and just take it to practical application this is how it works and this is how you should make it work
3043716 guys come in and you got lumps of clay they really dont know a lot about training and light infantry tactics
3043717 by week six theyre starting its kind of you tear them down and build them up again its the same thing theres a lot of similarities between what we experience in ranger school in the united states and what theyre experiencing here in commando school
3043718 we issue them uniforms boots helmets weapons vehicles radios everything that theyre going to need
3043719 all of this stuff here will all redeploy with them when they go
3043720 you cant expect them to do the job we want them to do without having the right tools
3043721 i want to change the old policy ill go to america ill learn special training and come back here where i will teach my junior officers in the future
3043722 it will help change my country my army everything will be better
3043723 commando forces are like we say the jewel of the army
3043724 its precious forces for the afghan national army we have the best training we have the best equipment and we can conduct dangerous missions
3043725 id say the best way to describe them is theyre steadfast in their improvement theyre dedicated we really do see them as afghani patriots and i think the way ahead is pretty bright their heart is in the right place
3043726 we are doing operations in four different provinces around here
3043727 as soon as we get word that were needed we can get ready in 20 to 25 minutes and can stop any kind of bad activities
3043728 and i think thats why the commandos are so important
3043729 they are afghans they understand the country they understand the history they can interact with the population in a way that no outsider ever could
3043730 we may hide it in a wall or something in our own home back in the united states
3043731 the afghans know they wouldnt hide it in their house theyd keep it away because wed find it in their house so they understand the customs the way people actually do things and it assists us in our planning
3043732 insurgency and counter insurgency is an intimate struggle in the nation and ultimately it has to be an afghan fight
3043733 you need to feed them you need to re supply them you need to give them equipment you need to give them mobility cars trucks helicopters

3043737 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down
3043738 the finding is also interesting from the point of view of understanding why materials are the way they are and what determines their stability and their physical and chemical properties
3043739 you can imagine this liquid looking like mercury only less reflective
3043740 high temperatures make the atoms jiggle around and so people thought that raising the heat would deflect the electrons like putting enough rocks in a stream to block the flow of water
3043741 the scattering caused by atoms was thought to make it harder for the electrons to flow down the stream

3043758 dan roche has perfectly captured the unique joys and heartaches of being a second time dad serious without being somber reflective but not sentimental and with an ever present dry wit great expectation is a must read for new and veteran dads alike
3043759 i loved spending time with dan roche and his family and what an important time it was as they faced life and death with courage humor and grace he takes us right into their house the kitchen bedrooms and backyard to remind us again of the importance of each day we are given his prose is as beautiful as it is efficient now we have a father who has written as anne lamott did in operating instructions and louise erdrich in the blue jays dance about the coming of a child mothers and children but especially fathers will thank him
3043760 i feel proud and satisfied returned to life in your rocking chair by your window dreaming destroying the world as it is now in spite of these deficiencies the wishes the hopes the confidence the predictions the nightmare of real things the fallen wonder of the plague bacillus that never disappears for this is not what i dreamed of

3043770 we developed the lai course in response to colleagues questions about ways to improve lab safety
3043771 its vital that we continually strive to create the safest possible environment for those who work with infectious agents in laboratories and through their work protect the health of citizens
3043772 we have created 12 five minute modules that laboratory staff can easily view in short spurts of free time during their busy days
3043773 i added humor to the course because having been a laboratory technician myself for many years i realize these professionals will welcome some comic relief from the very serious jobs they perform

3043779 the couple met at newcastle university and were boyfriend and girlfriend at the time of the killings
3043780 this is a tragic loss of two young lives and our thoughts are with their families as they try to come to terms with what has happened
3043781 it is understandable after whats happened that theres a great deal of concern in the community and were addressing that with local officers carrying out extra patrols in the area and will be speaking to residents individually to reassure them all is being done to find the offenders
3043782 newcastle is home to people of many different nationalities and we work closely with community leaders and others to foster cohesion between different groups and cultures
3043783 i must stress that newcastle is still one of the safest cities in the country our key aim is to make it even safer for everyone

3043792 with the parliament controlled by the ruling party it is the role of the media to take a critical stance and keep government power in check to serve the interest of the people their readers and their audience it is a very unfortunate thing for all of us that the government tries to bring the media on its side
3043793 considering the situation from president lees point of view the behavior of the media whose chiefs were appointed by roh didnt let the current government work its way it was even to put it extremely pro north korea
3043794 the cost will be high at the beginning of his term but he thinks there will be larger benefits later on the ongoing friction and his falling approval will be temporary and the situation will eventually turn in favor of him
3043795 the international community especially the united states would be best served to engage rather than confront china
3043796 continue to engage the world even on the most vexing and contentious issues
3043797 more remains to be done in order for china to become a respected and responsible stakeholder in world affairs china cannot focus simply on achieving extraordinary economic growth or on fielding a dazzling olympics china must combine growth with grace to create a modern society based on pluralism tolerance transparency and respect for human rights religious freedom and the environment these imperatives are far more critical than the olympics this is a difficult grueling marathon that the whole world needs to encourage china to win

3043804 books can only describe so much about the nature of a certain condition students need to see as many patients as possible under supervision that is how you learn
3043805 it has been unanimously positive the only negative comments have been how come we didnt have this earlier and give us more scenarios please
3043806 and perhaps the most important thing 98 5 would recommend it to other students
3043807 in the end one of the most basic underlying things behind the book the face of death was this i didn t want anyone to read it and come away unscathed i hope i accomplished that but leave that judgment humbly in each reader s capable hands

3043818 how often do you use front row on your mac

3043828 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
3043829 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
3043830 whats fascinating about this study is that you would not expect to find contagious yawning where you did not have self awareness

3043838 ive never had one before sir it was terrifying i thought for sure i was going to die
3043839 sudden jolt inside and your life flashing before your eyes
3043840 i once heard a man say that the reason your life flashes before your eyes is because youre supposed to know before you die exactly why you deserve the death youre about to get
3043841 i dont know it was something like that i might have gotten it wrong but it was something close to that something about purpose and meaning and all of those things
3043842 but yes youre free for the day go home and relax take the day off

3043848 why does that happen i mean i dont know why im asking you i just well you seem to think more about death than most people
3043849 he was close he wasnt exactly right but he came pretty close what i actually told him was that you see your life flashing before your eyes because youre supposed know why you asked for this death
3043850 of course you didnt albert thats why you arent dead
3043851 i told him you know your boss the one who told you about deserving death i told him first and he almost got it right
3043852 i had just talked to him earlier that morning i was stepping out of the house and i got in my car and began driving i passed this exact spot and he jumped out in front of my car i got out we had a talk and then he went to work
3043853 why would he want to do that why would he just want to end it all
3043854 end oh albert i do envy you it doesnt end there
3043855 this stuff all of these things you call life earth these rocks this body its not it
3043856 you could call it that its better called if you just say life because all of this this isnt life its not even actually real wow i dont even know why im here
3043857 here we can go back to the coffee shop i can buy you a drink

3043893 ball aerospace amp technologies corp has released into open source software for analyzing remote sensing data by open sourcing the software
3043894 snapper is a new generation smart card based on nxps infineon smart mx and is highly secure
3043895 snapper uses a triple des encryption with a 168 bit key compared to the mifare classic card that was cracked this uses a single 48 bit key
3043896 the triple des security is standard in financial cards and has been approved in new zealand as a secure mechanism for connection through to the eftpos network
3043897 as far as i know the snapper card is equivalent to the korean t money which apart from its use of the smartmx doesnt have much in common with the mifare or at least the closest equivalent would be a mifare desfire not a mifare classic so it wont be affected by the mifare classic attacks

3043900 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3043901 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3043902 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3043903 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3043904 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3043905 children will not remember you for the material things you provided but for the feeling that you cherished them

3043911 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3043922 younger evangelicals have flooded to new media creating their own nearly invisible social networks
3043923 reporters are mistakenly focusing on traditional high profile christian tv and radio programs overlooking millions of younger evangelicals who are not so quickly predisposed toward particular political stands
3043924 these gen xers yers and millennials are not interested in traditional evangelical broadcasting and are forging new media networks under the radar of news media theyre downloading audio files of engaging sermons from distant churches reading edgy books published by unconventional christian authors writing blogs that criticize as well as support existing christian leaders posting spiritually satirical youtube videos and getting together for social oriented theological discussions over a latte or a microbrew
3043925 evangelicals are realizing that they cannot control their own public identities by silence and that restricting communication to their own tribe has limited benefits

3043936 theyve been with each other 24 7 a perfect way to see if theyre suitable for marriage pauls not about to rush into anything but hes happier than hes been for years theyve got so much in common he knows heather was a mistake although he loves their little one daughter bea more than anything and wont be put off by a bad divorce experience

3044016 even a subtle increase in the psa value at that age is a pretty powerful predictor of future prostate disease and cancer
3044017 right now only one in five men are getting a psa test which is encouraging but i wish the number was higher this research suggests we can do a better job of screening men at age 40 and a better job in high risk men theres a huge population of african american men who are not getting screened and men with a family history of prostate cancer who are under 50 are also not getting screened

3044283 we kept the standards high kept pushing ourselves and we never gave up

3044315 the credit should go to the bowling unit for keeping india to a highest innings total of 329 in the whole series our guys went really hard at them and kept the pressure going
3044316 ajantha was brilliant adding a different dimension to the bowling attack
3044317 he has fitted into the dressing room well and has been very humble in all his achievements which is great to see
3044318 in terms of the bowling obviously mendis was the difference picking up 26 wickets
3044319 with murali muttiah muralitharan and mendis together it is not easy to get runs off them and we kept losing wickets because of the pressure created by the two of them
3044320 the batsmen didnt put up a good show here and it probably cost us the series it was critical the middle order got runs and there was not enough consistency by the batters

3044335 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3044336 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3044337 when i flipped at the 50 and saw how far ahead he was knowing he was the world record holder for a split second a thought crossed my mind there is no way
3044338 but i said you know what this is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts honestly in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got like a super charge and just took it from there it was unreal
3044339 i gave it everything i had possibly but they got me on the end i feel like i should have got my hand on the wall first
3044340 this morning bob bowman had said the french was saying some stuff talking a little bit of trash
3044341 it fired me up more than anything else i told garret and he said you know what were going to let our swimming do the talking
3044342 his last 50 meters were absolutely incredible and he had a perfect finish
3044343 i wanted to go 1 45 and without my messed up finish it would have been that
3044344 its fine i just wanted to save as much energy as i could for the relay
3044345 i said before the relay we were going out there to swim a 400 not a 4 x 100 relay
3044346 were a team it had nothing to do with individuals out there
3044347 when you put the world record holder on the end of a relay and you go in behind him the chance of you beating him is slim and none
3044348 unbelievable is the world i would use thats the biggest word i know

3044351 i was thinking if mccain takes many more falls he might break his hip
3044352 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
3044353 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
3044354 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
3044355 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
3044356 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
3044357 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
3044358 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
3044359 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for ferias hair color
3044360 the moral of this story dont photoshop what aint broke
3044361 that guys a real ass and just acting for tv to get ratings
3044362 instead i will order appetizers and sides spending at least 21 then they cannot say anything if i try one of your tacos
3044363 no no no this is for ohio bred american tastes
3044364 a paternity test is clearly unnecessary because i already know that the father of my child is andrew young
3044365 being in love with a still somewhat dysfunctional married man
3044366 edwards hired her as a front to continue their relationship
3044367 he said he said he just couldnt live with the constant pounding from the tabloids
3044368 admitted the national enquirer was correct when it reported he had visited hunter at the beverly hills hilton last month
3044369 keep this mistake i had made two years previously private
3044370 saiid it was possible some of his friends or supporters may have made payments without telling him
3044371 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
3044372 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
3044373 obviously the convention has not been our driving force behind the story
3044374 perel pauses if the convention wasnt part of the timetable before it is now
3044375 praying that tomorrow will not be as cold as today because she doesnt have the coat to keep her warm
3044376 ok were not hiring him because of his sterling private behavior
3044377 disappearing from the national stage unless he finds a way to squelch this story fast
3044378 a super rich pal who was closely involved with the campaign finances
3044379 this isnt something you would normally see in a newspaper more than once we already wrote the one post quoting the national enquirer which slipped out before pierces ban kf and i dont think youd see more than that if there were no blogs and this was just a newspaper
3044380 its a story that were taking a long view of
3044381 weve got a big exclusive coming out this week and we are on the trail of some stuff thats even hotter
3044382 not about the photos but about the rest of the story and the story is just going to get bigger from here
3044383 everythings done incrementally so im not going to tell you exactly what our process is perhaps my time frame is different than your time frame im not worried about the rest of the media im worried about us
3044384 if you had this rumor about bill clinton it probably wouldnt cause a ripple
3044385 but given john edwards and his public relationship with his wife something close to a model of the perfect family and their perfect relationship it would hurt that much more
3044386 opponents of affirmative action are trying to get a referendum on the ballot here that would do away with affirmative action do you support that
3044387 yes i do i do not believe in quotas but i have not seen the details of some of the proposals but ive always opposed quotas
3044388 i do not have a firm enough grasp on the historical and relevant context of mccains remark in 1998 to give you the pushback that this question deserves
3044389 within minutes of posting yesterday i recognized that it was indeed heavyhanded and had it unpublished
3044390 i may be identifying with elizabeth a little too closely as an oversharing cancer survivor and all
3044391 we dont want to get it at all not even just a mention of the allegation not even second
3044392 edwards isnt considered a likely vice presidential candidate by the press
3044393 its so easy to jump to conclusions and i admit this looks bad
3044394 if the account of him being caught in a hotel rendezvous with rielle hunter was false edwards wouldnt be changing the subject hed be suing
3044395 which story gets a bigger audience a story the blogs run with but the mainstream news ignores or a story the news runs with but the blogs ignore im thinking the news comes out ahead but just barely and at this rate not for much longer
3044396 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
3044397 will mccain respect obamas views once obama has studied the issue
3044398 supposed to be about supplying some needed capital to the subprime market
3044399 the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam
3044400 im a big success and im telling you losers what to do
3044401 you are probably not that good a rapper maybe you are the next lil wayne but probably not in which case you need to stay in school
3044402 i urge you all to stay in school ive seen what happened to friends of mine i know what would have happened to me the odds against people who drop out of high school are not good
3044403 so turn off the tv set put the video game away
3044404 you need to make sure your child can speak spanish
3044405 many americans with good cause didnt believe us when we said we would secure our borders and so we failed in our efforts we must prove to them that we can and will secure our borders first while respecting the dignity and rights of citizens and legal residents of the united states of america
3044406 we resolved that matter of my campaigns structure back in july
3044407 i would bet my firstborn that they will be excluded from the accounting change it would bankrupt them
3044408 unhappy california business won the support of mayor antonio r villaraigosa of los angeles who wrote a letter
3044409 the federal system to check the working papers of new hires
3044410 i find comfort in the fact that the longer im in politics the less nourishing popularity becomes that a striving for rank and fame seems to betray a poverty of ambition and that i am answerable mainly to the steady gaze of my own conscience
3044411 i dont think mccain can afford to do any more major reshuffling without running the risk of key republicans concluding that hes hopeless and abandoning him en masse
3044412 a mid size sports sedan for 60 000 a competitor to the bmw 5 series and jaguar xf
3044413 it would be my top priority yesterday today and tomorrow
3044414 but we also must proceed with a temporary worker program that is verifiable and truly temporary
3044415 in increasingly strident terms his commitment to legalizing all the illegal aliens
3044416 i dont want you to take out of context what i said during the campaign
3044417 s peaking to reporters aboard his campaign plane obama said the actress doesnt have his personal email address
3044418 she sent one email to reggie who forwarded it to me
3044419 i write saying thank you scarlett for doing what you do and suddenly we have this email relationship
3044420 i feel like im supporting someone and having a personal dialogue with them and its amazing
3044421 failed to generate the kind of republican primary turnout typically enjoyed by house incumbents
3044422 keep a more progressive social security program from being seen as welfare
3044423 does a work test keep the eitc from being seen as welfare
3044424 the eitc has fared much better than welfare programs without a work test
3044425 then he said i bet some of you dont know this did you know spanish was spoken in arizona before english
3044426 i didnt call him i called my friend who happened to be with him at the time
3044427 black fathers who arent in the home are much more likely to sustain regular contact with their children than absentee white fathers or for that matter fathers of any other ethnic group
3044428 obama is the greatest nothing this great has happened to us in a long time the only thing we have to worry about is what well have to wear to the inauguration
3044429 hey were contributing all this money but not getting much back in benefits so the hell with this system
3044430 hey this is to help old folks whove worked all their lives
3044431 he stayed for a good almost half hour afterwards shaking hands listening to our concerns talking to us
3044432 pointed out that he supported bill clinton with both ginsberg sic and breyer
3044433 we have seen this before there is dirt and lies that are circulated in e mails and they pump them out long enough until finally you a mainstream reporter asks me about it
3044434 it will only produce an immediate 17 increase in immigration
3044435 editorial staff is about two thirds its size in the late 1990s

3044439 youd imagine that someone like the senator who is constantly traveling and constantly on how can he return these personal e mails
3044440 done a brilliant job of insulating itself for the down cycle
3044441 obama aides also said clinton is in no position to stiffen oversight after taking contributions from mortgage industry lobbyists including funds from representatives of countrywide which has been at the center of the mortgage meltdown
3044442 im glad to report that starbucks is indeed considering some sort of elite status
3044443 we dont comment on campaigns that are utter and complete failures
3044444 you find you can eliminate a fair number of people without eliminating much content
3044445 supported by fed chairman alan greenspan and treasury secretary larry summers
3044446 but we must enact comprehensive immigration reform we must make it a top agenda item if we dont do it before and we probably wont a little straight talk as of january 2009
3044447 mr mccain has made some gains in reassuring conservatives nervous about his views on issues like immigration polls suggest
3044448 there were not all of these pundits and bloggers and everything who were all over it
3044449 you bloggers do a great job digging up stories for us in the msm keep it up
3044450 on a message to balance the crazy left wing things a president obama is sure to try
3044451 what it says is that im not very well known in that part of the country
3044452 sen clinton i think is much better known coming from a nearby state of arkansas so its not surprising that she would have an advantage in some of those states in the middle
3044453 last time i checked illinois was more nearby kentucky than arkansas heck they even touch
3044454 i snt there something a tad condescending in his reference to
3044455 you dont run for president unless you want to work in the administration
3044456 clearly what is going on in brazil is pushing that envelope
3044457 i would never say never but it would be a hard sell
3044458 dont you think theres a major difference between a pol who admits he sired a love child and one who denies it
3044459 voted for george bush i know it for dead certitude
3044460 i know neither actor but i assume they were acting
3044461 unless we enact comprehensive immigration reform i dont think you can take it piecemeal
3044462 because as soon you and i start to talk about the highly skilled workers our agricultural interest people are going to say look we need ag workers too
3044463 we get in this kind of a circular firing squad on immigration reform in the congress of the united states
3044464 and the lesson i learned from it is weve got to have comprehensive immigration reform
3044465 a flake and a poser and an attention seeking diva

3044473 just because life is tough out there you shouldnt rid yourself of competition
3044474 neither is the current economic slowdown a justification for waiving through any application
3044475 the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal with
3044476 i think its important to keep at least a daily flight on all the major routes
3044477 so i think as far as virgin atlantic is concerned we feel that we can get the load factors that we need to keep the airline profitable

3044484 hes voted time and again against raising fuel efficiency standards
3044485 hes voted against renewable fuels and green jobs hes made an exxon lobbyist his senate chief of staff and he has 33 oil industry lobbyists as campaign advisors and fundraises i guess big oil has gotten quite a return on their 2 million investment in john mccain
3044486 i have a hard time understanding where omalley gets the nerve to attack john mccain on energy policy
3044487 electricity rates have risen exponentially during omalleys governorship despite his campaign promise to take on bge and stop the rate hikes this broken promise is just one of many examples of the failed leadership that marylanders have grown accustomed to under omalley

3044504 i tried my best i was hoping to go a little bit faster but nothing i can do now nothing went wrong or bad its just the way it worked out in the end
3044505 i had hoped to get the record tonight towards the end my muscles tightened up but i am hoping that my backstroke will be on form sometimes that happens to me my freestyle is off and my backstroke is on
3044506 unless i get more details about the injury it is difficult to comment on this however i can say it is unusual to have tennis elbow again

3044516 it fails to achieve the right balance between the competing policy interests in this area
3044517 the real risk arising from the implementation of data breach legislation is to trivialise notification obligations in the mind of consumers to such an extent that they become meaningless and ineffective in terms of real data protection
3044518 in fact the potential damage to consumers of a blanket notification obligation could be twofold on the one hand it can create unjustified anxieties and on the other hand it may result in a lack of proper attention to more serious incidents for example if consumers come to regard numerous less serious data breach notification emails as a form of spam
3044519 this could include where an agencys internal processes have dealt appropriately with the person or system responsible for the disclosure and the individual to which the personal information relates has not been affected by that disclosure

3044522 i think its good for the game its something new and i am excited about it and most of my teammates are too
3044523 it gives both teams a second chance of course and it will be interesting to see the tactics we use
3044524 we are happy with that result but it does not matter any more we are in the semis and have to focus on getting past swallows now i dont know much about them but then again we are focusing on how we want to play

3044679 the zar architecture of johannesburg originally part of the public works programme carried out by a reluctant boer government possesses a fascination deriving from its sound architectural qualities as well as from its archeological remoteness the most prominent example was the rissik street post office a wide three storey edifice which defined the eastern perimeter of the vast market square like a nineteenth century version of the renaissance palazzo della cancelleria in rome
3044680 every day of the week market square was therefore a hive of activity ox wagons were parked everywhere and people thronged around the tables on which the merchandise was displayed the new market building a large two storey complex which had replaced the old building in 1890 1 stood in the middle of the square between simmonds and harrison streets it was demolished in 1915 due west of the market building were a number of small one storey structures two tall reservoirs and a narrow tower used by the fire brigade
3044681 yet the structure familiar to johannesburgers of today is substantially different from the original 1897 version the addition of an extra storey in 1905 badly spoiled its looks that addition unfortunately destroyed the original proportions and replaced the charming variation of the roof line with one that was straight and functional dominated by a heavy clock tower and a large square watertank
3044682 for johannesburg to think it is worthy or capable of hosting any prestige event let alone the olympic games is laughable have a good look at that national monument the rissik street post office it is literally falling to pieces instead of being a monument to the past it is a national disgrace

3044733 one can look at the guru of a cult as either everything or nothing the everything would acknowledge the gurus creation of his group and its belief system as well as his sustained control over it the nothing would suggest that the guru is simply a creation of the hungers of his disciples that he has no existence apart from his disciples that any culture can produce psychological types like him that without disciples there is no guru
3044734 the other side of christianity reflections on faith politics spirituality history and faith
3044735 the demand is so strong it may impact or delay the new countries coming on
3044736 customers must comply with all frontier network bandwidth data storage and usage limitations
3044737 frontier may suspend terminate or apply additional charges to the service if such usage exceeds a reasonable amount of usage a reasonable amount of usage is defined as 5gb combined upload and download consumption during the course of a 30 day billing period
3044738 in the past we had a general statement in the terms of service that anyone using an excessive amount of bandwidth could be terminated now were saying exactly what we think is excessive
3044739 but at this point were not monitoring bandwidth and were not kicking people off if they use more than 5gb a month
3044740 in 2009 we will introduce software that allows us notify the customer of their current usage
3044741 and well look at different pricing models that address consumption

3044744 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3044745 iran has the right to have a peaceful nuclear program
3044746 the west should try to find a solution to the iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic settlement
3044747 the language of deadline setting is not understandable to us we gave them our response within a month as we said we would now they have to reply to us
3044748 concluded in the unsc united nations security council and fully and completely returned to the agency the international atomic energy agency
3044749 we postulated that the president of the united states actually took the advice of the iraq study group seriously and tried to engage diplomatically with iran
3044750 im fighting two wars and i dont need a third one
3044751 theres a real danger of any strike not only causing more instability in the region than there already is
3044752 but of actually having the opposite effect of what you want
3044753 generals are more willing to push back against things they think are stupid and gates is more willing to listen
3044754 mullen isnt just saying these things for our benefit i think it is a real effort to communicate with the civilian leadership
3044755 there are lots of opinions about where were headed with iran and a lot of healthy discussion
3044756 but to set the debate along the lines of to bomb or not to bomb isnt a fair characterization
3044757 the views the secretary has expressed on this issue are entirely his own and they are entirely consistent with his colleagues in the administration
3044758 theres a lot about iran that we still just dont understand
3044759 a lot of generals are saying are you sure you really want to do this
3044760 unless its happened in the deepest recesses of the pentagon ive never been involved in a war game that seriously considered a land invasion of iran
3044761 the no 1 problem we have is where are the targets we still have trouble accurately locating all of the pieces of the nuclear program that we need to take out in order to have a relatively decisive effect
3044762 the strait is always the key for war games in the gulf
3044763 nobodys underestimating irans ability to disrupt access to the strait
3044764 people brush over the tanker wars but the navy hasnt forgotten
3044765 they said hezbollah is the a team and not someone we want to take on because they were essentially 10 or 15 times the capability of al qaeda
3044766 conveyed his less than enthusiastic view of an israeli attack
3044767 from an iranian perspective israel would be flying american made f 15s and f 16s dropping bombs made in the usa
3044768 within the pentagon not only do they see the downsides they tend to think that if someones going to do this they dont want to see it outsourced to another air force
3044769 i dont know whether that keeps an operation from happening olmert may want to do this one thing on his way out
3044770 i for one am convinced that its a very real possibility
3044771 regionally there was very strong interest in limiting irans growth and power that we havent exploited as a country
3044772 we could get small concessions and promises to talk again
3044773 but there were no significant breakthroughs or eurekas that made us say this idea is so wonderful that we need to run down the hall and try it right now
3044774 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3044775 without that knowledge an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
3044776 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3044777 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans thats the kind of thats the level of stuff were talking about provocation but that was rejected
3044778 proposed within the united states government in 1962 the plan called for cia or other operatives to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in u s cities to create public support for a war against castro led cuba
3044779 operation northwoods was drafted by the joint chiefs of staff and signed by then chairman lyman lemnitzer and sent to the secretary of defense
3044780 it included plans for hijackings and bombings followed by the use of phony evidence that would blame the terrorist acts on foreign governments reply 491 on august 09 2008 02 34 25 am reply 492 on august 09 2008 06 27 49 am how about some truth mullahs and nukes do not mix wmds do not mix
3044781 we have the courage to correspond with our main allies for what we see as in the interest of kuwait and the region
3044782 it is true that we are allies of america however we are against escalation against iran over its nuclear program
3044783 merely talking about such a closure creates a state of tension and will raise the insurance costs on vessels passing through
3044784 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3044785 having a nuclear weapon goes against their core beliefs and would be more of a security concern then if they do not have one
3044786 the design and production technology used in this weapon is completely iranian and has never been employed by any other country
3044787 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations israel is a sovereign country
3044788 we are in very close contact with the israelis and we talk about the diplomatic track that were on
3044789 theyve said that diplomacy can work here and i know theyre doing their part to talk to all of the countries with which they have good relations to explain why its important to have a tough edge to our diplomacy
3044790 were on a diplomatic course and thats the important thing
3044791 i dont know what the iranians would do without the revenue that they receive from selling oil and so the idea that they would somehow deprive the world of iranian oil exports would have to have a pretty devastating effect on iran itself
3044792 can military strikes destroy irans gas centrifuge program probably not
3044793 this analogy is grossly misleading it neglects the important differences between a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program and a reactor based program and fails to account for the dispersed relatively advanced and hardened nature of irans gas centrifuge facilities
3044794 it also ignores the years iran has had to acquire centrifuge items abroad often illicitly allowing it to create reserve stocks of critical equipment and raw materials
3044795 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months
3044796 iran wants no war with any country and today iran is a friend of the united states and even israel
3044797 it is apparent that iran has not yet perfected uranium enrichment and as a direct result of u n sanctions irans ability to procure technology or items of significance to its missile programs is being impaired
3044798 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered
3044799 an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
3044800 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
3044801 no one really knows yet if and when iran will get the system
3044802 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3044803 the number of mutations neodarwinism requires to evolve a species
3044804 a cave in malta contains so many fossils that maltas present size would not keep this awesome quantity alive for just one week in america a death pit exists near hollywood with eagles doves and approximately two hundred and fifty saber tooth tigers and fifty elephants
3044805 incidentally when the spaniards migrated to america there was not one elephant to be found and not one single horse in america and yet horses have been found buried and fossilised by the hundreds and thousands in america
3044806 the geologic column was formed with great rapidity in a matter of months
3044807 so there is an open cast coal mine in germany that has a tree going through the layers of sedimentary deposit i find that very interesting and a valid challenge however name the place in germany somewhere in germany is not good enough it is rather a large place especially after unification once the location is known then i am sure there will be throngs of scientific experts examining this challenge to their current beliefs
3044808 re the global flood yes we all know that the mediterranean was flooded but that is not a global flood a global flood is impossible well not quite if all volcanic and tectonic plate movement were to stop right now i e no more mountain building then errosion given millions of years would eventually deposit all mountains content etc into rivers and ultimately the sea then and only then do you have any chance of a global flood somehow i cannot see tectonic plate activity ever stopping can you
3044809 they all take a very long time and certainly longer than this mythical 6000 years
3044810 another strawman argument says that sediments can be rapidly deposited well maybe so they can but sorry guys that does not mean that all or the majorityt of sediments have been laid down quickly lets take limestone which is basically something akin to coral like organisms dying and slowly building up layers well we can witness this today but we dont see these layers rapidly building up do we yet again a little piece of creationist information proves to be misleading which of course is the sole intent oh by the way if sediments can be rapidly deposited then that must be happening now and we should be observing the very formation of fossils
3044811 i notice you are still denying beneficial mutation even after the effort that arcana has made to point you in the direction of numerous examples of beneficial mutation how can you ignore this
3044812 anyhow all of this is wasting my precious time and i will have to sign off now
3044813 and i have pointed out that we have in fact seen increases in genetic information and have even given an example of a known mechanism for such increases much like your refusal to acknowledge transitional fossils your claim about mutations only losing genetic information is completely factually baseless
3044814 heres a rebuttal for mark izaaks stupid assertions regarding noahs flood
3044815 why should many fossils buried together come as a suprise and how does this disprove evolution rather it supports evolution but millions i think you are exagerating a tad
3044816 oh go on fusion make my day and challenge me on that topic please
3044817 global flood and frozen fossils in the arctic you really are rambling now i have already explained in simple terms that a global flood is impossible what on earth are you implying
3044818 why should many fossils buried together come as a suprise and how does this disprove evolution rather it supports evolution but millions i think you are exagerating a tad
3044819 put a joint of pork in a pork joint fully intact albeit the meat may have lost some of its flavour and be a bit tough
3044820 the berskovka mammoth frozen remains found in snow perfectly feasible and i remember the discovery of a mammoth in siberia not sure if it this one and it was almost fully intact mammoths have only recently become exinct so why and how does this disprove evolution put a joint of pork in a pork joint fully intact albeit the meat may have lost some of its flavour and be a bit tough yet again totally irrelevent content from this sham of a website in a pathetic attempt to discredit evolution i was going to label s8int as inappropriate but i think i have to use the word immoral
3044821 now if you told me that the fossil bones of a human were found in the same layer as those of a dinoasaur then that would at least be a challenge but i guess your creation scientists are still busy on trying to magic that one up in some remote region
3044822 in various levels of the muck stone artifacts were found frozen in situ at great depths and in apparent association with the ice age fauna which implies that men were contemporary with extinct animals in alaska
3044823 the horse is merely the tip of the iceberg giant tortoises living in the caribbean sea the giant sloth the sabre toothed tiger the glyptodont and toxodon these were all tropical animals they werent wiped out because alaska and siberia were experiencing an ice age
3044824 unless one is willing to postulate freezing temperatures across the equator such an explanation clearly begs the question
3044825 animal tusks and bones rolled up in front of the blades
3044826 as i said before if there had been a global flood there would be a uniform sediment layer and we would find fossils everywhere not just in these isolated locations
3044827 have you ever had your head out of a book long enough to look at a gravel pit or a stream bed has it ever occurred to you what conditions would be like with water above the continental shorelines going around and around the earth pulled by the moons gravitation and swirling due to the coriolis effect didnt think so
3044828 this is another red herring do you have an actual point that is relevant to the discussion what is it about these conditions you claim to have existed supports your claims
3044829 secondly the technology to make forged steel rivets wasnt even around at the time you purport that the ark was constructed
3044830 site medzamor in soviet armenia is of intriguing interest an international scientific report published in 1969 expressed the belief that these finds point to an unknown period of technological development
3044831 medzamor was founded by the wise men of earlier civilizations they possessed knowledge they had acquired during a remote age unknown to us that deserves to be called scientific and industrial
3044832 on putting the two parts together it formed a bell shaped vessel 4 1 2 inches high 6 l 2 inches at the base 2 1 2 inches at the top and about an eighth of an inch in thickness the body of the vessel resembles zinc in color or a composition metal in which there is a considerable portion of silver on the sides there are six figures of a flower a bouquet beautifully inlaid with pure silver and around the lower part of the vessel a vine or wreath inlaid also with silver the chasing carving and inlaying are exquisitely done by the art of some cunning craftsman this curious and unknown vessel was blown out of the solid pudding stone fifteen feet below the surface
3044833 immense volumes have been written to expound our knowledge and conceal our ignorance of primitive man primitive cultures were not necessarily the ancestors of our own for all we know they may be the degenerate remnants of higher cultures
3044834 oh and the kangaroos walked to australia ahead of the predators before rising waters from ice melt cut off the route
3044835 the time of the exodus is known and the pharaoh who was in power that died that year in the red sea dont expect to hear it in a marxist university or the controlled media
3044836 ahmose founder of the eighteenth dynasty and ruler in thebes was the father of thutmosis i of memphis thutmosis ruled as a co regent until he replaced his father at which time he became amenhotep i of thebes
3044837 the only way were going to get action is if those who stand in the way of action come to be perceived as not just wrong but immoral
3044838 its such a shame that it seems these children are already being taught how to be materialistic

3044862 exclusive photos what do kenny irons and matt leinart have in common
3044863 my view is that the united states if we had a stronger relationship with russia we could exercise strong diplomacy to stop this effort against georgia we should immediately go to the united nations security council condemn russias action and then get the security council to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint emphasis mine and possibly at the same time generate some u n peacekeeping troops the problem though is that we dont have the kind of influence and strength in our relationship with russia to persuade them this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
3044864 that feeling of being powerful and sexy in those shoes
3044865 living like you mean it use the wisdom and power of your emotions to get the life you really want
3044866 a natural high that pleasant feeling one experiences during and after a certain activity like running or strenuous exercise has to do with the release of endorphins as well as other mood regulating hormones such as adrenaline serotonin cortisol and melatonin orgasm also produces a flood of endorphins which is what makes us feel calm and relaxed after sex

3044871 being overly active or addicted to working out as a means to regulate ones anxiety
3044872 research has shown that addictive substances like alcohol nicotine and heroin activate a single pleasure circuit in the deepest and oldest part of the brain
3044873 people become addicted to these substances because their systems become used to higher levels of dopamine and when they dont get it feel deprived a drug floods the brain with dramatic levels of dopamine that are not the same as what is produced during a natural high
3044874 but they dont have the same propensity to become addictive

3044934 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
3044935 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every milliliter of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
3044936 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
3044937 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
3044938 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3044939 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3044940 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3044941 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3044942 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3044943 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3044944 it took several months to get there but did it
3044945 that has been a record that has stood the test of time for ten years its held onto that record
3044946 knocking off every other record fastest sprint to 200 million 300 million 400 million in just 24 days
3044947 this film is now up to 441 5 million probably by the end of the week itll beat star wars which is at 461 to become the second highest grossing movie all time in less than a month thats really amazing
3044948 will it beat titanic i dont think so i think itll ultimately be at somewhere around 520 million domestically thats still amazing and to do it this fast ive never seen anything like it
3044949 the repeat business and its become a cultural phenomenon that made titanic such a huge hit back in 1997 and 98 when it was playing for all those months and dark knight with the late heath ledgers performance its kind of a legendary performance its shrouded in mystique and that is really getting people talking and theyre going back to see it over and over again to relive that performance by heath ledger
3044950 the comic book genre is not for everyone or superhero movies but this movie is transcending the genre its a great crime epic so im encouraging people who arent really into this kind of movie to go out and see it because its so great although by this point probably everyones seen its it seems like
3044951 this financing will help position chromadex to support the next phase of growth in our quest to become the premier provider of phytochemical and botanical reference standards to the functional food cosmetic dietary supplement pharmaceutical life sciences and other industries
3044952 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
3044953 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
3044954 it appears the way the numbers have fallen short means that the country liberals with the support of territorians have done exceptionally well but have fallen short
3044955 mistakes have been made in the election campaign i acknowledge that i take those on my shoulder
3044956 look im not going to say that the last few days havent been difficult they really have been
3044957 well we were monogamous the first year we dated i think its important to establish a relationship first before opening it up but were both in our early twenties and we knew when we first met that we were way too young to be strictly monogamous
3044958 being with a couple is one thing but being in a couple and bringing in another i couldnt do it
3044959 other girls i know who are in open relationships often say the funny thing about it is the more you date other people the more you appreciate your relationship and the less you want to date others
3044960 my man will meet one of the guys i am dating and hell tell me later that guys not up to your level he does it in a really sweet way too it isnt like hes trying to put down the guy out of jealousy he truly wants me to be with men who respect and appreciate me
3044961 it isnt easy you have to communicate a lot for it to work i mean sure i have buttons that can be pushed and i can get jealous like if he dates a petite blonde everything i am not its hard not to feel a little jealous but you talk about it work through it and grow so far its worked for us

3044969 when all of the judicial and appeal processes have exhausted themselves if any of the three are subject to a death penalty australia will make a plea of clemency on their behalf at that time

3044973 the search officers with the exception of the search and rescue team dispatched from lisbon had not benefited from any formal training in search procedures
3044974 we are thinking of organising elections which we want to be transparent and democratic
3044975 we are used to respecting our commitments so for this reason we cannot take the risk of giving a date which might not be respected
3044976 i cant say now whether i will be a candidate because it depends on the future i wont rule it out but i am not saying i will be a candidate either

3044991 both murali muttiah muralitharan and ajantha mendis bowled very well and kept the pressure on a good indian batting line up
3044992 i have rarely seen so many injuries on a single day but it is part of the game sri lanka played better and deserved the victory
3044993 our batting let us down as it was not consistent throughout the series mendis was a key bowler for sri lanka and was well supported by murali

3044998 in the past i have said three times that im going to retire without knowing what would happen i never thought that in 2008 i would win a gold medal
3044999 i went through a very low period in my life
3045000 as you grow older you are not as strong as you used to be i was under tremendous pressure
3045001 the first olympic gold was for myself today i dedicate this gold medal for my country
3045002 my most important commitment was to win this gold medal
3045003 its difficult to say what will happen in the future because so many things can change i dont think i want to share my plans for the future now
3045004 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3045005 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3045006 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3045007 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3045008 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3045009 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3045010 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3045011 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3045012 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3045013 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3045014 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3045015 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3045016 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3045017 there has been a spate of clearly unfair sackings and a sharp increase in complaints our reps are receiving about bullying and harassment

3045059 the details of who did what to precipitate russias war against georgia are not very important do you recall the precise details of the sudeten crisis that led to nazi germanys invasion of czechoslovakia of course not because that morally ambiguous dispute is rightly remembered as a minor part of a much bigger drama the events of the past week will be remembered that way too this war did not begin because of a miscalculation by georgian president mikheil saakashvili

3045063 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors

3045069 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3045070 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3045071 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3045072 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3045073 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3045074 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3045075 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3045076 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3045077 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3045078 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3045079 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3045080 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3045081 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3045082 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3045083 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3045084 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3045085 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3045086 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3045087 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3045088 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3045089 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
3045090 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
3045091 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
3045092 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
3045093 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
3045094 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3045095 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
3045096 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
3045097 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3045098 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3045099 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3045100 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3045101 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3045102 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3045103 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3045104 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3045105 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3045106 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3045107 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3045108 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3045109 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3045110 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3045111 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3045112 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3045113 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3045114 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3045115 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3045116 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3045117 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3045118 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3045119 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3045120 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3045121 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3045122 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3045123 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3045124 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3045125 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3045126 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3045127 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3045128 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3045129 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3045130 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3045131 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3045132 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3045133 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3045134 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3045135 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3045136 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3045137 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3045138 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3045139 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3045140 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3045141 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3045142 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3045143 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3045144 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3045145 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3045146 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3045147 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3045148 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3045149 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3045150 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3045151 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3045152 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3045153 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3045154 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3045155 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3045156 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3045157 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3045158 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3045159 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3045160 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
3045161 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3045162 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3045163 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3045164 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3045165 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3045166 just so you all know we did set a record
3045167 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3045168 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3045169 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3045170 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3045171 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3045172 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3045173 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3045174 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3045175 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3045176 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3045177 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3045178 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3045179 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3045180 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3045181 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3045182 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3045183 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3045184 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3045185 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3045186 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3045187 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3045188 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3045189 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3045190 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3045191 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3045192 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3045193 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3045194 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3045195 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3045196 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3045197 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3045198 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3045199 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3045200 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3045201 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
3045202 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
3045203 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
3045204 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
3045205 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3045206 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3045207 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3045208 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3045209 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3045210 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3045211 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3045212 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3045213 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3045214 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3045215 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3045216 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3045217 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3045218 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3045219 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3045220 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3045221 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3045222 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3045223 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3045224 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3045225 by default the packet scheduler limits the system to 20 percent of the bandwidth of a connection but you can use this setting to override the default
3045226 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3045227 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3045228 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3045229 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3045230 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3045231 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3045232 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3045233 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3045234 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3045235 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3045236 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
3045237 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3045238 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
3045239 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3045240 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3045241 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3045242 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3045243 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3045244 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3045245 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3045246 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3045247 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3045248 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3045249 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3045250 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3045251 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3045252 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3045253 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3045254 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3045255 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
3045256 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am
3045257 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3045258 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3045259 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3045260 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3045261 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3045262 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3045263 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3045264 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3045265 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3045266 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
3045267 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3045268 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3045269 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3045270 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3045271 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3045272 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3045273 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3045274 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3045275 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3045276 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3045277 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3045278 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3045279 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3045280 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3045281 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3045282 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3045283 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
3045284 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
3045285 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
3045286 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
3045287 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
3045288 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
3045289 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
3045290 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3045291 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3045292 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3045293 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3045294 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3045295 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3045296 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3045297 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3045298 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3045299 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3045300 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3045301 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3045302 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3045303 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3045304 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3045305 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3045306 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3045307 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3045308 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3045309 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3045310 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3045311 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3045312 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3045313 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3045314 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3045315 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3045316 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3045317 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3045318 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3045319 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3045320 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3045321 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3045322 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3045323 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3045324 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3045325 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3045326 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3045327 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3045328 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3045329 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3045330 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3045331 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3045332 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3045333 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3045334 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3045335 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3045336 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3045337 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3045338 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3045339 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3045340 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3045341 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3045342 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3045343 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3045344 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3045345 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3045346 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3045347 obamas give and take tax policy results in marginal tax rates of 34 percent to 39 percent in the 31 000 to 45 000 income range for this family thats an increase of 13 percentage points or more from the current rates what accounts for the higher rates first obama expands the maximum child and dependent care credit for families with one young child from 1 050 to 1 500 and phases down the credit over a longer income range from 30 000 to 58 000 throughout this income range the credit is phasing out at a rate of 30 per 1 000 of income thus raising the effective tax rate by 3 percentage points obama also makes certain credits refundable which introduces a tax penalty of 10 percent or 15 percent depending on the income bracket while obama has publicly embraced a tax rate of 40 percent for couples earning over 350 000 his tax policies would result in a staggering 45 percent effective marginal rate in the 110 000 to 120 000 income range for this family that is 11 percentage points higher than under current law
3045348 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3045349 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3045350 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3045351 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3045352 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3045353 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3045354 in our funds it has been financial and media stocks that have accounted for a large part of our poor performance year to date
3045355 there is a register fully inscribed to which bear witness those nearest to allah truly the righteous will be in bliss on thrones of dignity will they command a sight of all things thou wilt recognise in their faces the beaming brightness of bliss their thirst will be slaked with pure wine sealed the seal thereof will be musk and for this let those aspire who have aspirations with it will be given a mixture of tasneem
3045356 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
3045357 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south

3045362 currently im using profractional to treat challenging full face acne scars and the patients ive treated report that its virtually painless when preceded by topical anesthetic cream in addition by adjusting settings i can easily control the depth of treatment allowing me to treat deep into the dermis which is ideal for acne scars on all patients i have noticed improved tone life texture and smoothing of the ice pick and crater like scars at 7 10 days follow up after treatment
3045363 after examining the histology of treated tissue its apparent that the profractional heats tissue up to a depth of 1000 m
3045364 this depth of treatment is significant for effectively treating wrinkles and tightening the skin and should provide a significant advantage over current fractional technology
3045365 with only two treatments im able to see definite improvements in wrinkles and skin tone
3045366 the reason patients will appreciate profractional is that it is a comfortable procedure with a limited duration of post treatment erythema
3045367 one of our goals is to add value to our customers systems
3045368 providing a module for their profile systems that will allow them to offer the most advanced fractional laser treatments will increase the variety and volume of treatments they can offer their patients i frequently receive calls from our customers who thank us for providing valuable modules and accessories for their laser that enable them to fully deploy their skills and provide patients with optimal results
3045369 by repenting obeying the commandments of god being baptized we have a chance to return to gods kingdom that is not a given the judgment will reveal
3045370 you can change anything you want but just dont touch the rates
3045371 when you have to manage somebody you made the wrong hire
3045372 is this person the same on the inside as he or she appears to be on the outside
3045373 we must achieve a complex integration that spans the contradictions between inner and outer reality that supports both personal integrity and the common good
3045374 the take home message here is its a big deal
3045375 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
3045376 the plan not only improves the facilities and management of the harbour but it also complements existing features including the iconic kirbys kiosk
3045377 ultimately its all about relaxing on the grass festivals markets ice skating shopping or enjoying our famous views
3045378 go for it mr uhlich you rock but please dont leave your my fav teacher
3045379 this whole genre of model programs sends a very strong message to young people that your main capacity for success in this world is to market yourself sexually
3045380 instead of being part of the solution this teacher is part of the problem
3045381 hes helping to generate these very very toxic messages that are driving young girls to body image problems and eating disorders and other psychological difficulties
3045382 its not the behaviour parents would expect from a teacher who is a role model for students under their care
3045383 the school community wishes rhys well hes a very popular teacher with the staff students and parents and we cant wait to have him back at school
3045384 i love teaching kids but i need a bit of variety in my life
3045385 address the economic problems that are driving hundreds of thousands of young women to think that abortion is their only option
3045386 having a baby is a more moral choice than abortion
3045387 every time i take care of my son it reminds me of her
3045388 he calls everyone mummy because he doesnt know what mummy is
3045389 its been very tough im both a mum and a dad
3045390 marilyns untimely death was at a time when she wanted to live the most
3045391 a major part of operations to force the georgian side the georgian authorities into peace in south ossetia has been completed
3045392 it stops the proliferation of the cells when there is something wrong in the process of duplicating dna
3045393 when there is something wrong with the enzyme it doesnt stop this duplication process so potentially that could be a mechanism to contribute to tumour growth
3045394 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3045395 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3045396 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3045397 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication
3045398 its nothing personal but its very very uncomfortable pretty insensitive and inappropriate that hes there
3045399 if people wont work with mr hutchinson that could cause problems
3045400 it took courage to be a conscientious objector but were not just talking about objection he was actively engaged in talking up the enemy at the time
3045401 its not appropriate for mr hutchinson to be involved in the spirit of anzac study tour or working in the veterans unit
3045402 this is something that happened 30 or 40 years ago in his past
3045403 i was not aware of it and i wouldnt make any judgments today its something that needs to be talked through
3045404 he was senior even to the defence minister he knew everything
3045405 crossing a red line supplying arms to hezbollah in lebanon
3045406 every day i get phone calls from family and friends back in mauritius they have been very supportive
3045407 were looking at video footage from a place up in ballarat but we dont actually think its connected but weve still go to show that to the parents
3045408 its really concerning and very very concerning for the family theyre devastated
3045409 theyre doing the best they can and theyve been offered counselling to help them get through it
3045410 if you see yadav if hes being harboured please call crime stoppers or contact us because it really hasnt changed from yesterday
3045411 weve got more troops on to it now though so were really ramping it up
3045412 its a tragedy and very sad for the family so if we can play some part to help find yadav we will
3045413 if shoaib choudhury was in europe during the shoah he would have refused to drive the trains

3045415 everyone is going to die the only issue is what you do while you are alive

3045417 i just went out i dont want to say i cruised it but i just swam it
3045418 i just wanted to get into the finals and thats all i did it doesnt matter until the finals
3045419 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
3045420 ive never celebrated that much after a race in my life
3045421 its hard to put that kind of race behind you but it sets me up for something good tomorrow the 200 free final thats my first priority
3045422 i started off with the hardest one im just out there to swim and have fun and thats what im doing
3045423 its a great comeback after the disappointment from this morning
3045424 i showed that im still in form this morning i read the race wrong
3045425 a lot of people are like what in the heck are you doing in that but its really nice to be in an event where theres no pressure on me and no ones expecting anything
3045426 it makes me feel like an age group swimmer because i keep improving
3045427 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal
3045428 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion
3045429 even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion
3045430 obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress

3045449 saya datang ke sini untuk sayang sayangan bukan untuk penyidikan pastinya tidak ada seorang ibu dan bapak yang ingin anaknya seperti itu dan sheila sudah bisa menerima kenyataan
3045450 berita yang yang memojokkan dan mengarah ke fitnah itu harus diluruskan seperti can nun telah dituduh menjadi garong dan lain lain semua itu tidak benar
3045451 saya mulanya tidak ingin mau menanggapi karena yang dituduhkan tidak ada benarnya namun karena yang menyuruh isteri saya saya mau berbicara ini sebagai tanda kalau saya tetap cinta dan sayang kepada isteri saya
3045452 semua orang yang sudah menfitnah dan mendholimi saya tetap saya maafkan saya yakin dihadapan allah swt posisi orang yang difitnah lebih dibanding orang yang mengeluarkan kata kata yang sepatutnya tidak harus keluar dari mulutnya itu

3045512 meus queridos amigos eu vou falar hoje da p tria de voc s a b lgica
3045513 colonnese foi um dos autores mais influentes do quadrinho brasileiro
3045514 foi um exemplo de profissionalismo e dedica o nona arte deixar um v cuo que dificilmente ser preenchido
3045515 n s visitaremos algumas escolas para conversar com os professores sobre possibilidades de trabalhar as quest es apresentadas na hist ria em quadrinhos junto aos alunos
3045516 uma delas n o conheceu os pais que emigraram quando ela era muito nova fato muito comum na regi o j a outra os pais optaram por construir a vida na cidade
3045517 a partir do pedido de um presente da crian a aos pais que emigraram eu mostro as poss veis conseq ncias que a emigra o proporciona no presente e futuro dessas crian as
3045518 o que mais me chamou a aten o foi que os pesquisadores procuraram uma pessoa da cidade que visitei que n o tivesse um familiar emigrante para participar do grupo focal
3045519 n o conseguiram achar ningu m e olha que a cidade tem 12 600 habitantes
3045520 ter amigos parentes pr ximos emigrando ou retornando com um discurso revelador das maravilhas do estrangeiro parte do dia a dia dos moradores da regi o
3045521 mas na realidade os poucos caso de sucesso sobressaem entre os muitos fracassos
3045522 eu entrava em contato e a pessoa dizia que n o tinha o lbum pronto
3045523 todo o lucro que a gente tiver com as vendas vai ser para publicar outros lbuns
3045524 eu sempre acompanhei o mercado de quadrinhos e o quadrinho brasileiro sempre dif cil de agradar ou a hist ria ou o tema mas se o trabalho bom vai vender
3045525 esse tipo de gente que eu queria mostrar se voc coloca esse autor nas livrarias vai colar eu tenho certeza
3045526 como se fosse a primeira de uma nova s rie que parte desta que estou publicando
3045527 protu rio 666 os anos de c rcere de z do caix o
3045528 claro que uma honra mas o trabalho tem de continuar ele o pr mio acaba te impondo um par metro de qualidade
3045529 eles me mant m t o ocupado que eu n o consigo fazer alguma coisa por aqui
3045530 sinceramente se voc me perguntar no meu ntimo se eu realmente acredito que aquelas sejam vidas passadas eu n o tenho nada que de fato me comprove isso mesmo implicitamente
3045531 se foi uma jornada ao meu inconsiente ou algo assim isso n o diminui o valor dessa experi ncia fascinante mas o que eu posso afirmar que algo muito intenso e profundo muito mais do que meros sonhos ou exerc cios de imagina o
3045532 a hist ria em quadrinhos contada exatamente da forma como tudo aconteceu narro as minhas idas ao consult rio a sess o de relaxamento as perguntas que me eram feitas e o que eu via e respondia

3045553 no existe ley ni tampoco que el legislador haya previsto situaciones particulares o tratamiento especial o diferenciado de las otras personas jur dicas sujetas al impuesto de la renta cuando realicen hechos generadores del impuesto

3045559 ouch i confess i deserved it lool i have only seen it today
3045560 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play you dont want to play around with teams if you have a chance to make a statement and put them away early you do that
3045561 it was the first time they werent doubling the post
3045562 anyone on this team could do it any given night
3045563 i dont feel the defeat today brings too much pressure
3045564 watching the game from the stands last night really motivated us
3045565 seeing lebron james block a shot with two hands off the backboard and just the way they were playing defense got us ready everyone came into this game knowing the crowd could be a factor
3045566 i dont know where it comes from im pretty clear when we take the majority malcolm is going to be the democratic majority leader i hope to be his second in command his deputy my concentration right now is trying to rise above the fray here and just do everything possible to get myself re elected and help take the majority
3045567 and sometimes i guess being focused and wanting to do that maybe gives people the wrong message but i think ive been very clear for quite some time now
3045568 pull your pants down real quick i have something i wanna try
3045569 what the hell did he want me to do with that

3045573 i did the right things to come out on top
3045574 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
3045575 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
3045576 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
3045577 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
3045578 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3045579 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mind set

3045599 there was one instance where i sought out bobs guidance without hesitation he glanced at his schedule and invited me to his office he was busy learning the ropes of a new assignment having recently been promoted yet he deliberately set aside time for me so we could chat
3045600 bob was always a selfless man who did whatever he could to help people
3045601 bobs passion for helping others was only rivalled by his knowledge and expertise the combination of the two set him apart not only in the fire service but among professionals
3045602 every effort was made to resuscitate him however we do regret to inform everyone that we did lose one of our members today
3045603 it was not a traumatic injury he wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down

3045617 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3045618 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3045620 pretty sweet job went to thailand she might have been from there and had an old lady name that her great grandmother had adopted when she first came to la
3045621 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3045622 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3045623 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3045624 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3045625 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3045626 you offer defiled food on my altar but say in what way have we defiled you by saying the table of the lord is contemptible 8 and when you offer the blind as a sacrifice is it not evil and when you offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it then to your governor would he be pleased with you would he accept you favorably
3045627 but now entreat gods favor that he may be gracious to us while this is being done by your hands will he accept you favorably

3045638 we are accustomed to think of myths as the opposite of science but in fact they are a central part of it the part that decides its significance so we very much need to understand them myths are not lies nor are they detached stories they are imaginative patterns networks of powerful symbols that suggest particular ways of interpreting the world they shape its meaning

3045653 healthcare companies that recognize and calculate the true value of information will have the greatest likelihood of launching new products faster differentiating themselves from competitors and positioning themselves for long term success in a consumer focused healthcare market
3045654 the sticking point however is that better information differs from end user to end user rich clinical data wont have the same value for a health insurer that it will for a physicians practice
3045655 consider the information needed by a patient or physician about a particular disease
3045656 each constituent requires a different view of the dataset but if their needs dont match the available data feeds initiatives that promote transparency will be inefficient and unnecessarily costly

3046085 i think we were a bit frightened that she was going to get 50 points or something so people were attending to her

3046128 south africa played some real good cricket 2 1 is pretty right
3046129 at lords we had the upper hand and then south africa drummed it into us for the next seven or eight days at headingley and edgbaston
3046130 weve tried our hardest but at the start of this new era i couldnt ask for anything more
3046131 the big man had a fantastic game i would rather have seen him get man of the match for this fixture
3046132 with australia here next year its definitely the way me and coach peter moores want to play our cricket
3046133 we went slightly off the boil but you have to give credit to england they had a lot of motivation and a lot to prove
3046134 weve waited a long time for this moment we came with a goal of winning the series and im really chuffed to have done that
3046135 from where we started the series to where we ended at edgbaston i think we came a long way

3046147 he could have easily given his tasks in the field to another individual instead bob chose to aid in field operations he died doing what he loved so much helping other people
3046148 when i was no longer under bobs command as a student his door remained wide open to me
3046149 there was one instance where i sought out bobs guidance without hesitation he glanced at his schedule and invited me to his office he was busy learning the ropes of a new assignment having recently been promoted yet he deliberately set aside time for me so we could chat
3046150 bob was always a selfless man who did whatever he could to help people
3046151 bobs passion for helping others was only rivalled by his knowledge and expertise the combination of the two set him apart not only in the fire service but among professionals
3046152 every effort was made to resuscitate him however we do regret to inform everyone that we did lose one of our members today
3046153 it was not a traumatic injury he wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down

3046168 we have consistently underestimated growth this year and the comparison for july is a relatively modest 11 percent so it is possible that july could again substantially exceed our expectations
3046169 in any case we believe that the video game software sector remains highly recession resistant
3046170 we expect july to represent the 15th consecutive month of solid double digit year over year growth with approximately 46 percent growth year to date
3046171 we do not expect software sales to slow down for the remainder of 2008 and maintain our current guidance of software sales being up almost 20 for 2008 we do however expect year over year comps to weaken as we approach the anniversaries of halo 3 call of duty 4 rock band and guitar hero iii

3046184 su prosperidad econ mica ayudando a ayuntamientos y ciudadanos a realizar la importante inversi n econ mica que ello supone y cumpliendo as con la funci n b sica de esta instituci n que es estar al lado de todos y cada uno de los pueblos de la provincia
3046185 es importante ya que en el municipio no contamos con ning n inmueble p blico para realizar actividades l dicas y culturales
3046186 parte de la edificaci n ser un teatro un cine y una zona l dica donde se realizar n actuaciones y conciertos
3046187 la reducci n de inversi n real de la generalitat en los sistemas sanitario y de asistencia social en los ltimos a os est destruyendo las bases de una sociedad solidaria y asistencial construida con recursos p blicos de todos los ciudadanos
3046188 si las inversiones necesarias no se hicieron en la poca de la vacas gordas menos a n se va hacer en estos momentos de crisis econ mica
3046189 va a aprovechar esta crisis para justificar las privatizaciones y los conciertos privados que no son m s que una forma encubierta de privatizaciones
3046190 mientras se dan estas cifras de la insuficiencia real de camas hospitalarias o de tiempo de atenci n m dica media a los usuarios la generalitat se vanagloria de que en septiembre va a conveniar con entidades privadas por 70 millones de euros unas miles de plazas en residencia para personas con dependencia funcional sin decir que estos recursos se detraen de las inversiones p blicas necesarias para mantener el sistema p blico de asistencia social y sanitario
3046191 no ser n gratuitas ya que esos recursos se destinar n a subvencionar centros privados que luego cobrar n a las familias por atender a sus familiares
3046192 es un buen paso para normalizar las relaciones demuestra que el entendimiento es posible y que la censura y el cierre de repetidores como ha hecho el gobierno del pp no es el camino en una europa democr tica

3046196 son inexplicables las m s de dos d cadas de incomunicaci n entre dos territorios que en materia cultural y ling stica pueden cooperar
3046197 ahora pueden comenzar a colaborar y a establecer mecanismos por construir unas nuevas relaciones entre las dos televisiones
3046198 no debemos olvidar que gran parte de los tratamientos practicados no est n incluidos entre los que presta el sistema p blico de salud por ello un importante n mero de familias valencianas han resultado altamente beneficiadas no s lo por la mejora econ mica que supone recibir de forma gratuita una atenci n dental sino por el valor a adido que supone que estos ni os hayan sido formados en h bitos buco dentales saludables

3046202 en definitiva se trata de infraestructuras que tienen mucho que ver con una de nuestras industrias estrat gicas m s importantes como es el turismo
3046203 pretendemos pese a este momento tan complicado econ micamente para espa a que nuestra comunitat pase lo antes posible esta situaci n y siga abriendo expectativas y oportunidades a inversiones extranjeras nacionales de apoyo tambi n a peque as y medianas empresas de la comunidad a los aut nomos a las familias al empleo a los sectores productivos y en concreto al tur stico
3046204 es pr cticamente el 13 por ciento del pib de manera que el 14 por ciento del empleo en nuestra comunitat lo genera el turismo y por tanto nuestra apuesta por el turismo es de estrategia en todos los campos
3046205 se han efectuado inversiones de cerca 40 millones de euros en un centro cultural que recoge un centro de congresos un auditorio para m sica
3046206 seguir potenciando en el futuro que es el turismo cultural de congresos de conferencias un edificio destinado tambi n a la formaci n innovaci n y a la investigaci n en el sector tur stico

3046210 no podemos admitir que la ratio de camas por habitante sea casi la mitad que en el resto del estado y que no se garanticen como m nimo 10 minutos por paciente en las consultas
3046211 la voluntad no escondida por el pp de favorecer a las empresas privadas directamente con la privatizaci n de hospitales y reas de salud enteras e indirectamente con el nicho de mercado que las cl nicas privadas encuentran en clientes decepcionados la atenci n acogida en el sistema p blico al que le carecen recursos porque el consejo de campos prefiere invertir en otras cosas

3046236 a perfect example of why the american notion of a free public education is a bad idea hes nothing more than a wad of protoplasm a deadhead that one i should have failed him but that would have meant another semester reading his bloated prolixity so i promoted him im so ashamed
3046237 i told him there would come a time when those wronged would ask for restitution i never thought you could actually pay in flesh from the buttocks region i thought he made that one up
3046238 we think it was a marionette show when he was perhaps six years old a little horse puppet called him fat can you imagine an explanation of what actually precipitated his later behavior would be pure speculation

3046242 we have decided to formalise our position to fifa and will be writing to them seeking a change of venue
3046243 the safety of the players and the fans must be our primary concern we will of course monitor the situation carefully but at this stage we cannot be assured of our safety in georgia
3046244 we will work with fifa uefa and the georgian fa to help in whatever way we can to make sure the game does not become a casualty of what is a very sad and difficult situation
3046245 we are discussing the final venue but it will be played in either baku in azerbaijan or abovyan in armenia
3046246 it was a very hard fought series that drained a lot out of us
3046247 we showed a lot of character especially to come back after the galle test
3046248 i am very happy with the players because they played really good cricket throughout the series
3046249 we kept the standards high kept pushing ourselves and we never gave up
3046250 credit should go to the whole team i thought the difference was that we had a lot of contributions from different players throughout the series
3046251 whenever we were in a situation that we needed somebody to put their hand up do something for us they did it thats probably the most pleasing thing for me
3046252 the credit should go to the bowling unit for keeping india to a highest innings total of 329 in the whole series our guys went really hard at them and kept the pressure going
3046253 ajantha was brilliant adding a different dimension to the bowling attack
3046254 he has fitted into the dressing room well and has been very humble in all his achievements which is great to see
3046255 in terms of the bowling obviously mendis was the difference picking up 26 wickets
3046256 with murali muttiah muralitharan and mendis together it is not easy to get runs off them and we kept losing wickets because of the pressure created by the two of them
3046257 the batsmen didnt put up a good show here and it probably cost us the series
3046258 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3046259 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time ive never seen anything like this in my career for software

3046263 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that
3046264 we think going forward the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
3046265 the problem is that the other platforms lack a central store that people can easily go to that theyve already done business with and make purchases quickly from the store to the device
3046266 we are seeing a stream of attacks through links that tempt you to watch a video peoples alarm bells should be ringing when they receive unsolicited messages like this especially if they are told to install code
3046267 since they have not succeeded in breaking my spirit the masks fell and we came to this arbitrary and illegal decision that tramples on any notion of justice and equity
3046268 it is these totalitarian practices and decisions that bring the sporting spirit and the olympic ideal that my country gave birth to into disrepute
3046269 the way the whole thing was manipulated there is no time we would have to seek an injunction against the events taking place and katerina certainly did not want that

3046282 dont buy vanguards total bond market index fund because it contains mortgage backed securities
3046283 this fund is an excellent choice to anchor most investors bond portfolios especially those unwilling to take on substantial credit risk it boasts low expenses broad diversification and experienced management
3046284 compare the growth of a hypothetical 10 000 investment in this fund with the growth of the same amount in up to 2 other vanguard funds and a benchmark to get an accurate comparison choose a time range that covers the number of years all funds have been in existence move your mouse over the graph to see the changes in returns
3046285 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
3046286 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds
3046287 the key to the competition is not only to attack but also to defend
3046288 brazil is known as a strong attacking team but we are a good defensive team as well
3046289 its something that is from start to finish in every game we go out with the mind set that we are not going to surrender a goal and it is something we do from our forwards back to our defenders
3046290 brazil never takes any match as a friendly match we will approach this one as we do all of our matches

3046306 the only thing standing between nova scotia power and a rate increase is the utilities and review board this is protection in name only because the game gets played like this ns power wants a 7 increase so they apply for a 15 increase the uarb protects the public by granting a 7 increase if the cost of carbon goes up by 10 per ton per year over the first four years there will probably be four annual rate hike requests much inflated having the effect of passing all of this cost on to the consumer

3046320 i think the rallye deutschland will be quite a difficult event the weather conditions are always changing and that will make it quite difficult for us to find good and consistent grip
3046321 although theres a high quality field though i still think a podium is possible our key rivals will be absent but the other c2 super 1600 drivers are certain to provide some stern opposition for the top places
3046322 given our position in the championship we cant afford to make any mistakes so our goal will be to finish as high up the order as we can without attempting the impossible
3046323 brno is a nice track but its demanding too a bit like mugello and phillip island two of my favourites in 250 i was on the podium and last year we won so with the bike performing as it has been lately we should be able to fight for good results again
3046324 weve still got quite a few points to make up in the championship which wont be easy gut the whole team are working so hard and well give it our best shot after that whatever will be will be

3046351 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3046352 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3046353 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3046414 what is the ultimate proof of indian citizenship if even a foreigner can get an indian passport
3046415 a passport is a document issued by our government permitting us to travel to other countries how many countries will agree to give us visas on our passports once it becomes known that even a foreigner or a terrorist from another country can acquire an indian passport without verification
3046416 let alone admitting to the fact that more and more bangladeshi nationals are getting themselves registered as indian citizens thanks to their easy access to crucial documents like ration cards and even passports the state government seems to be reluctant even to admit the presence of infiltrators and has all along been maintaining a casual approach on the issue if the state government needed any further proof of cross border influx as also the evil designs behind the infiltration the high court ruling should wake it up from its slumber
3046417 if the government is really serious in detection and deportation of foreigners without harassment of genuine indian citizens the process of updating the national register of citizens nrc should be expedited and photo identity cards should be given to all genuine indian citizens on the basis of that

3046422 the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal with
3046423 i think its important to keep at least a daily flight on all the major routes

3046520 he could have easily given his tasks in the field to another individual instead bob chose to aid in field operations he died doing what he loved so much helping other people
3046521 when i was no longer under bobs command as a student his door remained wide open to me
3046522 there was one instance where i sought out bobs guidance without hesitation he glanced at his schedule and invited me to his office he was busy learning the ropes of a new assignment having recently been promoted yet he deliberately set aside time for me so we could chat
3046523 bob was always a selfless man who did whatever he could to help people
3046524 bobs passion for helping others was only rivalled by his knowledge and expertise the combination of the two set him apart not only in the fire service but among professionals

3046563 that might be the most incredible relay split i have seen in my entire life
3046564 one thing that is great about these olympics is that yao is playing
3046565 look i had five dunks and the last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17
3046566 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
3046567 this is the biggest individual sports story of all time
3046568 mark my words in two or three years hell be bigger than tiger woods or michael jordan

3046570 because of him the interest increased drastically and media attention increased drastically it continues to globalize the game
3046571 with all the media attention and just kicking it off for ourselves
3046572 we were excited to play but to have all the extra attention was a great environment to be in
3046573 in general the company releases a new service or version once every several months
3046574 this is when we can do a marketing and pr push between those releases the blog is an effective tool to keep in touch with the market for instance during the first week of august three articles from the quintura blog were featured on the techmeme homepage as a result weve welcomed new blog readers as well as new web publishers who were interested in our product the quintura site search
3046575 my advice for start ups would be to select a segment and write regularly about news in that segment make sure it could be of interest for the industry and not only for company observers the stories must be relevant for a wide business audience
3046576 some major tech blogs regularly elaborate on the stories that were first posted on the quintura blog

3046601 this is the beginning of a new chapter for the dollar as ecb president jean claude trichet and other central banks are paying more attention to the downside risk to growth
3046602 the decline of oil prices is a significant driver behind this dollar rally because it enables other central banks to turn their eyes away from inflation and focus on growth
3046603 likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time
3046604 the dollar is in my view in a genuine recovery

3046611 i want at least one debate with all four candidates so that nancy pelosi has to answer for her record
3046612 growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature
3046613 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
3046614 its unusual but we really wanted to do what was right for kids
3046615 it is exciting to see a district be able to do this
3046616 it has happened here and there but it certainly isnt prevalent especially in these budget cutting days
3046617 teacher contact time is so important to student achievement every minute counts
3046618 we have kids not learning at high enough levels and part of that is that we need more time with them
3046619 for a while there a lot of things were not certain
3046620 i get to go back to the students ive been working with for a while and im familiar with everyone
3046621 the district cant think well its going to get better because it might not so they have to go on the information they have
3046622 im 45 years old and this is a second career for me
3046623 i was in a position where i never wanted to leave but self preservation kicked in
3046624 we would like the issue completely resolved but weve made progress
3046625 schools are a people job so we try to cut things instead of people
3046626 i live in the same neighborhood i teach in and theyve been stopping by and saying congratulations
3046627 the word charter conjures the image of a break from the district and a break from the union
3046628 we feel it is extremely important the staff have a say particularly in who the administration at the school should be
3046629 the biggest fear was how many more rules would we have to comply with
3046630 ive heard there are other schools in the valley following what is happening at colfax and i wouldnt be surprised if others go that route
3046631 this is whats wrong with the district in a nutshell
3046632 as an affiliated charter all the budgetary stuff is still handled by l a unified
3046633 its the natural thing to do to take one more step
3046634 this gives us freedom to include all our arts and the things that make it easier for students to learn
3046635 it was a shame we werent able to work it out
3046636 this is really for students who dont want a traditional high school experience
3046637 part of the power of this program comes with the personalization students will get
3046638 i was sitting on a park bench prior to my interviews just taking it all in when several community members passing by stopped to chat
3046639 everyone was so warm and welcoming it really felt like this would be a great place for me to bring my family and to work
3046640 she has broad experience in the high school setting in a community very much like marin county
3046641 she is very dynamic very energetic very smart and very knowledgeable about a lot of issues we have been looking at like the international baccalaureate program and the professional learning community which is going to make a huge difference for the success of kids at our school
3046642 its based on the notion that teachers are learners as well as students
3046643 it provides time for teachers to collaborate time to plan common lessons and assessments and time and language to talk about interventions both for students who are struggling and those who are gifted its worked in the chicago area for many years its embedded in the culture there
3046644 teaching is my first love and i went into administration with some hesitation

3046851 although wal mart and other non union discount stores such as target and costco are not directly involved in the union negotiations it does not mean they arent bargained with in fact because their presence overshadows every aspect of the negotiations it may be necessary to deal with the non union groceries

3046873 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
3046874 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
3046875 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies

3046888 mining giants such as bhp are undermining collective action on climate change
3046889 the actions of corporations like bhp clearly illustrate that the responsibility for climate change cannot simply be laid at the doors of china and india
3046890 if we are serious about fighting climate change we have to tackle the root causes and those are greed and a commitment to relentless economic growth

3046906 the issue of separate roads different registration of cars driven by different nationalities the indignity of producing a permit any time a soldier asks for it and of waiting in long queues in the boiling sun at checkpoints just to enter your own city i think is worse than what we experienced during apartheid

3046934 on the republican side the endorsement in oregons may 20 election sen john mccain has the national nomination sewn up
3046935 obama has inspired a sense of hope across this beleaguered nation he
3046936 he doesnt have much political experience but neither did a abraham lincoln who ranks as one of americas
3046937 but the editorial board keeps stumbling on two key questions what has illinois legislator or a u s senator and
3046938 clinton seems willing to say anything to get elected she also has the
3046939 in the senate she has achieved influence much greater than one would
3046940 as for mccain his chief liabilities are his age and his temperament
3046941 through four years in the u s house and 22 in the senate he has
3046942 not all republicans will agree with mccains support for the iraq war vietnam
3046943 mccain will be on the ballot in november and a divided editorial
3046944 in the end clinton and mccain are the best choices for oregonians in i hope everyone is doing well and please remind your friends and hillary clinton for there is so much to accomplish
3046945 its been difficult for voters in other states to decide a clear hillary clinton its also a difficult
3046946 obama offers an attractive vision for the way things could be he
3046947 clinton offers a clear eyed view of the way things are she offers
3046948 as impressive as obama appears he is still in his first term in the u s senate and only four years ago was serving as an illinois state
3046949 clinton in contrast is well prepared for the rigors of the white
3046950 clinton regrettably has pandered more to voters particularly on gas
3046951 clinton also was an integral part of her husbands political machine
3046952 yet one thing is clear the next commander in chief will take office
3046953 on the democratic side hillary clinton is the better choice based on her experience and grasp of major issues to confront those challenges she earns the stars endorsement in tuesdays primary

3046963 ive made a statement on tuesday that was hard to make but it was i believed
3046964 turning his back on someone who had been a good friend
3046965 i mean it is true that part of the job when youre running for president is that anybody who is tangentially you know even remotely associated with you is somehow fair game and thats unfortunate because most of us in our lives we meet people we know people some people we work with or we sit on a board with we dont really go vet them and find out all the terrible things they might have done because you know we dont know or what they said to see if its politically correct
3046966 so michelle do you have anything to add to that

3046970 whatever relationship i had with rev wright has changed as a result of this
3046971 the person i saw on monday was not the person i met 20 years ago
3046972 obamas statements in last 24 hours of being passionately critical of wright and saying he was out of step with america were the only choice he had left it was his only option and he seized it well
3046973 this is the problem with washington we are facing a situation where oil prices could hit 200 a barrel oil companies like shell and bp just reported record profits for the quarter and were arguing over a gimmick that would save you half a tank of gas over the course of the entire summer so that everyone in washington can pat themselves on the back and say that they did something
3046974 that assumes the oil companies are going to give it to you thats probably not a likely outcome
3046975 this is so and sos mom we will be talking to the police about the texts

3047032 helping an injured worker get back to work not only assists in the early recovery and rehabilitation of the worker it reduces productivity losses and minimises the impact on an employers workplace injury insurance costs

3047034 because of the funding constraints with universities at the moment it would be safe to say the funding we will provide them in 2009 probably wont be at the level it was in 2008 but its still going to be quite significant

3047064 ah yes sir sir that service has been rescheduled for friday how wonderful that i could be of service sir
3047065 ok was there anyway that i could have been told about that
3047066 yes sir i am making you aware of that right now sir
3047067 lets see sir our technician will be there between the hours of 8 and 5 so glad i could be of assistance sir
3047068 hi i had an installation scheduled today and again the technician never showed up
3047069 thank you sir i would love to help you with that sir
3047070 ah yes sir sir you are the next call on that technicians list how wonderful that i could be of service sir
3047071 yes sir it was but fortunately for our technicians a service is not actually considered late until the end of business hours
3047072 you might be led to believe that sir but you are incorrect because we said so you see we never said that we were using a wooden and literal interpretation of time and since you really dont have anything else you can do about it weve decided to reject this reality that you live in and substitute our own version where late doesnt really mean the same thing
3047073 you are clearly misunderstanding my question i do not care about your business hours your policies your substituted definitions of common words or your clear case of corporate mass retardation i want to know what time i can go home please for the love of god give me a time or i swear i will forget my internal promise to not yell at you
3047074 i didnt have a technician show up on friday and i was waiting from 8 until 8
3047075 was there anyway i could have been notified of that
3047076 yes sir i am making you aware of that now sir

3047143 all the dithering and uncertainty about whether stamp duty will be suspended has hit the housing market hard and is adding to the economic downturn people are waiting for something to happen before they complete on house purchases and hips go stale after six months and the information in them needs to be updated in the current credit crunch buyers are more concerned about obtaining finance for their purchase than obscure red tape an incoming conservative government would scrap the hip legislation completely and lift the stamp duty threshold for first time buyers to 250 000 that would give an immediate kick start to the housing market and help local first time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder however we need action now and the prime minister has the power to give us a hip holiday even while parliament is not sitting i hope he will also put out a firm statement about their intentions on stamp duty without delay as the situation is getting worse by the day

3047204 i have also constantly received news that my life is not safe wherever i travel i have to use bulletproof cars this is the result i got from having volunteered to serve the country the king and the people

3047209 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3047210 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3047211 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3047212 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3047213 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3047214 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials

3047220 this is the beginning of a new chapter for the dollar as ecb president jean claude trichet and other central banks are paying more attention to the downside risk to growth
3047221 the decline of oil prices is a significant driver behind this dollar rally because it enables other central banks to turn their eyes away from inflation and focus on growth

3047240 the most pressure filled trial is nothing like a fight in front of 20 000 people even millions of people
3047241 people think athletes arent that smart to begin with especially boxers so getting a law degree gave me the ability to get some credibility in that regard
3047242 i think its unhealthy to look back and fixate on it
3047243 my medal i think its in a drawer somewhere we dont have pictures from the olympics up on the walls either
3047244 the olympics for me was very pressure filled and i have probably not all that many great memories from it quite frankly
3047245 i was fully expected to win the gold and coming up with a silver was a bit of a disappointment
3047246 it was like euphoria after i won but it didnt take long to say what now how do you beat this in life reaching a gold medal on a podium on the olympic games
3047247 it was kind of a reality check realizing this is only a small part of my life

3047251 one of the realizations i had was this is one of the best educations to try to do all this on my own without any real support

3047270 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market
3047271 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3047272 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3047273 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so

3047317 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
3047318 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
3047319 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
3047320 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3047321 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3047322 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
3047323 when i showed up to work he said something to me that had never been said to me on a set before he said baby girl the script here is not the bible do you and ill follow i got mine you get yours when he said that i knew everything was going to be all right i was happy to have the freedom to make up some funny with him it was simply delicious my working experiences with bernie were so amazing that from that point on i wouldnt have cared if he called me in the middle of the night to come and be in a scene where i didnt have anything to do but sit in the background and eat cereal i wouldve just done it because i loved him like that
3047324 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
3047325 he was one of those comics that was unique because of his approach his look his voice and the content of his material bernie fell into that category of people who were inherently different like when you saw them you knew they were different and when they spoke you knew they were different as comics were all brothers and ill miss him a lot he was a good friend of mine
3047326 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
3047327 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
3047328 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
3047329 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
3047330 he was a genuinely funny and nice guy i say this because prior to working with him on the show i had no knowledge of who he was and how well known of a comedian he was but unlike a lot of people at his level he was very friendly down to earth and accommodating when our paths accidentally crossed about a week later at lax airport he greeted me as if i had been a life long friend and i could feel the genuine warmth and sincerity of that greeting may god have mercy on his soul
3047331 bernie mac will be remembered i met him on the set of b b s kids his words of encouragement helped me to continue to pursue my career in comedy his comedy had an impact on our community and the world he will truely be missed
3047332 bernie mac had the ability to effortlessly make people laugh he was an incredible talent with whom my colleagues and i in aafca always looked forward to covering bernie had a big heart and he will certainly be missed by the members of our organization

3047438 online publishers are producing more inventory than the market demands and risk devaluing the premium nature of their brands particularly in light of ad networks growth and their dramatically lower pricing
3047439 building more effective relationships between publishers and ad networks is critical in the longer term both parties will benefit from gains in ad network cpms
3047440 what this benchmark study tells the industry is that there is a need for more sophisticated yield management on the part of premium publishers for stronger partnerships between publishers and ad networks for development of best practices and more focus on the value of interactive advertising
3047441 our industry is at an important juncture and now is the time for publishers to adopt strategic approaches to the use of ad networks who themselves have become critical players in the digital ecosystem

3047446 i admire him more for doing it when hes 4 13 to tell you the truth
3047447 the stuff that was said to me it was so convoluted that i dont know who hes directing it at i really dont if he had spoke to me i would know who he was directing it at because i would say what are you talking about but until you give a specific example
3047448 im gonna talk to him and a couple other guys and hes used the phrase the starting pitchers like we as the starting pitchers were focused but some other people arent or something thats ridiculous
3047449 one of the things that happens is theres a lot of cliches in the game and every team that ive ever seen that struggled people will say they dont do the fundamentals they dont bunt runners theyre not hitting behind the runner to move runners over they dont do this they dont do that

3047470 the dalai lamas speeches to the european parliament and the us congress gave them a sense that there was more support for the tibetan issue in the international community than really existed western countries would make statements about some social issues but their desire to engage china as it emerged from isolation in the 1980s meant that tibet was never going to be a major obstacle for beijing
3047471 at the time many said that things had never been so good it marked the start of a period which people thought would bring a certain cultural and economic autonomy for themselves as individuals and for the tibetan region as a whole it was seen as an opportunity to revitalize traditional cultures the first noticeable sign of this being when people reverted to wearing traditional tibetan clothes instead of the blue overalls economically the region also now emerged from a period of real deterioration running from 1960 to 1980 which was even worse than the years leading up to 1959 the slump was partly due to a total mismanagement of the regions production which had been drastically altered by the imposition of communes and co operatives these were disastrous for the indigenous economy
3047472 throughout china the post mao reforms have freed villagers to move from their official village residence and allowed them to seek work elsewhere
3047473 in the other model of economic development tibetans would be given preferential treatment for jobs contracts etc
3047474 the debate over these alternatives was settled in the mid 1980s when china opted for the former model the result has been an influx of huge numbers of non tibetan migrant laborers and businesspeople mainly han the majority of the residents in tibets capital lhasa now are han chinese and the secondary towns are moving in that direction
3047475 the immediate trigger was the growing tension between the monasteries and the communist party the government had expected the reforms to bring increased consumer spending but in many cases people simply put the extra money they had towards rebuilding the monasteries there was a big expansion in the number of monks and in some rural areas there were more people going to monasteries than to local schools the government was concerned at this growth and also about the monasteries funding they received large quantities of donations which they did not have to account for by the mid 80s leftists in the cp were pointing to these developments as an example of hu yaobang s liberal policies going wrong and the government moved to restrict the number of monks and gain control of monastic finances this created opposition and it was the monasteries and conservative elements that were the main groups leading the protests in the late 1980s those who went to universities and colleges did not join in the protests at all even now many college educated people tend to think the 80s protests were unnecessary that the reforms were taking tibet in the right direction and the demonstrations did great damage in altering that course
3047476 one of the biggest grievances is that the chinese authorities equate any expression of tibetan identity with separatism the government seems to think that if it allows any kind of cultural autonomy it will escalate into demands for secession this is something the government has to relax in tibet everything from newspapers and magazines to music distribution is kept firmly under control whereas all over china there are increasing numbers of independent publishing houses the joke in tibet is that the dalai lama wants one country two systems but what people there want is one country one system they want the more liberal policies that prevail in china also to apply in tibet
3047477 almost all the top figures in the party today were hus underlings during his tenure there guo jinlong the present mayor of beijing was his undersecretary and hu chunhua the last head of the communist youth league an important office held at some stage by almost all chinese presidents and now acting governor of hebei province was also a former secretary of hus in tibet
3047478 people talked about many things but if you look at the slogans and banners the protesters were carrying there was no explicit demand for independence i think the main issue was getting china to allow the dalai lama to come back to tibet as well as human rights its true that the protests in lhasa were against the chinese government and the party but also against ordinary chinese people who have settled in tibet chinese shops were burnt ethnic chinese were beaten but it was really only in lhasa that this took place in other regions the demonstrators rushed to government offices or communist party headquarters taking down the chinese flag and hoisting the tibetan one ransacking official buildings there were very few attacks on ethnic chinese the reason they were the target of public anger in lhasa and not elsewhere is that the disparity between the migrants success and the status of the indigenous is so glaringly obvious there the chinese own hotels shops restaurants and are therefore much more visible in rural areas by contrast the economic disparity between tibetans and chinese is minimal so there was little resentment based on economic grievances there are of course tensions between tibetans and outsiders in eastern tibet for example farmers supplement their income in summer by collecting mushrooms medicinal plants and yartsa gunbu the caterpillar fungus much prized in traditional chinese medicine now many han migrants are also going into the hills to harvest these things and though the government has tried to restrict this by charging them a fee the profits are still large enough for them to continue locals object to what they see as the indiscriminate way the outsiders collect the mushrooms and fungus claiming they are doing long term damage to the pastures this competition over resources has become more intense in recent years but personally i do not think the demonstrations were principally to do with economic disparities or disadvantages suffered by tibetans rather i think these were defensive protests concerning questions of national identity
3047479 the refugees in india have developed an ideology and forged a nationalistic sentiment such that they have come to see themselves as defenders of tibet and the tibetan people
3047480 the stunning resurgence of tibetan nationalism poses huge problems for the chinese government huge numbers of tibetans still look to tibetan nationalism or independence as preferable to the present situation and they see the dalai lama as embodying their aspirations even though the dalai lama does not call for independence

3047520 when i was no longer under bobs command as a student his door remained wide open to me
3047521 there was one instance where i sought out bobs guidance without hesitation he glanced at his schedule and invited me to his office he was busy learning the ropes of a new assignment having recently been promoted yet he deliberately set aside time for me so we could chat
3047522 bob was always a selfless man who did whatever he could to help people
3047523 bobs passion for helping others was only rivalled by his knowledge and expertise the combination of the two set him apart not only in the fire service but among professionals
3047524 every effort was made to resuscitate him however we do regret to inform everyone that we did lose one of our members today
3047525 it was not a traumatic injury he wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down

3047545 before mvmp stepped in the monument had become dilapidated and uncared for moving the monument to a new community space has ensured its future care and that it is kept in full public view
3047546 the memorial has long been out of sight it was covered by trees and many people were not aware that it was there now it is placed in full view on the newly regenerated village green at warsop vale the soldiers who fought for us are once again being given the poignant memorial we always wanted them to have
3047547 well soon be embarking on an exciting 4 5 million revamp of sherwood baths so we thought it would be wholly appropriate to rename it the rebecca adlington swimming centre especially as it is the place where rebecca made those first tentative steps into swimming

3047549 the renamed sherwood baths will be a permanent reminder of rebeccas olympic success and we hope it can also serve as an inspiration to other young swimmers to strive to match her incredible achievements

3047564 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3047565 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3047566 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3047567 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3047568 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3047569 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3047570 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3047571 who are open to doing something on the production side
3047572 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3047573 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3047574 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3047575 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3047576 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3047577 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3047578 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3047579 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3047580 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3047581 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3047582 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3047583 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3047584 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3047585 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3047586 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3047587 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3047588 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3047589 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3047590 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3047591 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3047592 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3047593 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3047594 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3047595 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3047596 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3047597 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3047598 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3047599 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3047600 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3047601 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3047602 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3047603 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3047604 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3047605 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3047606 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3047607 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3047608 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3047609 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3047610 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3047611 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3047612 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3047613 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3047614 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3047615 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3047616 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3047617 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3047618 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3047619 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3047620 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3047621 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3047622 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3047623 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3047624 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3047625 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3047626 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3047627 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3047628 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3047629 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3047630 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3047631 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3047632 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3047633 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3047634 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3047635 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3047636 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3047637 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3047638 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3047639 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3047640 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3047641 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3047642 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3047643 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3047644 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3047645 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3047646 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

3047673 you need people available every week also you cant really afford multi million dollar actors to do a television series those guys make more during their coffee break
3047674 it used to be in animation you just had unknown actors do the parts the idea of hiring a really good actor tom hanks for instance was a really revolutionary idea
3047675 partly they did it because they were great actors partly they did it cause they wanted to use them for publicity to be very honest with you i dont really think i need to hire a big movie star to publicize my movie i dont need angelina jolie here thats what it comes down to in the end they have two days in the studio and then they have like two weeks doing press they are mainly paid for the press stuff
3047676 wenn wir mehr nato truppen in afghanistan haben bedeutet das langfristig weniger amerikanische truppen dort das wiederum bedeutet dass wir milliarden dollar sparen mit denen wir steuersenkungen f r mittelklassefamilien finanzieren k nnen die unter den gestiegenen benzinpreisen leiden

3047740 after i thought about it i could tell by some of your faces that it came out wrong
3047741 i was very disappointed in myself obviously i always want to do well i had seven innings to think about it and i want to help the team win i hate losing i really really hate losing i guess i wasnt going to let it ruin what ive done in the recent past
3047742 i know that i can do it its just adjusting thats what a lot of rookies have problems doing jobas fantastic hes just a different story a different animal but a lot of guys go through this
3047743 shouldnt shy away from pushing for more democracy transparency and accountability
3047744 update and scale back our dangerously outdated cold war nuclear postures and de emphasize the role of nuclear weapons
3047745 take u s and russian ballistic missiles off hair trigger alert and to dramatically reduce the stockpiles of our nuclear weapons and material
3047746 global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons
3047747 deeply troubling and contrary to russias obligations as a permanent member of the un security council
3047748 negotiate an accord that substantially and verifiably reduces the u s and russian nuclear arsenals
3047749 ability to view russia as a genuine partner depends on whether russia chooses to strengthen democracy or return to authoritarianism and regional interference
3047750 im interested in what russia does outside its borders first i dont think i can as the president of the united states wave my hand and tell the russian people they should have a different government
3047751 pressure campaign to prevent ukraine from seeking deeper ties with nato
3047752 to eliminate the conditions that export terrorism and allow our enemies to thrive
3047753 in connection with the other issues we face in the middle east and elsewhere
3047754 promote further liberalization of the russian economy and should signify full russian acceptance of a rules based international trading system
3047755 theyve moved from being a democracy under yeltsin to being a complete autocracy under putin
3047756 toward nuclear de escalation in an effort to encourage russia to do the same
3047757 scrapping it and building a missile defense system will only invite russia and china to build up should cancel ballistic missile defense plans which he has called
3047758 control some of the loose nuclear weapons in their domain
3047759 is indivisible and that the organizations doors remain open to all democracies committed to the defense of freedom
3047760 again deprived of the opportunity to choose their leaders in a free and open contest
3047761 strong condemnation by all countries committed to the rule of law
3047762 things will be better than during the cold war because much as we do not want another 9 11 putin does not want another terrorist attack like the 2004 school siege in beslan
3047763 a staunch nationalist in a country that has no democratic tradition
3047764 discuss the prospects of putting our aegis missile defense cruisers in the black sea
3047765 land use permits necessary to construct and operate disarmament facilities so nonproliferation dollars are not unnecessarily wasted on facilities that cannot be used because of russian red tape
3047766 strong national defense and a policy of non intervention abroad
3047767 noting the disturbing pattern of killings of numerous independent journalists in russia since 2000 and urging russian president vladimir putin to authorize cooperation with outside investigators in solving those murders
3047768 oppose the russian leadership and you could trip and fall off a tall building or stumble into the path of a bullet
3047769 it was not an unreasonable calculation to go for a rapid win but in the end it was a miscalculation
3047770 the capital tskhinvali is relatively small no more than around 25 000 people and they probably thought they could just take it and be done
3047771 they may have calculated that some people would leave the region and flee north to north ossetia but the rest would stay and the problem would basically be resolved
3047772 the russians have been provoking for a long time and i dont doubt that they stoked up the separatists to start attacking
3047773 at the same time if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily and at this stage it seems uncertain that they will stop
3047774 if the russians hadnt intervened and georgia had taken over some south ossetians would have fled but most probably would have been okay and south ossetia probably would have been better off economically and culturally
3047775 as it is now they are looking at being a small outpost on the southern reaches of russia
3047776 and the trees whisper a gentle no good going trees

3047781 however at this time it is too early to speculate on any possibilities
3047782 to keep fans informed of any updates and advice from these bodies as they become available
3047783 in my 10 years as a professional coach i have noticed that most people even those who seem to be successful on the surface have an awkward feeling that they are falling behind in reaching their goals every day no matter how long or how hard you work the to do list just gets longer its like being on a losing team in a season that never ends by using sports pattern language and seeing yourself as the player coach of a highly visible sports team you can dramatically improve your results and your level of fulfillment
3047784 in order to excel you must be completely dedicated to your chosen sport you must also be prepared to work hard and be willing to accept destructive criticism without 100 dedication you wont be able to do this

3047920 what sundays olympic victory over china like so many of the united states pre olympic exhibitions showed is how wade flourishes in a team system when he can be part of something instead of having to be everything does the heat have that luxury yet no not without a dominant rebounder to trigger breaks not without a proven point guard to guide the offense but what games such as sunday demonstrate is how much of a crime it is not to surround wade with players with such skill sets as a do it all presence wade likely will continue to find himself caught amid a swarm of nba defenders

3047940 will all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years
3047941 hes been able but undistinguished i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done
3047942 kaine was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
3047943 and again with all due respect to richmond virginia its smaller than chula vista california aurora colorado mesa or gilbert arizona north las vegas or henderson nevada its not a big town
3047944 looking at this season at this years squad and the depth and the cover that we have we are anticipating a good year obviously we will be without and andy parr and they are two important players we have to replace from a coverage point of view we feel we have taken care of a lot of gaps from an offensive perspective we have gone out and deliberately recruited offensive minded players there will be stiff competition for places and that will be healthy for the squad overall we are looking forward to 2008 with anticipation
3047945 it will be a real plus to have ryan back his work ethic is truly unbelievable a great individual ryan is the kind of player that you dont realize how important he is until you dont have him
3047946 i am so pleased for him because he works so hard he plays with his heart on his sleeve and he bleeds blue and white his never say die attitude is a great foundation for us to build on
3047947 barkley is still looking for that breakout year and everyone is hoping this will be it we offered him direction and some incentives this spring so it is up to him no one disputes his talent he just needs to decide he wants to play every minute of every game and influence matches
3047948 its a group that is well balanced and fills needs every one of them pleases me in different respects i am excited to see a lot of them play and to see if they can make they step to the next level they are all athletic talented and good players i think some of them will make an immediate impact while others will contribute off the bench i dont believe any of them will need long term grooming
3047949 we dont believe in telling players that they are competing against one another so it will be healthy competition for a starting spot i think there are a few players who could have breakout years and a few with maturity and development could really come on for us there are quite a few offensive types in the mix so it gives us some permutations in regards to line ups and formations
3047950 the best at it i have seen in the college game in a long time
3047951 he is right there on the cusp of things but he must realize how to take full advantage of his strengths he possesses speed and has the ability to cross a ball accurately if he stays focused
3047952 this is the area where we need to plug holes with the graduation of
3047953 its tough to replace seniors especially ones who have played a lot having said that we have a good nucleus returning who will vie for playing time
3047954 he has worked exceptionally hard this could be his time he has to fend off the challenge of and make the job his own everything is there for him
3047955 warren got off to slow start in the spring and had an injury that kept him back a bit but he is determined and ready to turn it around his experience with the national team will be a plus in his favor but he has still yet to play any collegiate soccer he has to prove that he is the man for the job

3047973 comparing like schools with like schools to measure differences in school results
3047974 were not talking about anything as simplistic and silly as league tables
3047975 but we are talking about parents and the community understanding what kinds of students are in schools their socio economic status the number of indigenous students the number of students with disabilities because that obviously means the schools have special needs
3047976 the aim should be to robustly ascertain what mix of capacities and needs children are bringing to their school
3047977 we need this information in order to understand what schools in turn should offer to these students and how governments and communities working together can support schools to do so
3047978 as a nation we should then be tracking attainment knowing that we are in the powerful position of comparing like schools with like schools if two schools have comparable school populations but widely varying results we would be able to ask the question why and ascertain the answer
3047979 we should be able to identify best practice and innovation and work systematically to ensure that they are spread more widely we should be able to especially assist those schools that need it specifically we should be identifying excellent teaching and excellent school leadership we must expect high standards of every child
3047980 there is considerable concern with proposals to excessively tag students and schools with various labels for little purpose
3047981 nsw is responsible for the welfare and education of its students and is committed to the constructive application of the outcomes of assessment in all its forms
3047982 its like hospitals its the rules around that ranking because if youre going to stand in a hospital and its a similar example with schools like westmead and compare it for example with a small district hospital like canterbury and then attempt in some way from the straight statistics that appear on that list to rank those two hospitals you would not be comparing like with like
3047983 public schools nationwide require an immediate 1 4 billion per annum to raise retention rates to 90 per cent and a further 1 3 billion per annum to ensure that all primary school age children reach the minimum benchmark scores for literacy and numeracy
3047984 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3047985 dont allow the fruits of the victory achieved through the sacrifices of the mujahedeen fighting in afghanistan iraq and the tribal belt of pakistan to be hijacked by the politicians who sat passively while the girls and boys of the red mosque perished and burned

3048047 part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month

3048061 i think it is clear that sen obama will announce his vice presidential choice when he is fully prepared to do that
3048062 it is my understanding that every potential vice presidential choice also has a speaking slot so nothing should be read into themes issues and ideas there is an array of talent out there and when the senator makes that announcement you will be prepared to know
3048063 wednesday night is thematically about securing americas future it is about honoring our veterans and the families of our veterans and how to make us safer and move past the divisiveness and into the future i think anyone sen obama picks as vice president will be more than prepared to address those issues

3048111 in the second year of richard the second the king tooke geffrey chaucer and his lands into his protection the occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people
3048112 thought it not out of season to couple some mention of geoffrey chaucer
3048113 marvel s to consider how the bishops condemning and abolishing all manner of english books and treatises which might bring the people to any light of knowledge did yet authorise the works of chaucer to remain still and to be occupied who no doubt saw into religion as much almost as even we do now and uttereth in his works no less and seemeth to be a right wicklevian or else there never was any and that all his works almost if they be thoroughly advised will testify albeit done in mirth and covertly and especially the latter end of his third book of the testament of love wherein except a man be altogether blind he may espy him at the full although in the same book as in all others he useth to do under shadows covertly as under a visor he suborneth truth in such sort as both privily she may profit the godly minded and yet not be espied of the crafty adversary and therefore the bishops belike taking his works but for jests and toys in condemning other books yet permitted his books to be read
3048114 the reformation of the church of christ in the time of martin luther

3048119 as barack obama has said this is not our convention this is americas convention
3048120 and now at a critical moment in our history americans will have their concerns addressed challenges listened to and their questions answered live by our countrys leaders we want americans to be at the center of this convention and americas town hall will allow us to do just that
3048121 millions of americans are facing tough challenges every day from the economy to the war in iraq to the housing crisis to crippling energy costs everywhere you go across this country people are calling for change they know we cant afford four more years of the same old divisive politics that are light on policy specifics and ways to help people and heavy on cynicism and negativity the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need the 2008 convention is about ensuring that those peoples voices are heard and their call for change is heeded
3048122 from monday through thursday our convention program will highlight the people of this country who want positive change and who believe barack obama is the leader who will listen to their concerns and get our country moving in the right direction again

3048144 ive heard that acupuncture is good for stress how can that be
3048145 the syndrome of heart blood and spleen qi deficiency often caused by overwork mental preoccupation or excessive deliberation
3048146 it is true that as a culture we are over nourished over worked and under rested all things that lead to various difficulties digestion is all about movement and good health is about the active movement of cells nutrients and fluids throughout the body so basically the bloating is a lack of movement and particularly in the digestive tract the ultra flora is fine to take though you may find that less expensive generic brands can have the same level of viable healthy bacteria however the bao he wan does work somewhat differently and can be taken in conjunction with probiotics it works at the membrane level of the stomach to promote function absorption and movement so if you were to add bao he wan to your regimen and you were my patient i would recommend that you take the bao he wan long term probably at least 4 6 months even if symptoms subside the reason for the long period is that the symptom is only the extreme result of the slowdown and your body will need time to return to a more normal physiological state the method to take them would be 1 2 tablets about 20 minutes before eating

3048152 highly talented highly collaborative and highly experimental the portland cello project is a dream team of instrumentalists
3048153 to say that this is not your fathers cello ensemble is a vast understatement
3048154 the portland cello project liberate the cello and bring it back to the common folk kind of like those high life commercials where the distro driver self righteously shoplifts beer but you know with cellos
3048155 nobody brings chamber music to the masses like the portland cello project
3048156 no longer are cellists hiding in the wings reliving memories of traumatic junior high orchestra performances gone is the discomfiture of lugging around a huge stringed beast

3048159 he wanted to make that kind of contribution and didnt know how to do it

3048161 it was poverty on top of poverty there were so many people who had given up they just didnt care
3048162 i dont think he knew how bad it was until he came to our area he had to have the tenacity and the patience to train us and sometimes he had to be frustrated
3048163 he says things like do you think we should do this

3048182 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3048183 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3048184 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3048185 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3048186 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3048187 tuesday was a potentially very important day the stock market followed through on a new rally as oil prices again dropped precipitously this bullish signal occurs after a major index hits a low and then experiences a big gain with volume higher than the day before there is a direct correlation between oil prices and the market since the markets lows keep in mind here is the line i say every time a follow through day occurs every bull move the market has ever had started with this characteristic but not every follow through led to a new bull market it is now time to build a watch list of leading stocks that have shown great relative strength during the bear phase and hopefully find them breaking out of bases on heavy volume if none show up this will tell you everything you need to know about the market in past weeks i have told you about the biotech medical truckers but that has been about it for leadership i will need to see more the biggest moves on tuesday were reserved for the areas that were hit the hardest and just trying to make up lost ground be patient take your time because if this is for real leadership will show up you cannot hide bull markets just as you cannot hide the bear markets the one thing i do at this point is to get off the short side meaning any inverse etf whether market based or sector based if this remains a bear market i can always revisit keep in mind the last follow through day in march lasted about 8 weeks and was very narrow with only a few commodity based areas leading i suspect we will need to see the important oil commodity continue to come in for the market to really get going lastly please do realize that in the past 2 days the dow is up 20 points s amp p 4 points and nasdaq 9 points that is how spastic things have been do not believe for a second this is going to be easy

3048193 ive been on the last two relays where we came up short and to be honest with you i was tired of losing
3048194 i was going nuts as soon as he came off that last wall i was going crazy
3048195 we love listening to other people talk stuff about us because it just fuels us
3048196 they had talked a lot about it and we would just rather do it in the pool
3048197 i knew it was going to come down to the end and i was hoping to be ahead but i never lost hope i don t know how i was able to take it back that fast because i ve never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
3048198 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
3048199 alain is wounded when you are the last swimmer in a relay and that you have the opportunity to bring a title of this importance to your country you dont get out of this unhurt
3048200 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3048201 i left it all out there everyone else out there got really fast
3048202 i dont want to go out like that and im definitely not going to go out like that
3048203 im happy for him thats a heck of a swim
3048204 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her
3048205 but i got a bronze yesterday and a silver this morning if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
3048206 there are a lot of guys here sunday and i want to thank them for coming
3048207 i want to thank the giants for inviting all these great guys
3048208 its weird for me not to be in uniform with the dodgers right there you heard me torre i beat you before and i can beat you again i havent retired thank you
3048209 it was nice to see him out there i have always respected what hes done even before there were any questions he won four mvps
3048210 i know the players and coaches enjoy seeing those guys again
3048211 these players watched them and respected them it gives the guys a chance to go through memories about great times in san francisco
3048212 its designed to reflect the true cost of providing service to different classes of customers and also to encourage conservation
3048213 in general the cost of service study we performed was the first one weve ever done this one uses modern accounting principles
3048214 residential customers as a class and seasonal customers in particular are causing our seasonal usage peaks
3048215 but residentials that use very little water 50 gallons per day is our new minimum 100 used to be will see a 24 percent decrease a single family home using 500 gallons or more per day will see an increase of five percent or more
3048216 i encourage people to seek alternative water sources for irrigation during peak season
3048217 large commercials will pay more many small commercials will see a significant decrease
3048218 the seasonal accounts have more operating costs because they exacerbate peak demand
3048219 they are also more costly administratively because we have to close them out and then reopen them each year
3048220 only 10 percent of our users will see an increase over 2 percent
3048221 ninety percent were using 250 gallons or less per day the highest increase is about 28 percent for customers that use 1 500 gallons per day
3048222 she was a phi beta kappa from boston university and a teacher
3048223 she taught for eight years before she got married shes probably the sole reason i got through high school
3048224 this is one of the best if not the best resources we have
3048225 i want to help out but i also want other people to help out as well this is a school thats affordable education opens your eyes to the world
3048226 i came back and the jeep and dog were gone
3048227 rcmp do know who took my jeep but they cant find him
3048228 i have friends from peachland to enderby knocking on doors and handing out flyers ive been to all the dog controls from westbank to enderby and ive put posters up everywhere you can imagine
3048229 then the fifth vehicle wasnt able to stop in time to avoid hitting the car in front of it and that was the first rear ender the sixth vehicle hit the fifth and that created the domino effect of one car rear ending another
3048230 i believe it was the forth and fifth vehicle which caught fire the fire department says it looks like the fuel pump in one of the vehicles got cracked during the crash and thats what started the fire
3048231 whats really amazing is no one was seriously hurt there are a few cases of whiplash but thats it there were four children in one of the vehicles which caught fire but they had all gotten out okay
3048232 drivers need to remember to leave more space between them and other vehicles so that when you come across blocked traffic you have time to stop

3048236 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region
3048237 the company could declare force majeure on its exports from the two ports
3048238 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3048239 losses have been pretty sharp in the last few weeks and theres always someone looking to buy on the dip
3048240 to this effect i am glad to inform you that president yaradua has approved a yearly subvention of n500million five hundred million naira for the centre while our administration has also budgeted about n1billion for its take off
3048241 the usa will be a tough opponent they are a very good team
3048242 but were not afraid of anyone we just want to go out and get the job done
3048243 this was a very good game tonight we made a few mistakes here and there but i am happy with the way my team played overall we are going to enjoy this moment
3048244 i believe that all of my players played well tonight and as a unit they were solid
3048245 we needed to win tonight we didnt have a choice about this so we needed to score goals we talked about it at the half and i told them they should be more relaxed
3048246 amarachi obiajunwa is currently ranked among the top 12 in the world by her qualification for the current games while wilson siewari is ranked among the top 20
3048247 i am trying therefore to build their confidence along that path they stand good chances of winning medals at the current games
3048248 it leaves me having spare with amarachi all the time
3048249 we are progressing and we are hoping that if things stay the way they are we hope to pick up a medal
3048250 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market
3048251 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3048252 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3048253 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3048254 waste managements bid is in line with the 36 38 range where we think the company could execute an all cash bid for republic without issuing additional equity and maintain its investment grade debt rating
3048255 tasted like what macadamia nut and coconut crusted angels taste like
3048256 i came in the mid 80s during a period of time when the agency was very focused on big covert actions
3048257 that was one of my first jobs in the agency supporting that stuff from an it perspective i kind of had that in my blood
3048258 was mainly focused on getting those hf high frequency circuits tuned up right so that you could pass enough of those messages
3048259 they were just text based very simple stuff but very important for operations
3048260 there was kind of a downtime when some of us sensed where are we going as an organization
3048261 being in the it world that was apart of the larger support element here we got hit really really hard
3048262 down to the point where our global infrastructure was very fragile
3048263 we were working 24 hours a day during the war in kosovo
3048264 and i just watched analysts struggle trying to do simple things like trying to get access to information that they needed or trying to communicate with people
3048265 i became convinced that it was a critical element to support analysis and i was convinced that we were not on the right path
3048266 we cant get the work of analysis done without good it
3048267 do all we can with whatever we have on the shelves
3048268 the intelligence community struggled throughout the 1990s and up to 9 11 to collect intelligence on and analyze the phenomenon of transnational terrorism
3048269 the combination of an overwhelming number of priorities flat budgets an outmoded structure and bureaucratic rivalries resulted in an insufficient response to this new challenge
3048270 the global war on terror all of the sudden became the agenda for the agency the sense of mission came back and the idea of being part of the tip of the sword in the fight against all this
3048271 immediately it was do all we can with whatever we have on the shelves get our systems together extend the infrastructure to the best we can and find creative ways of partnering with others just to make the mission happen until we could get enough money in here to start rebuilding
3048272 so we just had to not a negative term slap things together and get them going
3048273 that data outside the cias own network are secondary to the intelligence mission
3048274 di analysts know far less about new information technology and services than do their counterparts in the private sector and other government organizations on average they seem about five years or more behind
3048275 we had a hard time convincing people that obama is funny for a long time our audiences seemed unsure whether to laugh at him the first black president is not a gag but thats changing because hes doing more stuff thats easy to mock and people are more familiar with him
3048276 you know what would look good on my pants an airbrushed portrait of myself
3048277 the painter stopped her work when she heard the noise
3048278 schrijven doe ik met mijn computer ik tik met mijn linkerhand
3048279 stilaan gaat het ik werk drie uur per dag meer gaat nog niet
3048280 we proberen ook zo goed mogelijk iedereen te informeren maar dat is geen sinecure
3048281 er is immers geen eenduidige boodschap voor elke vlucht is de informatie anders en ze verandert voortdurend
3048282 niet alle vluchten zijn afgelast sommige maatschappijen zoals brussels airlines slagen erin hun bagage zelf af te handelen anderen leiden hun vluchten dan weer af naar andere luchthavens en voeren hun klanten daar per bus naar toe
3048283 er zijn veel te weinig mensen om de vliegtuigen leeg te halen en te laden
3048284 wij vragen dan ook meer mensen en een beter afstemmen van de planning
3048285 de sociale pesterijen bij flightcare zijn al jaren aan de gang de directie perst het personeel uit als citroenen

3048293 one puts oneself above all and crushes everything in ones way to get the best for oneself fine
3048294 over time the mortgage market should continue to improve from its current position the number of products will steadily increase and rates will lower with increased competition between lenders
3048295 the standard factors which usually determine the rates at which mortgage rates are set including bank base rate swap rates and libor rates are all much lower than this time last year yet the rates on offer are much higher
3048296 as house prices continue to fall and the risk of default increases the lenders are pricing more for risk and as a result these standard factors are not quite as influential on the rates as they once were
3048297 everybodys jumping on me going whats cheryl like are you two fighting yet

3048309 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3048310 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3048311 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to films the students really liked it and it means so much to them to hear real stories and not watch a cheesy drama like so many other videos

3048314 ive had my eye on ben curtis for a long time and i really believe he is going to add a lot to this team
3048315 i like the fact he won the british open and came back after having a down spell in his career and won those two tournaments in that one year i saw a lot of heart in ben curtis
3048316 ben has got that kind of demeanour we need on the ryder cup team
3048317 hes a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality
3048318 hes the type of guy thats going to just put his head down and barrel on
3048319 ive always had my eye on him i was hoping he played well at some point so i could either pick him or hed make the team and hes done it
3048320 ben curtis played terrific yesterday he didnt lose the pga padraig harrington went out and won it
3048321 the top eight guys have really earned their spot they have played well this year under pressure
3048322 for many of them the ryder cup was forefront on their mind the selection process has worked so far and im really excited about who we have on the team
3048323 the next three weeks are going to be really important for the remainder of the pga tour because as i look at it right now anybody can get on this team
3048324 were playing on home soil and for the first time in a long time europe have everything to lose
3048325 the key to the competition is not only to attack but also to defend
3048326 brazil is known as a strong attacking team but we are a good defensive team as well
3048327 its something that is from start to finish in every game we go out with the mind set that we are not going to surrender a goal and it is something we do from our forwards back to our defenders
3048328 brazil never takes any match as a friendly match we will approach this one as we do all of our matches
3048329 as a separate genre of writing rather i think legal writing belongs to that large undifferentiated unglamorous category of writing known as nonfiction prose someone who is a good legal writer would but for the need to master a different substantive subject be an equivalently good writer of history economics or indeed theology
3048330 didnt scalia just publish a book on legal writing and isnt that why we are giving him this award
3048331 the key to the competition is not only to attack but also to defend
3048332 brazil is known as a strong attacking team but we are a good defensive team as well
3048333 its something that is from start to finish in every game we go out with the mind set that we are not going to surrender a goal and it is something we do from our forwards back to our defenders
3048334 brazil never takes any match as a friendly match we will approach this one as we do all of our matches
3048335 tonight was tinas night but the crowd was cheering so hard every now and then we had to check the score then we went yeah were still up by 30
3048336 oh god i just didnt want to get hung on the front of the rim
3048337 i didnt say were not going to see a dunk these olympics but i was underneath the basket there was no way i was going to go up there and embarrass myself
3048338 ive had my eye on ben curtis for a long time and i really believe he is going to add a lot to this team
3048339 i like the fact he won the british open and came back after having a down spell in his career and won those two tournaments in that one year i saw a lot of heart in ben curtis
3048340 ben has got that kind of demeanor we need on the ryder cup team
3048341 hes a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality
3048342 hes the type of guy thats going to just put his head down and barrel on
3048343 ive always had my eye on him i was hoping he played well at some point so i could either pick him or hed make the team and hes done it

3048349 to think after 20 years that i would be returning to transit is almost abstractly absurd
3048350 transit had become my personal holy grail but now with this collected hardcover edition i can roam free of its gaping wailing and allow it to scab over while i move on to new roads
3048351 while shadowline loves to introduce the world to some of the most exciting new talent bringing in someone of teds caliber at such a major capacity is something were equally passionate about we cannot wait to help bring his most personal works to their completion and look forward to more in the future

3048356 lo tenemos hecho se hace un poco pesado once d as antes de empezar y hay que sacarse este primer partido lo han hecho y lo han ganado bien en nuestro grupo cada partido ganado es importante lo hemos visto con b lgica que perdiendo han ido a todo o nada nos han metido uno pero pod amos haber metido 3 o 4 m s
3048357 b lgica es un equipo de nivel que seguramente va a hacer cosas
3048358 es un equipo muy peligroso con el penalti c rner tenemos equipos que tienen de los mejores penaltis c rner nosotros alemania con zeller por supuesto y hayden shaw de nueva zelanda que hoy ha metido dos por la escuadra cada partido con nosotros es a muerte hay que luchar y meter goles
3048359 en atenas fuimos el equipo con menos penaltis c rner en contra en los partidos de grupo luego en semifinales la cosa fue otra es parte del juego conozco muy pocos delanteros en el mundo que son capaces de meter un gol en la jugada desde un ngulo dif cil bajo presi n pero espa a tiene tres de estos y no vamos a ayudar al contrario haciendo errores
3048360 yo me f o mucho del portero y es mejor que tiren y que lo pare que entrar en el uno contra uno y tener un penalti en contra que luego es tiro libre

3048528 consumers should not have to choose between secret and arbitrary blocking and the very unreasonable practice of metering

3048536 in 2003 mit researchers found the same people are five times more likely to ask a co worker for information than consult the intranet portal or other enterprise subsystem so why do we build km solutions assuming that people first visit a database
3048537 we have already been seeing attacks in the wild for the past two weeks
3048538 playing russian roulette with a gun that has 100 bullet chambers instead of six
3048539 should be to take the gun out of peoples hands
3048540 they are relying on infrastructure that was not intended to do what people assume it does
3048541 what makes this so frustrating is that no one has been listening to what we have been saying for the past 17 years
3048542 dnssec is not an overnight solution for the kaminsky problem but its the right solution in the long run
3048543 das ist zun chst erstmal eine entscheidung der hessischen freundinnen und freunde
3048544 wir sind bereit beratend und mit berlegungen zur seite zu stehen alles andere was an ffentlichen ratschl gen gegeben wird ist nicht ganz hilfreich
3048545 ich bin keine basta politikerin sondern ich frage schon auch die partei welchen weg sie mit mir gehen will ich m chte eine m glichst breite beteiligung auch derer die wahlkampf gemacht haben
3048546 wenn wir den weg gemeinsam beschlie en und ein parteitag die zustimmung gibt werden alle abgeordneten bis auf frau dagmar metzger die ihre meinung auch nicht ndert meinen weg mit unterst tzen
3048547 obviously mistakes have been made in the campaign i acknowledge that and i take those mistakes on my shoulders
3048548 but i still say the reason to call the early election was a valid reason
3048549 if you speak in response to what you understand to be the needs of the community speak in terms that they can understand and provide them with a plan they will support you
3048550 every day i get phone calls from family and friends back in mauritius they have been very supportive
3048551 were looking at video footage from a place up in ballarat but we dont actually think its connected but weve still go to show that to the parents
3048552 its really concerning and very very concerning for the family theyre devastated
3048553 theyre doing the best they can and theyve been offered counselling to help them get through it
3048554 if you see yadav if hes being harboured please call crime stoppers or contact us because it really hasnt changed from yesterday
3048555 weve got more troops on to it now though so were really ramping it up
3048556 its a tragedy and very sad for the family so if we can play some part to help find yadav we will
3048557 what we heard from the environment department today is that for every taxpayer dollar spent were getting 20 per cent less renewable energy now than we were last year
3048558 thats a failure of policy for a government that claims to be caring about addressing climate change
3048559 it has stopped people installing units of a decent size which means were not getting the reduction in carbon emissions that we should and it has failed to deliver the financial stability the industry wants to ensure it has some long term certainty
3048560 the president and i confirmed our commitment to the principle and objective of a free trade agreement between our two countries
3048561 as a consequence of that preparatory discussions and negotiations will be held in canberra
3048562 we are committed to building a stronger broader relationship with korea a relationship that reflects the extent of our shared interests our shared values and our shared goals
3048563 what ive been keen to do with president lee today is to say that this represents a potential new chapter in our relationship we want to get going and this we think represents a good and practical step forward
3048564 aussie beef will always succeed because aussie beef is always better
3048565 what we are looking for in the years ahead is a discussion on that proposal nothing more ambitious than that
3048566 im formally of the view that you either have a discussion which is focused about the future shape of our region or you just let it happen i would much rather be in the business of setting a goal setting a broad concept as the objective this will be a long debate
3048567 i raised this months ago with the premier and the transport minister that i had heard unofficially that this proposal is off the table
3048568 our commuters are here we need public transport to reflect that were still not on par with our inner city colleagues
3048569 this decision condemns the one million commuters a day who use the cityrail network to the same poor service they get now to more years of unreliable slow and over crowded conditions
3048570 even when morris iemma and john watkins plan for the future those promises never appear
3048571 its not a government promise or plan its an unsolicited proposal from the private sector
3048572 you dont just sign up to something because somebody outside of government comes along and goes well heres a good idea
3048573 we havent rejected it but theyve got to refine the proposal
3048574 weve said repeatedly that pensioners are doing it tough in australia in opposition we committed to conducting a formal review of this we have done that within the first six months we will be very attentive to what its recommendations will be
3048575 what this demonstrates to us is that its very important that we get the maximum rate of income support at a level that enables people to have a reasonable standard of living
3048576 what it also says is for those who are under the requirement age we need to get the system right to both encourage and support people to work where it is possible that they can
3048577 money will need to be spent but its important that we get this right because such a significant number of people are dependent on these pensions
3048578 mr rudd is the one who forgot pensioners in the budget and he is the one that should be answerable for it
3048579 the nature of violence indicates that the police are treating the matter as a homicide
3048580 we believe that they are the residents of the house and had been long term residents of the far south coast
3048581 they live a nice quiet life they go to the club maybe once a week and you see them walking quite often
3048582 they are just a nice quiet couple he worked at the petrol station and did odd jobs for pocket money she liked doing her gardening she wouldnt harm a fly
3048583 they moved up from a few houses down the street a few weeks ago
3048584 there are a lot of break ins down here because there are a lot of places vacant houses owned by people in canberra
3048585 the police are kept pretty busy down here in that respect we are all just shaking our heads trying to work out why
3048586 ive had a long discussion with my wife and my family and weve all agreed that after almost 44 years of service in the community i think its time for me to retire from politics
3048587 this is not about simplistic league tables this is about rich performance information about our schools
3048588 we can learn from kleins methodology of comparing like schools with like schools and then measuring the differences in school results in order to spread best practice
3048589 something joel klein is personally and passionately committed to is the identification of school need the comparison of like schools and the identification of best practice
3048590 the answer is not league tables and its not a to f reporting but its making sure we have this rich performance information available school by school
3048591 raising overall student performance and addressing underachievement requires investment teachers know it and parents know it
3048592 were better off identifying the kind of extra value that education offers so that we measure the progress people are making
3048593 this isnt about shaming people or telling people that theyve done badly
3048594 this is about understanding whats going on so that we can help schools that need extra assistance and its only by helping those schools that need extra assistance that were really going to have an education revolution for all australian kids in all australian schools
3048595 failure is recognised and addressed we must refuse to accept that low socio economic status makes it ok for poorer children to fail school

3048652 were literally beginning to bump up against some of the capacity limits on acela
3048653 we have basically no equipment left to start new services
3048654 amtrak doesnt have enough trains to meet this growing demand
3048655 theres the one we run every day and theres the one everybody imagines is out there
3048656 ive heard this rumour a couple of days ago somebody asked me that and that was the first id heard about it its incredibly flattering to be in a rumour i would do it in a second with those guys but do you think its a good idea to redo ghostbusters its a classic
3048657 more and more people are supporting the idea of buying local and direct from farmers
3048658 its just that all those half full nissan sentras arent the most efficient way to bring food into the market
3048659 this incredible creature not people or agencies deserves the credit
3048660 the emergency room program rendered an assist but the fish had to make the real lift despite every mortal hazard the natural and human systems load on them
3048661 folks needs to keep in mind that this is a snapshot
3048662 if you try to infer what the rest of the movie is from one frame to the next you cant do it
3048663 if we dont change anything it will surely erode back down like the chinook and steelhead numbers have
3048664 there will be nothing done with water in the west without there being winners and losers
3048665 theyre going to be hanging over the back of our house and now theres the medical thing
3048666 these people dont dump tons of pesticides or herbicides on their food because they eat it and they sell it to their neighbors
3048667 local growers are coming together and saying theres a demand for local products
3048668 salmonella is it on tomatoes is it jalapeos no one knows where their food is coming from
3048669 at the farmers market if you get sick not that anyone has you can go to that grower and find out what happened
3048670 people from california washington and oregon come from areas where there are a lot of farmers markets
3048671 people are staying closer to home and coming to the market instead of going out of town
3048672 people are not eating out as much and they need more food
3048673 people are becoming aware of the need to buy locally to save on gas
3048674 if people stop to think about how long fresh produce lasts the health benefits itll be worth the cost
3048675 its the standard farmers are selling out it used to be the exception
3048676 its pumped the local economy and has kept the money here
3048677 i explained to my customers why i had to do it my loyal customers know i wouldnt just jack up the prices
3048678 as we move into a new sense of where we are in the community i wouldnt be surprised if i were asked to barter
3048679 i find myself asking do i have enough to sell
3048680 the price to grow corn doubled fertilizer went through the roof and the tractor fuel
3048681 i raised the price to sell corn 25 percent and i feel guilty about it i know how hard it is to pay these prices
3048682 it was a matter of not having enough produce to make up for the price of gas
3048683 putting in our fields cost a third more between fuel seed and fertilizer
3048684 but we are selling more ground beef than high value steaks
3048685 i suspect its also in lake huron but i dont think anyone has looked for it yet
3048686 in my experience if you look for it youll find it
3048687 weve definitely seen substantial changes in the great lakes but we cant tease apart
3048688 we know very little about its effects in the eastern united states
3048689 it seems to be relegated to relatively deep water in the great lakes
3048690 this is something that we ought to become more aware of
3048691 be on the lookout for them so if we do find them we can alert the authorities fairly quickly and then we can tell the public
3048692 that one might argue that they constitute little more than outdoor zoo populations
3048693 cannot be expected to expend funds indefinitely to maintain condors in nature
3048694 progress toward recovery is not sustainable under current conditions because reintroduction of more condors simply increases the costs required to keep wild birds alive
3048695 an extensive outreach effort to rally support for replacement of lead ammunition
3048696 poisoning from ingestion of spent ammunition in carcasses is so severe and chronic
3048697 that condor recovery cannot be achieved so long as such lead exposure continues
3048698 removing lead ammunition is not only right for condors it is right for other scavengers and it is right for hunters and their families
3048699 may be highly problematic california fish and game has done little to educate hunters and non lead ammunition is not readily available or identifiable in many retail outlets
3048700 unlikely to comply as long as lead bullets are easily purchased
3048701 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
3048702 when the climate was warmer there was an increase in the intensity and frequency of precipitation events
3048703 the wet regions will get wetter and the dry regions will get drier
3048704 these tolls should be collected in perpetuity in part to help fund the needed improvements that have long been identified south of the bridges along i 5 and i 205
3048705 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
3048706 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3048707 tough practical and humane immigration reform in the first year of the next administration
3048708 a congestion pricing plan is the most cost effective way to jump start transit improvements and reduce traffic congestion
3048709 for us its a fun thing the reason why scientists are here is that this is exactly what they do for work but they are doing for the love of biology and its fun beer and pizza is a big part of it
3048710 it just shows how little we know our native biology if we go across different ecosystems we find more things
3048711 but if we dont see them we dont count them no one has seen a cougar and i dont think anyone has seen a marmot this year
3048712 its pretty dirty work but its incredible to educate the public and get everyone down here especially the kids
3048713 but its also good to create baselines of the animal species of the area
3048714 we call them squirrel food we scratched back the forest floor a little bit and found them in short time
3048715 we started whistler naturalists about 10 years ago and it became apparent at the start that we really didnt know what species were here you cant conserve a species and you cant educate people about it until you know what is here
3048716 were adding to it every year some are species like lichen and mushrooms which are interesting to specialists though maybe not the general public but then we found the red legged frog last year for the first time and thats a species at risk and that can lead to conservation action
3048717 they are experts in one area of insect study so an entomologist who knows about butterflies will not know much about spiders and so on
3048718 we have 63 mammals on the overall list and weve never had homo sapiens on it so of course we added them so now theres 64
3048719 its fantastic that they are finally doing more to understand the environment and understand how sensitive it is here
3048720 trophy hunters do not go after the very rare cougar that is causing a problem
3048721 were definitely worried about how were going to end the year
3048722 if i dont get to work fast well be in trouble
3048723 were talking about one of the most technologically advanced sophisticated energy projects on the planet
3048724 in my country we have a record of people who have visions and dreams and make them happen
3048725 not the six or seven or eight dollars an hour they are making now just to get by youre looking at 70 000 80 000 even 100 000 a year jobs
3048726 coal to liquids developers have been saying well do something about carbon but theyve been unwilling to put it into their permits its been a lot of empty promises
3048727 you have the optimum oil scenario playing out with prices skyrocketing but you have the bottom dropping out of wall street
3048728 its been tough sledding to try to get the money to build these plants
3048729 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy
3048730 we are selling third party games and they are doing very well and better than our competitors
3048731 there are some things that really disconcert me one is the constant comparisons to my mother the journalists who write this dont ever step back and think how bizarre im comparing a 19 year old i have never met to her dead mother
3048732 do they never think how sick that is its my dead mother and i dont want people writing about that its wrong and its hurtful to keep bringing it up
3048733 this years 9 billion gallon federal mandate will cause an estimated 100 million tons of soil erosion and put 300 000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer into midwestern waters thanks largely to the ethanol mandate and an excessively wet spring
3048734 pollution levels in the gulf of mexico are expected to reach record levels with a dead zone the size of massachusetts
3048735 corn based ethanol is very harmful to the enviroment and if you think it hasnt had an impact on food corn look at the price of an ear of corn
3048736 i wish you people would stop crying every time you loose a dollar in proffit
3048737 i say used cow crap garbage waste sewer heavy waste saw mill waste paper mill waste using a base line food source is just stupiddd
3048738 ethanol or e85 is a fools pipe dream it takes 2 gal of ethanol to do the work of one gal of gasoline it would take 100million acres of corn to produce enough for one year and you think the price of corn cereal etc etc is high now get real folks
3048739 america is a great country come join me to change it
3048740 youre righ candidate i do have it all figured out
3048741 the amount of corn it takes to make one tank full of fuel is enough to feed a man for an entire year
3048742 the business community is screaming for relief at the top of our voice
3048743 with gas headed to 8 a gallon and oil to 200 a barrel
3048744 we have to rethink houston as a happy motoring paradise
3048745 the right plan for us our kids and our planet
3048746 our counterparts in st louis san diego charlotte salt lake city phoenix have all gone through the same thing
3048747 based on greenhouse gas realities and the fact that renewables such as wind solar and geothermal are not yet ready to meet our large scale needs
3048748 our resource options are limited to the three ns nuclear natural gas or nothing
3048749 idaho ranks 13th in the nation for its wind power development potential select areas of idaho are highly suitable for wind development projects
3048750 i hope that will signal to the partnership that they can afford to be a little bit bold here
3048751 there are lots of folks that are going to say its always feasible
3048752 theres going to be other folks that say theres only limited circumstances and heres why
3048753 well follow the two who had accidents but with the amount of miles people rode and as happy as the riders were when they crossed the finish line were feeling great
3048754 even if people create greater supplies of environmentally preferable fish and even if there is more demand for it from consumers the seafood supply chain doesnt always cooperate
3048755 well have the resources to support an all out effort at product placement
3048756 seafood is a large industry but its very fragmented informal and artisanal so people have been hesitant from a business standpoint how do you build a business around that
3048757 sea change has begun to change the opinion investors have of fisheries as a place to look for investment
3048758 thats really important because the transition to sustainable methods requires capital
3048759 theres a lot of concern about what if anything were doing and if we have a plan to deal with the energy issue
3048760 there are two ways of dealing with this increase production or reduce consumption
3048761 most people feel we need to be working on both
3048762 theres absolutely nothing were going to discuss in august that will bring prices down tomorrow except what weve already done
3048763 worked hard to pass legislation to cut our costs of energy
3048764 i dont know how in the hell we are alive
3048765 the goal is to get the smoke up and away from the general public
3048766 the incidence of hitting major populations is very very small and i can prove that
3048767 meteorology is an inexact science but our record is pretty good
3048768 we started getting calls about 1 30 from junction city then veneta and on down to lorane
3048769 you could almost follow it down the valley by following the calls
3048770 ive gotten a myriad of calls in the last two days about field burning and i havent lit a match
3048771 weve been burning on southwesterly winds and were burning north of eugene
3048772 but perception being reality if they can see smoke they can smell it
3048773 the discussion truly is about whether we can burn safely with respect to public health and i dont think we can
3048774 for decades we didnt know that secondhand cigarette smoke hurt people but then we learned
3048775 we are fighting for their right to breathe clean air they in fact are in sacrifice zones and they are subsidizing this practice with their health
3048776 these are oregon summers and people live and remain and move here because they believe the quality of life should be better here than in places like los angeles and san jose and even portland
3048777 if you want farming to be a viable industry in this state you have to let farmers use the tools they need to be able to do it and one of those tools is field burning
3048778 i think theyre making a mountain out of a molehill 50 000 acres is nothing compared to what we used to burn in the 1960s and 70s
3048779 they dont like oil and they dont like chemicals but they force me into using more of em when i dont burn
3048780 i dont think we ever should ban field burning completely
3048781 were not doing it to irritate anybody or make em go to the hospital but i think a lot of the people who are bitching and moaning are whiners
3048782 well fight em to the very end bowers said were not compromising anymore
3048783 yep notin like it used to be oh you mean when the sun was blocked out for the entire day over stayton in the 1970s when we couldnt go out to play for days at a time because them fermers got to keep burnin
3048784 our goal is to create a market response to the global seafood crisis by building a network of artisanal seafood producers both in the wild sector and aquaculture
3048785 we want to take them to new markets they could not reach on their own and build a branded presence
3048786 i want people to think about the producer to consumer connection
3048787 so cleanfish decided to step back and say cleanfish presents loch duart salmon
3048788 right now there is no sustainably produced farmed salmon anywhere in the world
3048789 cleanfish tries to label people as green who are doing something a little better than the bad guys but its still not sustainable
3048790 if sustainable seafood is to grow youve got to be talking about aquaculture because fisheries are not going to be expanding in the wild
3048791 and if we want positive change in aquaculture we need to recognize and reward the better practitioners
3048792 some choices they make arent on our seafood watch card but i dont want to let the perfect be the enemy of the good
3048793 cleanfish is building an important brand the more visible brands like cleanfish that there are the better off we all will be
3048794 neck and neck race between 2007 and this year over the issue of ice loss
3048795 we thought arctic ice cover might recover after last years unprecedented melting and indeed the picture didnt look too bad last month
3048796 and it now looks as if it will be a very close call indeed whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for ice cover over the arctic
3048797 weve never seen any kind of opening like this in history
3048798 it is not only record setting its unprecedented it doesnt resemble anything that weve observed before
3048799 it takes less solar energy to dissipate and melt that ice
3048800 so we potentially could reach a new minimum time will tell if we are going to be approaching the 2007 sea ice retreat there still five weeks of melting to go
3048801 could soon result in an ice free north pole during summer
3048802 the condition of the natural environment in the world today
3048803 were literally printing money on the north slope we decided to strike the balance a little bit more on our side
3048804 clearly from the investor standpoint alaska has become a less attractive place to invest exploration and production dollars
3048805 it was a bad idea in the 1980s and it is an even worse idea today
3048806 increase our dependence on foreign oil and hinder exactly the same kind of domestic exploration and production we need
3048807 what the tax has done is take away all the upside
3048808 i dont think wed have been able to make that investment
3048809 we think that hopefully the new tax system will encourage firms to get on the slope and produce more oil and gas
3048810 you dont want take so much that you discourage activity
3048811 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling
3048812 i think the american people would find that a suicidal strategy
3048813 so republicans are going to tell seniors youre being squeezed by high gas prices and high grocery prices and now were going to cut off your social security checks
3048814 said jennifer crider a spokeswoman for the democratic congressional campaign committee the house democrats campaign arm
3048815 as far as im concerned those bans end sept 30 and if they end on sept 30 fuel prices will head back down on oct 1
3048816 i want to see the most forward looking energy policy for alternatives
3048817 if in order to get that you have to compromise and have the states sign off on whether they want drilling or not maybe thats the price we are going to pay to get it but to have an up or down vote on drilling where does that leave us it leaves us in the same place republicans have put us in after eight years of their policies
3048818 i just have never wanted to spend money on a dryer and the energy it takes to use it
3048819 its a bit more work to put the clothes out on the line but not much more
3048820 and line drying helps clothes not wear out elastic spandex wool they dont shrink or wear out as fast
3048821 i try to be pretty mindful of conserving resources in general
3048822 we try to save resources by sharing and building capital with our members
3048823 the barrier for a lot of people in being energy smart is that it seems like they have to make huge changes
3048824 just like stock portfolios you have to diversify these small changes add up significantly
3048825 flat screens use a ton of energy much more than the analog sets weve all grown up with
3048826 thats one of the things weve noticed when people call in because their energy bills have increased
3048827 we ask them have you made any changes around the house and its usually that theyve put in a new flat screen
3048828 we started the energy calculator this year its a big tool for customers
3048829 you can create what if scenarios and calculate how changes you may make will affect your energy bill it gives you an idea before you install some of those new technological devices
3048830 i wish david would come to see me before i die i hope he will one day come to see his brother
3048831 a few months ago i did a quick interview with entertainment tonight and i stuck my foot in my mouth and said that i was having twins by accident i begged them to edit that out as i wasnt ready for it to be out there then but when i was i would give it to them exclusively
3048832 they really could have ran with it but they said they would not they actually kept their word which i found so refreshing i couldnt believe it
3048833 i really want to thank them for that they are one of the last remaining entertainment news shows that has kept its dignity and high standards in the current morally degraded climate we are now in
3048834 i have not decided on a candidate i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3048835 she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3048836 today we heeded the publics call to deliver a mass transit system that responds to high gas prices and rising congestion
3048837 its the right plan for us our kids and our planet
3048838 time for light rail supporters to pay their fair share
3048839 we have got to get out of the habit of thinking that we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation
3048840 transitioning from our current situation onto a path with declining fuel consumption and emissions even in the developed world will take several decades much longer than we had hoped or realised
3048841 youre going to die but we cant treat you for another 6 months just hang in there itll be alright
3048842 we have a lot to make up but we are in the time frame right now where we will be able to tell if the pinks are going to return to prince william sound and southeast alaska
3048843 if this was the end of the season we would be very short across the board but we still have another six weeks ahead with the exception of sockeye and chum salmon salmon harvests have been lower than forecast
3048844 but the jury is still out on the pink salmon harvest
3048845 the pink harvest has started to take off in kodiak but remains flat in southeast and prince william sound
3048846 we are seeing poor runs of multiple species across broad geographic areas
3048847 that indicates to me it is probably an ocean problem but mixed in with those were a few runs that were pretty good
3048848 we have a great record of making escapement goals which is the main thing
3048849 good escapement goals set you up for a good run in the next years
3048850 has become a much more important part of every boards activities
3048851 thats great but lets see if we can do it faster
3048852 barack wants to focus on new technologies to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling
3048853 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas
3048854 limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
3048855 carries us until the new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence
3048856 the downside is that the methodology is being worked on as we speak
3048857 you can play with those numbers and see how it affects the outcome
3048858 shorter flights have higher emissions per flight because most of the emissions occur during takeoff
3048859 the thing that stood out to me most was that airplane travel was a huge carbon dumper
3048860 a really naive simple guy who doesnt know the first thing about jihad and was just tagging along for the job
3048861 hillary is looking like a square tired old white bitch
3048862 for once and hopefully for all america and hopefully by extension the world chooses integrity over going with what looks good going with the best case scenario going with experience when
3048863 say it obama say that when she and her husband were having marital difficulties regarding monica lewinsky who did she and bill bring to the white house for spiritual counseling
3048864 why am i so exhausted why if i work so hard am i not ahead
3048865 every record for hay prices has been broken over the last 1 1 2 years at both national and state levels
3048866 what is influencing the high prices in montana is it is closest to washington oregon and california where demand is great
3048867 i had calls in from spokane coeur dalene idaho and other places they said at all the spots they usually got hay it was all getting shipped overseas to china
3048868 normally that would mean prices would go down but the impact from the neighboring states and national demand is driving the price premium
3048869 last year this time the big rounds were going for 80 a ton and this year they are 100 to 120 ton
3048870 the prices they are pretty damn high they are higher than ive ever seen them and ive been doing this for 40 years
3048871 there is more livestock and less acres of hay where there used to be hay there is now houses
3048872 starting last year the prices shot way up i think a lot of it was because of supply and demand then the fuel prices
3048873 i think a lot of the hay was shipped out of the area ill probably sell some of my older cows i have to see if there will be any hay available and what my alternatives will be
3048874 you not only use diesel fuel for your equipment but also for fertilizer its kind of a double whammy
3048875 there has been a gradual increase in the number of producers
3048876 were seen a more rapid increase in volunteer users like small landowners with a couple of horses
3048877 a lot of people are starting to sell their horses because of the high cost of hay and feed
3048878 dont let sacramento politicians remove products from your grocery bag
3048879 threaten the safety of our food by increasing the risk of spoilage and contamination
3048880 shall not apply to food and beverage containers designed or intended primarily for consumption by the general public
3048881 what we are seeing is more people filling out requests for financial aid and for those who do more people are qualifying and the aggregate need is increasing
3048882 students who havent needed assistance before are coming in you had to expect that this was going to happen with all the news of companies laying off thousands of people
3048883 we expect uc undergraduates to receive about 1 billion in grants and scholarships from uc this year in state federal aid and other sources and that is about 100 million more than our students received in 2007 08
3048884 it is the economy i tried calling the financial aid office many times they say there is nothing they can do about it they said they just dont have enough federal aid and they dont have anything else to give me
3048885 because my fafsa free application for federal student aid says what my mom made last year the government wont give me aid either
3048886 we are talking to families who are seeing really bad economic times investments no longer hold their value i expect we will see more unemployed parents
3048887 we are seeing students whose parents in the past have been able to get money from equity lines those sources are drying up and the cost of living and tuition has gone up and so that contributes to it
3048888 last year and the year before it was a lot easier to get money
3048889 we have awarded aid to more students and more students are seeing the need to take out loans
3048890 we had a number of students who have had the economic hard times of parents losing jobs or their assets what they can liquidate now is different than in january or february when they filed their forms
3048891 i wouldnt be surprised that if in the next couple weeks those that we havent heard from may decide not to come we are working very hard to prevent that
3048892 the education over there until the undergrad level is pretty good
3048893 but when it comes to grad school it just falls off the cliff in terms of quality
3048894 why should punjab get him we want to offer him even more
3048895 when someone gets some notoriety as sabeer did after selling hotmail they get bombarded with offers
3048896 if someone like sabeer is attached to a project then the thinking is other people will want to invest
3048897 but my reason for doing this is to leave behind a legacy
3048898 how many times in our lives do we get a chance to build a city
3048899 how many times do we get an opportunity to fix some of the problems that affect 1 1 billion people thats one sixth of humanity
3048900 the right partners do proper design provide basic things that you and i take for granted here

3048956 we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
3048957 we unreservedly apologize both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
3048958 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
3048959 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumors that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
3048960 until a few years ago there was no privacy law in this country and each case tried to stretch it a bit further
3048961 the mosley case was the one that stretched it that bit further still with the judge quite clear in his reasoning its forced editors to be more careful certainly in a case of this nature where its a very high profile royal

3048963 im looking forward to starting my army career and moving my family because theres not much opportunity here
3048964 my husband is a truck driver and can do his job anywhere so that works well for us
3048965 i see the army as the opportunity to get some excitement in my life
3048966 it will also give me some higher education and the opportunity to travel and see places i wouldnt normally be able to see im a little scared about leaving home because my mom and i are so close and ive never been away from her before but itll be ok
3048967 i am so proud of alyssa enlisting i think all young people should venture into the military as soon as they graduate because i think itll help them in the long run
3048968 it worries me about my daughter and iraq but she could get killed in a car accident right out here on the road so theres danger everywhere i know at least shes strong and now shes going to be army strong i know she can handle it i know shell be fine
3048969 show them how strong ive made you and always be good in everything you do if youre going to be a soldier be the best
3048970 we were second to last going into the last day but then i let my running skills take over
3048971 i got on the biathlon team then i got on the triathlon team then i got an e mail about this event here in istanbul which i didnt know anything about
3048972 ive seen so much culture and interacting with all the different services that are here this week im taking away a greater world view
3048973 you see so many different things you look at your pond and you only see your pond now the ocean gets bigger
3048974 i see the cior program as a perfect compliment to national guard sports and it closely matches the mission and value of the biathlon program
3048975 the way i like to describe the f model is like getting in a brand new car its clean doesnt have any dirt on it got new tires and got a nice shine to it
3048976 i think its a really nice airplane its definitely got some improved capabilities over the d model
3048977 you definitely have a better capability to be aware of whats going on around you with new radios moving maps integrated in the cockpit and the new maintenance panel
3048978 i am the first person thats going to have a meaningful impact on the life of this airframe everything i do right will show if i were to do anything wrong everything that i do wrong will be inherited by everyone else
3048979 its almost like an empowerment you are charged with the responsibility of making sure that this airplane gets off on a good foot that has a real big impact on me
3048980 the main differences are in the cockpit and obviously in the frame its got a lot of new features that are mainly for the pilots but anything that makes the pilots flight easier makes our job a little easier too
3048981 in the cockpit you had all these old analogue gauges where the needles would bounce around and made it very difficult to determine what was actually going on with the aircraft
3048982 weve gone from those bouncy little analogue gauges which were questionable in their reliability to five multi functional displays its pretty much like having five lcd televisions in your aircraft telling you exactly whats going on at any given time
3048983 its coming to the point where gone are the days where we had to sit with our maps and measure the distances and do time distance headings the aircraft will do it all for us
3048984 hsdh is basically a hover reference and it will tell us exactly where the aircraft is drifting and what we need to do as pilots to correct it so essentially we dont need any ground reference at all to land the aircraft under zero visibility
3048985 in the d model there were a lot of independently riveted parts and pieces whereas now we have a lot of solid sheets of aluminum which stiffen the aircraft greatly and allow for a smoother ride
3048986 weve run into a situation where a lot of the younger guys that dont have a lot of previous experience in d models are actually picking up these skills and putting them into practice sooner than guys who have 800 1000 2000 hours in the d model
3048987 the younger pilots are coming from a generation where game system controllers have 16 different buttons and theyre used to that sort of software
3048988 its really turning into a video game and its all a matter of who knows what buttons to push and who can push them faster
3048989 this has been an honor to work with the civil affairs community the department of state
3048990 honestly i have a huge debt of gratitude from the amazing experiences that ive grown from as a person and a leader
3048991 she has joined our economic team as a full fledged participant at her own initiative
3048992 peters proactive management and coordination of military movements and contacts with iraqi officials her development of close personal relationships with the provincial governor deputy governor and the influential sheiks her intellectual skills and intellectual courage demonstrated in iraq are indicative of the talented men and women who serve abroad as trained civil affairs operators in support of interagency cooperation and of u s national objectives abroad
3048993 this award is very significant for capt peters and our community
3048994 its not every day the department of state goes through such a significant level of work and documentation to recognize someone outside of their own community capt peters is a shining example of what ca is all about thanks to young soldiers officers and noncommissioned officers we have excellent reputation not only with the rest of the military but the interagency community which is very significant because the kind of work we have to do every day is very heavily dependent upon interagency cooperation congratulations captain peters
3048995 it was a bit of a culture shock returning from germany
3048996 the installation enjoys a close relationship with hinesville liberty county

3049002 at your next to last job how would you say you responded when you felt youd done something really well but you wound up being put on notice because your supervisor had a thing about surnames beginning with letters other than b g l p and t
3049003 hey no problem at all dawn by virtue of her being my supervisor i took as a given that her judgment was superior to my own and welcomed the opportunity to try to demonstrate that those of us with m names can with proper supervision occasionally make a contribution albeit a tiny one and hey have a great day
3049004 well i wasnt when i arrived but half an hour of your colleagues inane questions has certainly made me one
3049005 its a well perhaps over developed sense of self something to do with moving overseas and spelling his name differently there than here due to language conventions and then realizing he wanted to change it back when he came back to the states its kind of obnoxious
3049006 yeah its kind of obnoxious in the same sense that filling the hindenburg with hydrogen was kind of a bad idea
3049007 the fact he felt compelled to change it due to language conventions is almost as pretentious as the affectation itself somebody needs to smack this jackass

3049031 ive received unofficial reports that it has become rampant at all levels and it is frightening if this becomes normal practice in future it is sad if one day the people see this problem as synonymous with umno the situation must be corrected before the next general election
3049032 the advance i believe we have achieved in our discussions today is for us both to agree to the principle of a free trade agreement
3049033 i am confident in this market australias beef industry will continue to get a fair go
3049034 as a nation we should then be tracking attainment knowing that we are in the powerful position of comparing like schools with like schools
3049035 if two schools have comparable school populations but widely varying results we would be able to ask the question why and ascertain the answer
3049036 this is absolutely the direction that we need to go
3049037 we already provide some performance information to parents in south australia and there may be scope to expand on this if it is not used to create misleading league tables
3049038 to be sure each of these three sectors government civil society and the business sector can accomplish important things on its own

3049040 weve got to get off java because the printer driver is just no good
3049041 what exactly are you trying to do lets have a chat about the situation
3049042 we got to get off java we will just try and work it out
3049043 well maybe there is another way of doing it that wont require printer drivers
3049044 oh we can we can just take the system as it is and make it available as a service
3049045 if we need to change how do we best do best do that
3049046 all you have to do is a single definition of what your data looks like in a very simple way and then we can expose that to the rest of the world through multiple formats
3049047 lets understand is this behind the firewall what are the levels of protection that are required
3049048 do we have an api how do we build an api where do we get an api so that people can syndicate the information that we have
3049049 its my data i dont just want to host things in an open fashion i dont want to write code in an open fashion i want open services and open data so i can get it move it protect it myself and relocate it
3049050 absent exigent circumstances not present here so called no knock raids are an affront to the constitution so is a shoot first ask questions later philosophy by the police yet the prince georges police have done this before last fall they invaded a house at the wrong address and shot the family dog all americans are at risk when the police behave this way just ask yourself what might happen if a suspicious package is delivered to your home and the cops bust in
3049051 but there is an even larger point law enforcement agencies have become more arrogant and less accountable in cases other than those involving drugs most people are aware of well publicized examples like waco and ruby ridge but similar abuses are common across the country though they usually receive little or no public notice we all want police to do their jobs well but part of doing their job well is respecting the peoples constitutional liberties
3049052 when he told us he quit his job i said what do you mean you quit your full time job with benefits and dont know what you are going to do after the trip
3049053 he said this is a good time in my life to do it
3049054 so far weve raised 1 800 so we will be able to award at least three 500 scholarships next spring
3049055 they hope to be able to award five 500 scholarships
3049056 one hundred percent of the money they raise will go for the scholarships they are paying all the administrative fees and trip expenses out of their own pockets
3049057 the oregon coastline was amazing we have been breezing through towns and have had a lot of tourists and locals asking us a lot of questions about what were doing
3049058 its always fun to talk to them about our trip we are trying to shed some of our gear and purge some weight since we will be biking into a headwind and have several miles of hills to do so every ounce counts
3049059 truth i dont im not a lady who lunches its a lull in the day

3049061 we will do what we did in the past we fought with positive results whenever we find them we will arrest them and bring them to justice
3049062 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence this was a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3049063 it is the view of local law enforcement and u s authorities that this was not premeditated not targeted not specific
3049064 it was not a drawn out event i think it happened quite quickly and i dont think there was anything said
3049065 anger is not an emotion im allowing myself to indulge in
3049066 the terrorists were two women one was injured one was killed
3049067 it is still under investigation whether it was connected with other organisations
3049068 the terrorists that were killed and arrested were all uighurs and from xinjiang
3049069 i was shocked by the increase in young new voters
3049070 the majority of hispanics come from a humble background and may feel that obama can relate to them more
3049071 i think people are beginning to understand what they need to have when they register
3049072 for many of these people its not easy to get identification
3049073 they marched under the banner of today we march tomorrow we vote
3049074 there is a massive effort under way to register illegal aliens in the country
3049075 we are building electoral power for our community so they can have a say not only on the streets but at the ballot box
3049076 once we have a strong vote i think politicians will think twice before they pass all these anti immigrant bills
3049077 the typical voter is someone who owns a house is highly educated is financially stable and over 40 and in our community you arent going to find that
3049078 elected officials are going to see there is power in our community that immigrants are part of their constituency
3049079 the laws are getting so strict against us that im trying to protect myself and my family
3049080 i want the right to vote so that i can help my people
3049081 the mass sea of illegal aliens bearing foreign flags and hostile placards really produced a pronounced backlash from which theyve never recovered
3049082 they say we demonstrated we came out by the millions but what did we change
3049083 marches can get peoples attention but it doesnt necessarily get a higher percentage of the community involved in civic participation thats what things like get out the vote and voter registration drives do
3049084 this is one of many issues and its going to take time but it will come
3049085 i think people still have it in their hearts and still want to fight for what they believe in
3049086 but it will require sustained investment and a lot of hard work

3049112 also im pretty sure every place around here is haunted
3049113 thats just because everything here is built on the mass graves of dissidents and homeless people
3049114 what in the world is this i bet its some sort of chinese death threat
3049115 if youre so worried that the chinese led us here just to kill us all why dont you ask them about it
3049116 i did they told me that if theyre planning to kill us all that their internal affairs and no concerns of ours
3049117 i dont trust the chinese if you see any chinese around me you kill them
3049118 why cant you hussies keep it in the blue line
3049119 i should have known the russians were going to be warmongering from all the tom clancy videogames ive played
3049120 according to those how do things turn out in the end
3049121 i bet i know how the chinese are going to kill us its the air theyve poisoned the air and a couple weeks of breathing it will cause us to drop dead soon after we get back

3049135 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3049136 i remember when comedians in advance of his performance were booed off and the first thing that came out of his mouth as soon as he looked at the audience was im not scared of you mother s
3049137 he coined that phrase then and it became one of his top calling cards for his whole life
3049138 there were still moments when we thought he might say the wrong thing but there were still moments when we were on the edge of our seat not knowing what he was going to say next
3049139 everyone who knew him was touched by him he was generous
3049140 he had a very very very beautiful spirit he seemed very connected
3049141 for that were all going to miss him even more than his comedy
3049142 he was an individual there were many people who followed him who were inspired by him and borrowed his style and attitude

3049148 endspiel gegen deutschland wer verliert kann gleich nach hause gehen
3049149 die aufregung spannung und ungewissheit im vorfeld war einfach verr ckt
3049150 ich bin irgendwie froh dass dieses spiel vorbei ist das drumherum war einfach zu viel
3049151 er kam zu uns und sagte ich unterst tze euch die nation unterst tzt euch also geht raus und tretet in ein paar hintern
3049152 es war schwer f r uns konditionell und physisch sind die usa uns berlegen
3049153 dieses spiel hat uns trotzdem sehr geholfen meine jungs konnten eine menge lernen
3049154 da bin ich mir ganz sicher wenn wir den weg gemeinsam beschlie en und ein parteitag die zustimmung gibt werden alle abgeordneten bis auf frau dagmar metzger die ihre meinung auch nicht ndert meinen weg mit unterst tzen
3049155 ich bin keine basta politikerin sondern ich frage schon auch die partei welchen weg sie mit mir gehen will ich m chte eine m glichst breite beteiligung auch derer die wahlkampf gemacht haben wie es denn weitergehen soll und da bieten sich regionalkonferenzen an
3049156 das ist zun chst erstmal eine entscheidung der hessischen freundinnen und freunde
3049157 wir sind bereit beratend und mit berlegungen zur seite zu stehen alles andere was an ffentlichen ratschl gen gegeben wird ist nicht ganz hilfreich
3049158 wir sind hier nicht in einer parallelwelt wir sind teil der gesamt spd
3049159 es waren nur meine mutter und mein bester freund florian orterer dabei ich bin total berw ltigt
3049160 einer steht f r boris und einer f r mich

3049162 tja wo die liebe hinf llt so ndern sich die zeiten

3049169 wir hoffen auf eine schnelle investorl sung um die filialen zu erhalten und um die menschen dort weiterzubesch ftigen
3049170 das kann auf eine bundesweite investorl sung f r alle hertie filialen hinauslaufen oder aber auch auf eine rein hamburger l sung
3049171 die aktienquote ist bei mir voll flexibel zwischen 0 und 100 prozent ist alles m glich
3049172 die reine aktienquote ist aktuell mit gerade einmal 38 prozent sehr niedrig
3049173 damit ist die gesetzliche vorschrift erf llt dass 50 prozent investiert sein m ssen
3049174 knapp 93 prozent des fondsverm gens sind derzeit investiert 88 prozent in aktien und f nf prozent in derivate deren wert von aktien abh ngt die restlichen sieben prozent sind kassenbestand
3049175 wir halten in diesem fonds weniger als ein prozent des verm gens als bargeld
3049176 wir halten aktuell zwei optionspositionen im fonds aber deren anteil am fondsverm gen ist verschwindend gering
3049177 aktienfondsmanager sollten aktien ausw hlen und die entscheidung des kunden in aktien zu investieren bestm glich umsetzen

3049180 es wird zunehmend ein streit sichtbar nach dem motto welche polizei bilden wir aus
3049181 davon halten wir nichts wir sind eine zivile polizei die sich an gesetzen orientiert und nicht im b rgerkrieg t tig ist das ist bei paramilit rischen einheiten anders wir k nnen nicht die verantwortung f r etwas bernehmen was wir nicht wollen
3049182 nicht eingetroffen alle haben immer zusagen gemacht und in wirklichkeit tat sich gar nichts
3049183 wir haben immer wert gelegt auf eine klassische polizeiausbildung und nicht auf eine paramilit rische
3049184 die europ er m ssen erstmal zu einer einheitlichen linie finden sie haben unterschiedliche polizeitraditionen unterschiedliche aufgaben und ausr stungen und jeder glaubt dass seine vorstellung von polizeiarbeit jetzt nach afghanistan exportiert werden m sse
3049185 marja profitului a fost de 5 iar pentru intreg anul 2008 estimam o crestere de 20 a volumului afacerilor comparativ cu anul trecut
3049186 nu ar avea sens sa inchiriezi in alta parte a lumii
3049187 am ales aceasta afacere deoarece domeniul de prestari servicii este unul in care nu poti da faliment in romania
3049188 ne am strans mai multi oameni cu experienta in domeniul postei transporturilor si curieratului am pus bani impreuna si am cumparat cateva masini cu care am inceput livrarea in romania

3049192 it was a tremendous effort on his part to stay in the best conditioning through this

3049197 ive had my eye on ben curtis for a long time and i really believe he is going to add a lot to this team
3049198 i like the fact he won the british open and came back after having a down spell in his career and won those two tournaments in that one year i saw a lot of heart in ben curtis
3049199 ben has got that kind of demeanor we need on the ryder cup team
3049200 hes a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality
3049201 hes the type of guy thats going to just put his head down and barrel on
3049202 tonight was tinas night but the crowd was cheering so hard every now and then we had to check the score then we went yeah were still up by 30

3049205 many clinton supporters are already resentful of obama whom they see as having only won the nomination with the support of a sexist media and democratic establishment

3049225 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3049226 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3049227 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3049228 as we continue avis transformation from an antisense pioneer into an rna based drug discovery and development company we are excited to report on our recent progress and ongoing activities toward achieving both our short term and long term goals
3049229 over the past twelve months we have significantly enriched the pharmaceutical utility of our core phosphorodiamidate morpholino pmo technology through the addition of several new derivative chemistries that could improve the bioavailability potency and therapeutic index of the original chemical series overall our antisense based chemistries significantly expand the field of rna based therapeutics by not only competitively inhibiting mrna translation but by also directing the processing of pre mrna to provide potential therapeutic benefit in an important range of diseases we believe these unique capabilities which are not encompassed by the technology portfolio and intellectual property estate of our competitors position avi to secure a leading role in the future successes of rna based drug development
3049230 we have just begun to feel the impact of our newly acquired intellectual property the recent advances in our core chemistry the new product focus brought to our pipeline the additions to our leadership team and the fiscal measures employed to extend our current financial runway we believe that there are partnership opportunities for a company that can go beyond simple inhibition of mrna we believe we are such a company but we now have to demonstrate this to capture the full value from our technology and intellectual property with the ongoing and increasing interest in rna based therapeutics by both the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors we believe our renewed activity and focus on business development coupled with our preclinical and clinical advances are happening at an opportune time

3049242 we want to get the word out that downtown parker is still open for business
3049243 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3049244 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3049245 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3049246 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3049247 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3049264 the people assigned to us from the hotel have been wonderful
3049265 what were all trying to do is push the limits of what we know
3049266 there are always people who are trying to integrate what is strange and unusual into the mainstream and so they are seen as strange and unusual but what theyre doing today might be accepted as fact years from now
3049267 most of these tools you see pendulums and dowsing rods are to detect subtle physical movement the conscious mind cant detect
3049268 you use dowsing to ask questions throughout the process and dowsing shows what each flowers gift is

3049282 the g7 ministers called on russia to accept an immediate ceasefire they expressed deep concern for the civilian casualties and continued attacks on civilian locations
3049283 they reaffirmed support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and called on russia to respect these
3049284 i was very firm with vladimir putin i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3049285 he is seriously concerned about the disproportionate use of force by the russians and the lack of respect for the territorial integrity of georgia
3049286 the military operations that we saw on saturday and since then including air and missile attacks have no relation to and go well beyond the cis peacekeeping operation
3049287 the last couple of months i dont think theres been a better player in baseball
3049288 not just offensively but even defensively he has played outstanding

3049321 di tim juventus giovinco pantas mendapat nomor 10 di masa datang dia pantas menjadi bintang yang akan mengikuti langkah para bintang seperti michel platini roberto baggio zinedine zidane dan alessandro del piero
3049322 saya sudah melihat permainannya di olimpiade dan dia memang sulit dihentikan semua lawan takut kepadanya itu artinya dia memang bintang yang kuat dan tanda yang hebat
3049323 giovinco memiliki kualitas untuk mengenakan kostum bernomor 10 di juventus karena permainannya memang seperti para pendahulu yang pernah memakai nomor itu saya benar benar berharap dia akan dipanggil pelatih timnas italia marcello lippi begitu pulang dari olimpiade lippi seharusnya sudah berani memasukkannya di timnas senior
3049324 kalau saat munggah atau lebaran pasti banyak pedagang musiman yang jual bunga tabur di sini tapi kalau hari biasa cuma saya seorang yang jualan bunga tabur di sekitaran tmpn kalibata
3049325 sebab pengalaman saya tahun tahun sebelumnya jumlah peziarah pada hari kemerdekaan tidak berbeda dengan hari biasa dengan begitu pemasukan didapatkan juga tidak berbeda dengan hari biasanya
3049326 karena tidak semua pengunjung membeli bunga tabur di sini ada yang bawa bunga tabur dari rumah ada juga yang ziarah tanpa memakai bunga tabur
3049327 kalau hari minggu bisa dapat sampai 100 ribu rupiah dibandingkan hari biasa atau hari kemerdekaan pada hari minggu tmpn kalibata lebih banyak dikunjungi para peziarah
3049328 pada hari biasa rata rata jumlah peziarah yang berkunjung ke tmpn kalibata sekitar 20 pengunjung tapi hari minggu jumlah peziarah bisa meningkat tiga sampai empat kali lipat
3049329 selain itu saya juga jual air mawar yang perbotolnya dijual empat ribu rupiah kalau keranjang bunga cukup saya pinjamkan saja kepada pembeli itung itung bonus beli bunga tabur di sini
3049330 yaitu saat munggah dan di saat hari raya idul fitri karena pada saat itu tmpn kalibata banyak dikunjungi peziarah dibandingkan dengan hari hari lainnya bisa dibilang panen rejeki

3049333 our judges felt like if a company like aquamantra can take something as simple and as healthy as water and turn it into something much more powerful without adding a bunch of junk they are certainly worthy of our top award

3049368 de show heeft zichzelf al bewezen in nederland en heeft internationale potentie daarom is het een welkome toevoeging aan onze catalogus het zal tijdens mipcom in oktober prominent in de etalage gezet worden
3049369 this is a lot of hype over something so trivial
3049370 but really it is not trivial it is just one of the many word games that we women play with each other on a regular basis and the sad thing is that it becomes so natural to respond in these ways that we do not even realize the offense or damage that our words can inflict
3049371 i simply do not possess the time management skills and discipline that you have my friend
3049372 wenn wir programme starten kommen wir um mindestens einen der gro en player zanox oder affilinet nicht herum man kann dann noch ein kleineres netzwerk wie webgains oder superclix als erg nzung hinzunehmen
3049373 die haben halt auch noch die zeit sich zu k mmern
3049374 china at least certainly leads the world in something the capacity to hide the dirt with glitter and gold
3049375 funny how we have all these conveniences to make our lives easier but we still cant find time to do things like learn to be self sufficient
3049376 a life full of promise and potential has been lost to us both as a community and as a people
3049377 some elements with very clear motives and intentions use these lawsuits as a weapon against israel
3049378 we believe that these individuals are criminals and that they have committed horrible crimes against humanity a one ton bomb was thrown at a civilian neighborhood in gaza and 15 people died there

3049385 if you cant beat the insurgents militarily well cut off their transportation and starve them out
3049386 what our study shows is that artificially inflating a childs mood may make it harder for them to pay attention to details which could be important in school contexts
3049387 forceful argument and even the power to make decisions do not at all address questions related to the process of implementation
3049388 the fallacy of rationalism is the assumption that the social world can be altered by seemingly logical argument
3049389 we would like to see san diego become a foreclosure sanctuary
3049390 design and education excellence for schools as centers of community
3049391 the economy has been going downhill and with gas prices and food prices going up just the cost of living is going up many low income families cannot afford to have their children not get that lunch
3049392 its important to provide this service to the community especially in this economy

3049400 die erh hung der familienbeihilfe kann nicht warten gerade familien und j ngere menschen sind von der teuerung stark betroffen sie brauchen jetzt eine entlastung
3049401 wichtig in diesem zusammenhang ist es aber zeitgleich eine nderung des studienf rderungsgesetzes vorzunehmen damit es durch das bestreben gerade auch studierende durch die erh hung der familienbeihilfe zu unterst tzen nicht aus unachtsamkeit zu einer verschlechterung f r die studierenden kommt
3049402 durch die familienbeihilfeerh hung darf es nicht zu einer finanziellen verschlechterung f r studierenden kommen einer nderung des studienf rderungsgesetztes steht allerdings nichts im wege
3049403 nach der erh hung der familienbeihilfe f r kinder ab sechs jahren muss allerdings in einem zweiten schritt die familienbeihilfe f r kinder unter sechs jahren auch erh ht werden
3049404 mit alfred sinowatz verliert sterreich einen bedeutenden politiker der nachkriegsgeneration sinowatz steht f r bedeutende schulreformen und hat gerade im bildungsbereich viel f r die chancengleichheit von sterreichs kindern umgesetzt

3049406 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
3049407 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for
3049408 aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
3049409 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
3049410 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
3049411 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
3049412 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
3049413 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her
3049414 but i got a bronze yesterday and a silver this morning if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
3049415 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
3049416 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
3049417 thats a hell of a swim and he is a true champion
3049418 when hayley mcgregory broke her world record in the prelims at the u s trials coughlin came back in the very next heat to take it back
3049419 natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning
3049420 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final
3049421 new book out and making the move to open access
3049422 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
3049423 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
3049424 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
3049425 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3049426 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3049427 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
3049428 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
3049429 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
3049430 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
3049431 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
3049432 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
3049433 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
3049434 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
3049435 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
3049436 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
3049437 i will simply say its by far the most impressive thing i saw at e3
3049438 sony ninjas will hit me with poison shurikens before i can type the words to describe it
3049439 we are looking at the files they are 20 or 23 of the former state governors i believe that in the next two weeks we will know which of them are to be investigated or not some of them are already being prosecuted for money laundering money laundering is not in our mandate
3049440 we are scrutinising the file to see whether there are cases that we could now pursue many of these allegations were committed as far back as 2003 we need to see which of these allegations are motivated for election purposes
3049441 for this category of people we dont need an independent counsel
3049442 the chief justice will study the allegations and consider whether it is worthwhile to appoint independent counsel to investigate those allegations when the independent counsel investigates he does not prosecute he reports to the legislature it is for the legislature to take over from there
3049443 as far as we are concerned nobody should feel offended if investigated it is what the laws say that we will do it is misconception to look at the status of a person and conclude that you are not going to investigate him

3049452 the church after gods heart seeks the soul one by one

3049457 ein weiterer erfolg ist die erh hung der f rderung bei der 24 stunden betreuung bei der selbstst ndigen betreuung auf 550 euro und auf 1 100 bei der unselbstst ndigen betreuung die verm gensgrenze entf llt zudem diese verbesserungen greifen bereits ab 1 november dieses jahres damit werden die sozialversicherungsbeitr ge bei legalisierten betreuungsverh ltnissen zu 100 prozent abgedeckt
3049458 sometimes i wonder if i saw one of my old high school teachers what would i call them like would i call them mr or mrs whatever or by their first name
3049459 i think youd call them whatever you called them in high school i think thats normal
3049460 i mean if i saw one of my old coaches id definitely call them coach
3049461 one of my coaches coach jacobs was also my teacher
3049462 no his last name was jacobs and jake is a nickname for jacobs

3049465 industry margins can be sustained at more normalized levels of profitability should these or our other production cutbacks be reversed

3049472 jede investition in die ausbildung unserer kinder ist eine investition in die zukunft des landes
3049473 und auch als bundeskanzler hat fred sinowatz der seinem geliebten burgenland stets eng verbunden blieb nie seine wurzeln vergessen jene wurzeln die die sozialdemokratie bis heute stark machen n mlich der unbedingte glauben daran dass politik f r die menschen da sein muss
3049474 f r die sterreichische sozialdemokratie von unsch tzbarem und bleibendem wert ist mit der entwicklung moderner zukunftsweisender konzepte hat fred sinowatz wichtige grundlagen f r die wahlerfolge der sp in den sechziger und siebziger jahren geschaffen

3049483 as a follow up to our phone conversation the city was advised that pursuant to section 56758 of the government code lafco would be unable to process a sphere of influence amendment application simultaneously with this annexation application however that effective january 2 2009 the provision in state law which stipulates that cities with over 100 000 residents located in a county with a population of over 4 million may not submit an annexation application for an inhabited area unless that area is already within the citys sphere of influence would no longer be in effect therefore please withdraw the above referenced annexation application from further processing until after the first of the year at which time the city will resubmit its request

3049498 phil is a skeptic a scientist and a colleague and his ideas and vigor will take the jref very far indeed were pleased and proud to have him take the reins
3049499 i will now be dedicating much of my time to completing my next two books wrong and a magician in the laboratory
3049500 when i was young i believed in all sorts of antiscientific silliness like the bermuda triangle astral projection and the like but then i saw mr randi on television masterfully and literally dissecting psychic surgery con artists who fake using psychic powers to do phony surgery on desperately ill victims and he opened my eyes and my brain to the idea that reality is a better place to live in than fantasy i owe it all to mr randi so i am very excited and deeply honored to continue his vision with the jref
3049501 i want to teach kids about the wonders of the real universe we can do this by partnering with the educational community and developing fun hands on materials that schoolchildren can use in the classroom to teach them about critical thinking and the scientific method science is sometimes taught as being cold and dull but nothing could be more wrong its exciting its fun and its cool kids are natural scientists and we need to encourage that foster it and let it grow
3049502 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock

3049504 now hold on a minute lets think logically about this
3049505 the brain drain 10 years ago is actually helping the market today
3049506 these are the people going back today bringing domain expertise with them the opportunities in india have dramatically increased for them
3049507 no its been so long since weve had a date i think i would just rather sit and talk with you over a nice dinner
3049508 the concept of basing ones actions on an internally consistent framework of principles
3049509 because we didnt say we would if we would have said we would we would have been there
3049510 this is the confidence we have in approaching god that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us
3049511 dad is not quite finished with your sister so i guess i get to sleep on your bed for a few minutes until we switch

3049513 well when you are going to europe to be a designer for david yurman
3049514 unleashing the power of the laity by continually developing your faith
3049515 other states have schisms or disagreements and often serious ones between more fiscally oriented republicans and socially conservative ones by and large they have their fights but it doesnt effect the electoral politics all that much here it effects everything
3049516 you have this bitter battle often more bitter between the wings of the republican party than with the democrats
3049517 social conservatives can do better in primaries statewide but they cant win a general election
3049518 it ends up being very dysfunctional for the republican party
3049519 when a democrat gets elected statewide the republicans have to put them there
3049520 consequences in the state legislature because the governor is able not all the time but often to work with some moderate republicans
3049521 it influences elections it influences the parties and it influences state policy
3049522 the moderates were successfully able to paint kline as someone kansans werent comfortable with
3049523 the split is healing and is not near the level that it was
3049524 it really has hurt the and theres no end in sight
3049525 it is clear that russias current leadership is bent on restoring a neocolonial form of control over the entire space once governed by moscow
3049526 when this failed the kremlin turned its attention to south ossetia ordering its proxies there to escalate attacks on georgian positions
3049527 my government answered with a unilateral cease fire the separatists began attacking civilians and russian tanks pierced the georgian border we had no choice but to protect our civilians and restore our constitutional order
3049528 yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia
3049529 and above all it is a war over the kind of europe our children will live in let us be frank this conflict is about the future of freedom in europe
3049530 no country of the former soviet union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than georgia
3049531 worked hard to peacefully bring abkhazia and south ossetia back into the georgian fold on terms that would fully protect the rights and interests of the residents of these territories
3049532 while we appealed to residents of abkhazia and south ossetia with our vision of a common future moscow increasingly took control of the separatist regimes
3049533 the kremlin even appointed russian security officers to arm and administer the self styled separatist governments
3049534 if georgia falls this will also mean the fall of the west in the entire former soviet union and beyond
3049535 leaders in neighboring states whether in ukraine in other caucasian states or in central asia will have to consider whether the price of freedom and independence is indeed too high
3049536 every company is looking to be a part of the conversation
3049537 we need to do a lot more work in these areas to have the models to move forward
3049538 weve got to move forward because weve got to change the odds of this game
3049539 i will simply say its by far the most impressive thing i saw at e3

3049552 i think the rain this last day and a half helped
3049553 you could really feel it in your lungs when you started to breathe heavily
3049554 i did not think it was going to be like that i have yet to see blue sky or sun i thought maybe there was going to be a small smog layer in patches but its literally a haze he said
3049555 weve managed to adapt to the situation from home to china said siboniso cele of south africa who is competing in slalom canoe
3049556 there is some pollution but for me everything about the environment i just take it out i dont want an excuse i cant control the environment and the pollution i havent tried any different things like a mask because in the race you have to do the race without the mask
3049557 both teams were breathing the same air we were more concerned with the heat and humidity he said

3049560 if i dont go now ill miss out on being one of the first people to discover a once in a life time event ill only be gone for three days ill be back before you know it
3049561 son ill be back soon in the meantime you look after your mother

3049564 thats great we should get going i brought my camera with me how about you
3049565 ive been good but even better now after the new discovery weve recently dug up
3049566 accumulating evidence of a slowing in domestic demand and activity
3049567 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are likely to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
3049568 the words are more worried than their growth forecasts but the bank is in no hurry to be super aggressive
3049569 a significant moderation in spending and activity is under way
3049570 we are entirely comfortable that the bank intends to cut rates in september
3049571 the reserve bank is tip toeing rather than striding down the path of rate cuts
3049572 but the timing and size of any rate move is dependent on economic data to be released over the next few weeks a decision on a september rate cut could actually be left until the eleventh hour given that figures on retail spending and building approvals are both released on the day of the next board meeting
3049573 the european union is slipping into a recession that may prove to eventually be even worse than that in america
3049574 hi mom or did strange things like pretending to pull an imaginary rope
3049575 china at least certainly leads the world in something the capacity to hide the dirt with glitter and gold
3049576 we erected barricades at several places on the srinagar muzaffarabad road
3049577 we have suffered a loss of at least 20 million rupees about 475 000 since this agitation began
3049578 and if the blockade continues it will be a disaster for us
3049579 im not going to screw up dating a smokin hot famous chick whos 9 years older than me by talking about babies
3049580 while current conditions have challenged our wholesale businesses we have been able to leverage the strength of our retail franchise to
3049581 there was no specific guidance going forward and that is a point for caution
3049582 the composition of the result was ok and there were no negative surprises that derailed the bottom line
3049583 the bendigo bank retail network continues to expand by around 25 branches each year and with a high proportion of branches yet to reach maturity future income growth is to some extent locked in
3049584 we are also taking the opportunity afforded by the current disruption to wholesale markets to reshape those businesses for growth and improved margins once funding begins to flow again
3049585 i fought really hard in the semi final and just missed out in a very little thing but thats part of the sport
3049586 the risks associated with stilnox and other hypnotics generally outweigh any benefits they provide with continuous long term use
3049587 there is no convincing evidence that the benefit harm profile of zolpidem or zopiclone is more favourable than that of short acting benzodiazepines such as temazepam
3049588 tolerance dependence withdrawal symptoms and morning sedation have also been reported with zolpidem and zopiclone
3049589 the difficulty with any pill not just stilnox is that the risk of dependency is related to the fact that stopping them abruptly can lead to rebound sleep problems meaning the sleep can be worse than it was in the first place because your body has got used to the pill
3049590 let me say clearly that i am not progressing that recommendation at this stage
3049591 that matter is not a priority for me but it is something that i will speak to my colleagues about
3049592 our main concern about privacy is not the idea of it itself but the red tape it imposes over the businesses its just more for the businesses to cope with
3049593 open new fields for australias burgeoning cohort of class action lawyers
3049594 every time we see a problem that doesnt mean that we should regulate or legislate
3049595 to do so may simply bog down businesses and individuals with unnecessary strictures and red tape
3049596 in areas of complexity particularly where there are a number of competing and justifiably competing views and social demands it is important to reflect a considered approach
3049597 this provocation was aimed at occupying south ossetia abkhazia and then all of georgia
3049598 hitachi continues to improve upon and deliver cutting edge and innovative products and is pleased to offer the latest upgrades in camcorder technology to its customers and consumers

3049606 when we seek death we often seek to achieve a symbolic immortality and becoming a presidential wife could have been that for her
3049607 elizabeth edwards drank her husbands kool aid and became his ambition enabler
3049608 the launch of best buy express is another way for best buy to provide consumers with the products they need from a brand they trust even while theyre on the go
3049609 whether travelers are looking to purchase a last minute gift or are in need of replacement for a lost forgotten or broken product these kiosks will allow them to purchase the product they want from a brand they trust
3049610 certainly i do living in the country on top of a mountain everywhere i go i see pastures with cows horses and goats as well as an alpaca farm and i look at them and want to paint them in fact most of my paintings end up looking like a landscape with a horizon no matter how abstract i guess its just my personality its whats in me
3049611 sometimes the painting looks like i think it will and other times i just have to follow what it wants to do
3049612 they had to work within the piece as a whole
3049613 to just copy what something looks like is more of a technical ability
3049614 although those works at times can be very emotional i personally find that it is more difficult to paint something you dont actually see and i never get bored with it i dont know what to expect and when a painting starts working theres always a sense of satisfaction
3049615 the main reason to paint is to learn about yourself and to grow if you get in a rut pull out colors you dont normally use and play around with shapes and colors anything that interests you has potential
3049616 i was expecting the new york art world to accept me on my terms
3049617 looking back i realize i was making paintings more for myself and not for people to enjoy everything changed when i moved to mexico and found a way of engaging the hospitable people who welcomed me by giving myself the freedom to paint expressively and focusing my attention on creating pictures that would bring joy to others a new world of possibilities opened up
3049618 im interested in setting up color vibrations and making the combination of pigments pop
3049619 i use colors that respond to the personality of the subjects and i strive for unexpected color combinations that in the end really do capture the texture form and appearance of the individuals face
3049620 i want to give credit to my artist friend joseph marioni for introducing me to guerra paints and pigments and for helping me realize the benefit of working with bright pure high quality pigments
3049621 joseph is a modernist painter whose strength is his use of color and although my paintings are representational they are also about the connections between pigments perceptions and personalities
3049622 whether im painting a tribesman in papua new guinea or american children whose parents hired me to create a portrait there is always a metaphysical dynamic and a connection between me and the sitters
3049623 i spend time getting to know the person so that the portrait results from a spiritual connection between us and so viewers can sense the emotions we exchanged i want the paintings to become stories of the lives of the subjects and the powerful transference that happens through the creative process
3049624 because i frequently move from country to country and work in school rooms private homes small apartments and public buildings it isnt possible to use solvents such as turpentine mineral spirits or linseed oil
3049625 furthermore i have to be able to roll up the large canvases the day after they are finished and carry them in a van or on a plane oil just doesnt dry fast enough for that
3049626 i call myself an arm painter not a wrist painter
3049627 that is i am most comfortable when i can move a brush with the full motion of my arm and not just my fingers but more important the large scale of the paintings is appropriate for capturing the life force i feel when i meet someone listen to the story of his or her life and become captivated by the face that expresses what ive come to appreciate about the person its ironic i suppose that to me the portraits are more lifelike when the faces are 10 times life size ill work smaller on commissioned portraits that are intended for private homes but i prefer to work on larger canvases when the portraits will be displayed in public spaces
3049628 im a tall guy so my outstretched arms can grasp a 64 inch wide stretched canvas and i can maneuver it into a freight elevator anything larger and i either have to paint it where it will be hung or transport it unstretched and then restretch it when i put it on display
3049629 like every other artist i faced the challenge of trying to make people aware of what i was doing in order to generate sales and commissions
3049630 fortunately when 30 000 people make an effort to see an art exhibition the paintings catch the attention of the news media and the general public that helps build positive recognition for me and prompts sales and commissions and although im happy to work with commercial galleries many of the countries in which i work simply dont have active gallery markets thats why i sometimes organize my own exhibitions in public places
3049631 through the organization i have facilitated art workshops for thousands of children
3049632 the organization mounts exhibits of portrait paintings of children artists and local craftspeople ultimately faces of the world serves to preserve and celebrate indigenous culture by promoting education cultural pride ethno ecotourism and art
3049633 we are delighted to commence work on the new campus the state government has worked at enhancing infrastructure facilities at hyderabad to make it a premier it destination globally
3049634 number of worthy people who are being considered some i will name and others i will not prof abubakar alhasan prof agyeman badu akosah dr kwaku osafo dr abu sakara and dr kwabena dufour former governor of the central bank there are also three women who are being looked at because they are not obviously in the political scene now
3049635 the cpp is a national party that will choose a running mate informed by the dictates of ethnicity tribe or religion no not at all the main criteria is somebody who can be president in his or her own right we have always been a national party we have broadly and widely appealed to ghanaians all over so we do not have religious or ethnic considerations in any of this
3049636 once the cpp comes up with a decision that person will be well liked that person will be somebody that we ourselves will feel comfortable with therefore that person will be very very competitive as far as the other people in the race are concerned
3049637 that i cannot say the names are there they are being reviewed and at the right time the team will come out with some finalist who will then be interviewed and then the choice will be made
3049638 those are the things i am going to concentrate on
3049639 we only had a consideration for the pnc for an alliance the pnc after agreeing and indeed after dr mahama agreeing to be my running mate went back and decided that they want to reconsider it they have said that they would like to talk again i have not heard from them we have always believed that this is the time for the cpp to become stronger competitive and to win that is what we are concentrating on i believe that in time all who belong to the cpp will find their way back to the party
3049640 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market
3049641 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3049642 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3049643 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3049644 die bewertung einer unternehmerischen leistung darf nicht in politisches ermessen gelegt werden sie geh rt in die h nde der eigent mer und kann dem markt nicht entzogen werden
3049645 vielmehr bedarf es dringend einer professionalisierung der aufsichtsr te um eine effektive kontrolle und leistungsgerechte gehaltsfindung zu gew hrleisten
3049646 unternehmerischer misserfolg hingegen darf nicht l nger mit hohen abfindungen honoriert werden nur wer leistung erbringt kann anspruch auf eine entsprechende verg tung erheben
3049647 if vodafone itself admits that it is standard practice then it stands to reason that the same practice applied to gt and we will like to know the people who are playing that role for vodafone and what they are getting out of it it is based on vodafones own admission
3049648 given the lack of transparency that has characterized this whole transaction is it not surprising that a company with a history of shady shadowy of corrupt officials is being given 70 shares in a state owned company
3049649 the company is not performing our financial position is not the best quality of service in terms of mobile coverage is also not the best and we call on government to go ahead with the intended sale
3049650 i want them to enjoy the thrill of painting for a day
3049651 through the years ive been to lots of demos and a couple of them made me very sleepy
3049652 i decided that if i were ever going to give demonstrations they were going to be engaging and so in demos i ask questions share stories and explain everything that im doing right down to what colors i am using for a particular mixture its performance in a sense and i want it to be exciting for people i want to make them excited to paint
3049653 what you paint isnt as important as how you paint it
3049654 but you need some sort of reference it helps to have something in front of you
3049655 this workshop is about what you are going to do with the paint we are going to push paint around
3049656 if you draw something intricate you will be tempted to just fill in the drawing with the paint and that will keep you from being free and loose
3049657 look you are going to be using a lot of paint today
3049658 if you see another cool red that you think you want to try for example go for it as long as you have the basic primary colors you will be ok
3049659 if you start with really thick paint you have nowhere to go
3049660 just get the big broad shapes first it doesnt matter if the paint goes outside of the forms edge
3049661 i can do a flower with this brush in two strokes
3049662 this is my chance to go in with the background color and chisel around the shapes work the edges so some of them blend into one another or into the background
3049663 build up and use more paint as you go along you can always go back in later and clean up shapes
3049664 when you are looking at the still life dont take it so literally
3049665 manipulate things use the other end of your brush and scratch in a line use your finger change the color of something do whats best for the painting the painting is more important than what you are looking at
3049666 then you are writing thats detail hold it like a tennis make direct bolder marks
3049667 i think thats a real attraction for some of them
3049668 i take some of each color and mix it just a little bit so both colors are on the brush so there are pieces of color and half mixed paint on there
3049669 you can really beat a color to death if you overmix it this way the colors blend on the canvas and make a more exciting mixture
3049670 i like to get them to figure it out on their own
3049671 i feel like thats more valuable i will give them specific answers if im asked but allowing students to determine what is wrong with a painting and how to fix it allows their artistic vision to emerge they all know more than they think they know i just advise them guide them
3049672 im always amazed at what was produced but the icing on the cake is when i pick the painting that i think is strongest put it in one of the frames i have laying around and put it up on the wall
3049673 to see the way their faces light up when they see the painting in that frame i cant put a price on that
3049674 i may go home and frame that and i say yeah you can
3049675 of course it does we dont play for trophies or prize money we play to win each test

3049725 when dana whispered those life saving words to me youre still you and i love you it meant more to me than just a personal declaration of faith and commitment in a sense it was an affirmation that marriage and family stood at the center of everything and if both were intact so was your universe

3049742 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning
3049743 id wear a v neck shift and a two inch heel even if the president were taller i would keep them low otherwise it gets a little too sexy
3049744 in the end the first lady should be her mans rock and his boulder and his mountain and she should be calling about 50 percent of the shots
3049745 i started calling all these people and everybody was talking to me like i was crazy theyre like well he hasnt won yet but im like yes he has because hes gotten this far i think he gives everybody so much hope
3049746 what gives me tears is if barack obama wins kids are going to say a black man can be president too
3049747 i am not going to realistically be the policy expert on every opinion and position that barack has because i dont have the time to do it quite frankly and i have to be okay with that

3049757 i also expect to work on behalf of peace with the full knowledge that israel still has bitter enemies who are intent on its destruction we see their intentions every time a suicide bomber strikes we saw their intentions with the katusha rockets that hezbollah rained down on israel from lebanon in 2006 and we see it today in the kasams that hamas fires into israel every single day from as close as gaza or as far as tehran the defense cooperation between the united states to israel has been a model of success and i believe it can be deepened and strengthened

3049766 she basically just said yes straight away which i gather is unheard of its bizarre i was leaving the next day so we went to pitch it to a studio and fixed up a meeting with universal before i went home they said yes pretty quickly as well its about as easy as it could ever be
3049767 our aim is to upgrade our 16 domestic routes throughout thecountry by adding new aircraft with a capacity between 70 to 80seats

3049774 to be converted to be regenerated to receive grace to experience religion to gain an assurance are so many phrases which denote the process gradual or sudden by which a self hitherto divided and consciously wrong inferior and unhappy becomes united and consciously right superior and happy in consequence of its firmer hold upon religious realities

3049776 under scientific scrutiny the support for the milk myth crumbles
3049777 an animal rights organization that has only 5 percent physician membership
3049778 milk helps to integrate the consciousness other animal protein is derived from flesh and drags the consciousness down into the flesh discouraging that breaking free of early restraints which is required for spiritual advancement plant protein is sometimes insufficient to ground the consciousness firmly enough in the physical body milk is the one food that combines the uplifting essences of plants with the firm groundedness of animals
3049779 if we really want to cultivate the human spirit in society we must have first class intelligent men to guide the society and to develop the finer tissues of our brains we must assimilate vitamin values from milk devotees worship lord sri krishna by addressing him as the well wisher of the brahmanas and the cows the most intelligent class of men who have perfectly attained knowledge in spiritual values are called the brahmanas no society can improve in transcendental knowledge without the guidance of such first class men and no brain can assimilate the subtle form of knowledge without fine brain tissues for such important brain tissues we require a sufficient quantity of milk and milk preparations ultimately we need to protect the cow to derive the highest benefit from this important animal the protection of cows therefore is not merely a religious sentiment but a means to secure the highest benefit for human society

3049784 het niet meer kunnen functioneren als een gewoon gezin de leugens die over ons verteld zijn dat heeft het meest verdriet veroorzaakt samen met het gedrag van joran ik was boos op hem omdat hij gelogen heeft
3049785 ik heb geen moment gedacht dat joran een verkrachter of een moordenaar zou zijn maar ik heb wel eventjes gedacht zou er een ongeluk gebeurd zijn dat hij dat niet durft te vertellen ik weet dat hij gelogen heeft omdat hij bang was dat zijn afstudeerfeestje anders niet zou plaatsvinden dat hij niet wilde dat zijn vriendinnetje wist dat hij die nacht op pad was geweest

3049798 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3049799 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

3049820 crowds are growing the television audience is growing membership is growing media coverage is up and the game is reasonably sound
3049821 what we are wanting to make sure is the clubs also become sound but theres a lot more to do and we have some important and ambitious long term plans for the a league
3049822 a strong competition is critically important to the long term future of the game
3049823 we also want the socceroos to do well but one is not more important than the other
3049824 next season there will be 10 teams in the competition and i hope not so long after that 12 teams and maybe well end up with 14 teams but it would be wonderful if also the teams are strong at the time
3049825 the success the reputation the credibility of the a league are integral components of football going forward
3049826 you look at the quality of the players in the squad and the players weve signed and wed expect to be short priced favourites
3049827 i gave it my all unfortunately sometimes things dont want to go the right way
3049828 i was close to being right there this week just not quite
3049829 i just didnt quite get off to the start i wanted in the final round which was disappointing
3049830 were not sure there is a spot on his heel bulb that looks like it is going to bust out
3049831 when you poke it you can feel a bit of a soft spot were hoping it comes out overnight were still working on it but we are winning a bit the poultice is off again hes walking a hell of a lot better on it
3049832 if its going to happen you would rather it happen now than on the eve of a caulfield cup
3049833 we need some good equipment to get the opportunity to show what we can do
3049834 weve had some top 10 runs on ovals in the nationwide series but we havent had a really good result yet to answer the questions ive got ive really got to get in top class equipment
3049835 the clubs have too many vested and conflicting interests and are not equipped to deal with these issues consistently
3049836 sadly that is compromising the values and the brand of afl football
3049837 with acts which are offensive to society against the law and which may involve police laying charges the afl should assume control
3049838 they should be dealt with by an afl appointed tribunal chaired by a retired supreme court judge
3049839 what penalties can the afl tribunal impose financial incarceration the death penalty
3049840 it is incredulous that mr jackson thinks it acceptable that after legal process has taken place afl players should face further deliberation by an afl appointed tribunal
3049841 or worse before due legal process has taken place lets leave policing to the police adjudication to the courts and law making to parliament
3049842 ridiculous suggestions which fragment every citizens right to natural justice and constitutionally enshrined rights should be treated with the disdain they deserve
3049843 if he plays he might even have a run in the vfl he is still a bit sore we thought he would be all right this week
3049844 we will see how it settles but it is certainly short term rather than long term
3049845 we know that being green is not just a fad and being green goes well beyond using some recycled paper
3049846 no matter what you believe about global warming or climate change saving trees and water as well as using alternative energy and fewer natural resources are always the best choices as was is always innovating and this time were taking the lead in making sure that our event has the least possible negative environmental impact i wore my camelback hydration pack around ebay live and i shouldnt have been the only one doing that
3049847 in addition to making farming difficult the long grass often makes fishing difficult so the small areas unaffected are very precious and there were always clashes on fishing rights but for the first time in many years this year such disputes have disappeared
3049848 when the renovation is completed we expect that it would make trading more comfortable and attract more traders from far and near as a result pepper and fish the main commodities in the area often attract hundreds of buyers from across the state with a bigger and better market we hope to improve economic activities in these areas
3049849 water is central to human existence that is why governor sule lamido made it a major part of his plans to make jigawa people healthy and disease free so we are concentrating on the provision of water as a major part of our community development programme and i can assure you that water would reach every community in this local government
3049850 past administrations have made efforts to give us potable water in this town but water has remained a problem we are beginning to believe that we would soon forget about those problems with what we are seeing now all the hand pumps that have been giving us problems have been fixed some of them were even re dug and they are building new ones we are surely hopeful that our water problems would soon be over
3049851 guri would soon become a major player in jigawas physical human and economic development
3049852 of course there were mistakes but overall im happy with my team
3049853 we have one game remaining and well try to win it
3049854 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

3049860 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3049861 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3049862 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3049863 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3049864 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3049865 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3049866 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3049867 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3049868 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3049869 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3049870 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3049871 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3049872 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3049873 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3049874 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market
3049875 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3049876 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3049877 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3049878 nay that i do not know because i have heard
3049879 nay that i do not know because i have heard
3049880 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3049881 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3049882 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3049883 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3049884 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3049885 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3049886 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3049887 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3049888 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3049889 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3049890 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3049891 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3049892 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3049893 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3049894 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3049895 ive never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate as they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk
3049896 but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome
3049897 it is just such a feel good atmosphere of my colleagues my senior colleagues people ive known for years and i get it from some of the young people too they just feel this is such a wonderful thing in the first place to have an african american candidate nominee but also one that makes them feel so wonderful
3049898 principles and ideas do matter a lot in the world but politicians usually just use them on the way to disappointing you
3049899 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3049900 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3049901 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3049902 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3049903 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3049904 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3049905 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3049906 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3049907 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3049908 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3049909 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3049910 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3049911 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3049912 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3049913 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3049914 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3049915 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3049916 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3049917 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3049918 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3049919 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3049920 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3049921 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3049922 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3049923 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3049924 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3049925 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3049926 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3049927 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3049928 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3049929 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3049930 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3049931 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3049932 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3049933 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3049934 giving each other lap dances and sneaking in kisses in the corner

3049938 given that car insurance premiums are rising and the cost of driving is now at its highest for a number of years it is all the more important for motorists to shop around for competitive insurance
3049939 however accepting a lower premium does not mean that you have to sacrifice quality cover by shopping around you can find both just make sure when comparing car insurance policies that you do this on a like for like basis

3049961 i encourage people to seek alternative water sources for irrigation during peak season
3049962 large commercials will pay more many small commercials will see a significant decrease
3049963 the seasonal accounts have more operating costs because they exacerbate peak demand
3049964 they are also more costly administratively because we have to close them out and then reopen them each year
3049965 only 10 percent of our users will see an increase over 2 percent

3049980 the size reduction in the hippocampus seems to occur sometime after the initial exposure to stress or trauma in childhood strengthening the argument that it has something to do with ptsd itself or the stress exposure

3049987 the president has proposed a number of cuts to conservation local foods and other agricultural programs in the 2009 federal budget that were negotiated over a three year period and delicately crafted in the 2008 farm bill
3049988 we have a very clear message for congress and especially the appropriators stick with the balanced funding in the 2008 farm bill
3049989 conservation programs are historically under funded and it would be a terrible shame to turn the clock back on the environmental gains that these programs provide
3049990 we believe it is critical to send a strong message that conservation and foods programs cannot always be the source of dollars for other programs
