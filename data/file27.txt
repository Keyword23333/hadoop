270031 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
270032 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
270033 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
270034 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech

270045 iraq needs oil revenue now more than ever as they try to rebuild their country
270046 the invasion of iraq was about oil but it didnt result in more oil or cheaper gas
270047 it resulted in war profiteering by oil companies who benefited by keeping iraqi oil off the market
270048 discourage us oil companies from profiting from the war and will stop the further theft of iraqs oil resources by the very interests who have profited from the war for oil the us oil companies
270049 lo que estamos sugiriendo al ministro es que se haga un bloque latinoamericano entre gobiernos como el que se tuvo cuando se hizo un arbitraje hace unos a os formar una posici n firme y demandar ante europa la deuda moral que tiene por no cumplir el acuerdo

270066 they are collective redemption for the national suffering of the past century
270067 there is no contradiction between chinese attitudes and the spirit of the olympics
270068 talk dirty and smash the dishes when they are invited to a party

270084 ethanol gets a government backed subsidy through relief from excise duty that amounts to 42c a litre
270085 oil companies are being incentivised to import ethanol that makes it utterly uneconomic to invest in the domestic biodiesel plant we were proposing to build
270086 while the europeans praise the biofuel bill in general they are scratching their heads as to why new zealand is the only country to regulate against its own domestic industry in favour of imports
270087 this government has consistently pointed to tallow waste animal fat as an immediate biofuel resource yet when push comes to shove to get legislation through parliament it proposes to place domestic producers at severe disadvantage
270088 some politicians and lobby groups have also seized on the fact it is election year to use biofuel as a political football they are conveniently disregarding some facts and selectively using information from overseas that is not totally relevant to what biofuel manufacturers here have proposed new zealand is the loser in that game
270089 but we find it difficult to invest where our competitors are awarded what amounts to penalty tries by the referee even before the game begins
270090 new zealand needs to stop talking about its need to add value to its resources and actually do it much of its tallow resource is likely to go offshore and be converted to biodiesel which will get sold back here at a much higher price it is tantamount to selling frozen lamb or beef carcasses and letting the importers overseas make the real margins by selling the juicy cuts

270104 taking al qaeda into iran training them and sending them back
270105 common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al qaeda is going back into iran and receiving training and are coming back into iraq from iran thats well known and its unfortunate
270106 im sorry the iranians are training extremists not al qaeda

270108 its a good group of veterans that are back for camp and we are looking to those players in lake placid to push the pace lead and be at the front of things in terms of what we want in pace and tempo
270109 i think all of those players were on last years team for a reason
270110 they have a lot of character work hard and have persistence in terms of the challenges we are going to have at camp im sure they will have that mindset that they want to have a great team so im sure they will be pushing the pace
270111 we have a slightly different format this year where we are going to bring three american teams up to lake placid and have some kind of intra squad stuff going on earlier than we normally have in the past
270112 well get to games right away and get to evaluating the kids
270113 i think were getting more players involved in the camp and getting more guys experience
270114 this year were bringing in some younger players into the camp we have some 91s attending five of them some younger kids we think are going to be future players for us and we want to get them involved and see how they do in the camp
270115 it allows more players to have the experience and really gives us the opportunity to look at a wider variety of players theres a lot of players that we may not have a lot of information on that we would like to see at that level
270116 i just saw one of the democrats interviewed on television the question was if oil was 10 a gallon and you knew exactly where to get it in alaska or on the coast would you drill there and there was no answer
270117 we think we need to have more sources of energy use energy more efficiently and invest in the future thats all we want to have that debate we think those are winning ideas in america today but for whatever reason the leaders of this congress the democrat leaders of this congress are afraid of those ideas
270118 many of us speaking on the floor today including the republican leadership believe the president of the united states should call this congress back into session immediately under article ii of the constitution and demand that this congress deal with the issue of energy independence
270119 i am prepared to stay here as long as we can
270120 we believe the challenger of record has to be a real yacht club

270130 as a direct and proximate result of the university of central floridas negligence ereck plancher collapsed and died
270131 the plancher family has been frustrated by the fact that they have not been able to get an accurate account of what happened during the conditioning drills on march 18 they feel very strongly that they do not want any other families to go through what they are going through

270139 the public doesnt want to be subjected to people talking on their cell phones on an already over packed airplane
270140 however with internet access just around the corner on u s flights it wont be long before the ban on voice communications on in flight planes is lifted our bill the hang up act would ensure that financially strapped airlines dont drive us towards this noisome disruption in search of further revenue
270141 cell phone users should not be able to disrupt the comfort of an entire airplane cabin especially when other passengers have no choice but to sit there and listen
270142 this bill will ensure a relative amount of peace for the american public as they take to an increasingly crowded sky
270143 the business of the natural philosopher is to construct theories which will save appearances most of us first meet this expression in paradise lost viii 82 and most of us perhaps originally misunderstood it milton is translating greek script first used so far as we know by simplicius in his commentary on the aristotlean de caelo a scientific theory must save or reserve the appearances the phenomena it deal with in the sense of getting them all in doing justice to them thus for example your phenomena are luminous points in the night sky which exhibit such and such movements in relation to one another and in relation to an observer at a particular point or various chosen points on the surface of the earth your astronomical theory will be a supposal such that if it were true the apparent motions from the point or points of observation would be those you have actually observed the theory will then have got in or saved the appearances but if we demanded no more than that from a theory science would be impossible for a lively inventive faculty could devise a good many different supposals which would equally save the phenomena we havce therefore had to supplement the canon of saving the phenomena by another canon first perhaps formulated with full clarity by occam according to this second canon we must accept provisionally not any theory which saves the phenomena but that theory which does so with the fewest possible assumptions thus the two theories that a the bad bits in shakespeare were all put in by adapters and b that shakespeare wrote them when he was not at his best will equally save the appearances but we already know that there was such a person as shakespeare and that writers are not always at their best if scholarship hopes ever to achieve the steady progress of the sciences we must therefore provisionally accept the second theory in every age it will be apparent to accurate thinkers that scientific theories being arrived at in the way i have described are never statements of fact that stars appear to move in such and such ways or that substances behaved thus and thus in the laboratory these are statements of fact the astronomical or chemical theory can never be more than provisional it will have to be abandoned if a more ingenious person thinks of a supposal which would save the observed phenomena with still fewer assumptions or if we discover new phenomena which it cannot save at all this would i believe be recognized by all thoughtful scientists today it was recognized by newton if as i am told he wrote not the attraction varies inversely as the square of the distance but all happens as if it so varied it was certainly recognized in the middle ages in astronomy
270144 it took place when copernicus probably it cannot be regarded as certain began to think and others like kepler and galileo began to affirm that the heliocentric hypothesis not only saved the appearances but was physically true it was not simply a new theory of the nature of celestial movements that was feared but a new theory of the nature of theory namely that if a hypothesis saves all the appearances it is identical with truth
270145 the nineteenth century still held the belief that by inferences from our sense experience improved by instruments we could know the ultimate physical reality more or less as by maps pictures and travel books a man can know a country he has not visited and that in both cases the truth would be a sort of mental replica of the thing itself philosophers might have disquieting comments to make on this conception but scientists and plain men did not much attend to them
270146 without a parable modern physics speaks not to the multitudes
270147 the great masters do not take any model quite so seriously as the rest of us
270148 most modern players are aware of the realism and skill of the pes series
270149 it is a game that truly mirrors the pace and control of real football and as a die hard fan of the series i am delighted to be working with konami on the latest version
270150 lionel messi is an incredibly exciting player and one who enjoys a world wide reputation for skill pace and all round ability
270151 as such he is the ideal player to front pes 2009 and his enthusiasm for the new game is certain to shine as we work closely together in the promotion of what will be the most advanced pes title to date

270178 the combination of efficiency power performance and design make the a4 the new segment standard
270179 these are all new models with added standard features versus the previous generation and the a4 when equipped with the all new 2 0tfsi engine and quattro all wheel drive system delivers better fuel economy and acceleration than the key competitors in this segment
270180 especially after the a4 hit the auto show circuit and photos started to appear consumer interest increased as fuel prices rose the new 2 0 tfsi is a great engine add the new engine to the beautiful design and incredible vehicle technology and i feel that this is the perfect car for the time
270181 gostei da atua o mas em se tratando de sele o brasileira a gente sempre espera algo mais inclusive os jogadores falta ainda velocidade o que normal e j era esperado pois em in cio de trabalho o correto e coerente dar prioridade ao trabalho de for a e resist ncia
270182 os exerc cios que s o feitos nos treinos j come aram a dar resultados j houve uma maior aproxima o os jogadores encostaram mais para as jogadas de tabela e os atacantes passaram a entrar em diagonal

270185 ele cresceu ap s a gera o baby boomer onda de natalidade entre 1946 e come o dos anos 60 ap s as divis es culturais dos anos 1960

270188 ele bush com certeza est entre os presidentes menos efetivos e produtivos de todos os tempos
270189 ou alguns diriam um dos piores presidentes de todos os tempos
270190 ele sabe pol tica desde negociar at princ pios um pol tico muito completo
270191 advogar pela mudan a e por novas id ias mas ao mesmo tempo ele precisa garantir s pessoas que ele algu m confi vel que ir administrar com cuidado e de forma profissional
270192 tem uma mensagem de esperan a muito vaga mas que inspira muitos pessoas e passa muita credibilidade o p blico est exausto dos republicanos
270193 os ltimos 30 ou 40 anos no ocidente foram os anos da pol tica das diferen as a constitui o e consolida o de minorias de todo tipo tnico sexual etc
270194 isso foi um movimento necess rio para correr atr s do ideal universalista da modernidade a id ia de direitos iguais e efetivos para todos
270195 um movimento cujo tiro saiu pela culatra fragmentando o tecido social negando o pr prio ideal universalista que de repente pareceu ser reduzido globaliza o econ mica
270196 nunca como agora apareceu a contradi o entre a necessidade de afirmar as diferen as e o sonho de uma sociedade de direitos iguais
270197 nesse contexto que a candidatura de obama produz um apelo muito especial

270210 now is a good time for coders to insure their clinical familiarity with the conditions included in the expanded list of conditions and be able to understand and recognize the clinical signs and symptoms of some of these conditions
270211 this heightened clinical awareness will best serve the coder because he or she will be able to recognize when clinical documentation is deficient and properly craft a physician query
270212 a physician or other qualified provider must document these it cannot be a wound care nurse or a floor nurse
270213 the physician also must designate whether it was present on admission

270218 the failure of the talks is a real loss for consumers in china india and in the u s and europe
270219 it will also really hurt low cost food producers in brazil argentina australia new zealand and south africa ultimately china and india will have to relent or the west may begin to complain about free trade conditions for manufacturing and services that manufacturing free trade policy has been the source of a considerable amount of chinas and indias economic growth
270220 most of the decline in trade this year will be due to the credit market and housing related economic slowdown in the u s not due to the breakdown of the global trade talks
270221 and as soon as u s economic growth revs back up trade growth will increase
270222 abebooks will continue to function as a stand alone operation based in victoria british columbia

270228 when we started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving this club and he knew my desire
270229 my desire was to stay at this club so for me hes like my father hes my boss so whatever he tells me ill do it so our relationship at the moment is always strong
270230 mom she has been reading the bible we gave her and today i asked her if she wanted to pray to jesus and give her life to him and she said yes we prayed right there in her room
270231 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders
270232 at no point did this board or management in any way ever resist microsofts proposal
270233 we proactively engaged with them and tried to reach a positive conclusion for shareholders
270234 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
270235 they were given two weeks the two weeks is up this weekend
270236 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
270237 the iranians sent mixed messages this week and its very hard to tell what the bottom line is
270238 if its in 16 days instead of 14 its not a problem we are not obsessed with a date
270239 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
270240 sit down youll have a chance to ask your questions but you dont want to disrupt the whole meeting just be courteous
270241 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
270242 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
270243 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
270244 i was a civil rights lawyer i passed the first racial profiling legislation in illinois
270245 i passed some of the toughest death penalty reform legislation in illinois so these are issues ive worked on for decades
270246 now that doesnt mean that im going always to satisfy the way you guys want these issues framed which gives you the option of voting for somebody else it gives you the option to run for office yourself
270247 the only way that were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together black white hispanic asians and native american young old disabled gay straight
270248 now to inject this race card issue you know it takes it one step beyond that
270249 i will not allow anyone in this campaign to attack john mccain on race and its never happened before and it never will again and we are not going to allow the obama campaign to put this on the table
270250 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
270251 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
270252 after these violent attacks we have had to suspend activities and evacuate all our staff from tawila and shangil tobaya
270253 the suspension of activities leaves more than 65 000 civilians the majority of them displaced people without medical assistance
270254 it is impossible for our teams to work and provide medical aid without a minimum guarantee of security and respect for humanitarian work
270255 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
270256 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
270257 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
270258 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
270259 at this time im not aware of what may have provoked this attack
270260 i can confirm the victim was stabbed and that the victim was pronounced dead at the scene
270261 this is one of the most horrific crimes i have ever heard in my life
270262 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
270263 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilisation he was not fit to plan or execute
270264 he was not with the ideology of osama bin laden and people like him he was only searching for pleasure and money in this life
270265 he is intending to invoke self incrimination rights and not appear
270266 despite the wage agreement it will take up to two more weeks before flight service is normalised
270267 this is an outcome that of course is not painless for either side
270268 but the fact that we were able to resolve the wage conflict internally sends an important message to our passengers and also to our staff and about germany as a place to do business
270269 in the end we reached an outcome that of course does not meet all of our colleagues expectations but that verdi can live with
270270 if you include the one off payment the wage agreement is higher than that in many manufacturing sectors
270271 compared to other service sector deals verdi is in the upper tier with this one
270272 i think i can win a masters series and id love to do it this week i played well last week and had a tight match against nadal
270273 this week im playing well again you know hopefully i can do it
270274 he was serving well and i threw in a lot of unforced errors but once i got going i played really well
270275 ive never been to the final of a masters but this looks like my best chance im playing well enough and can hopefully come through
270276 to go two breaks down a set and two breaks down would have been tough to come back from
270277 were not seeing the level of layoffs you tend to see in a recession at this point what we are really tending to see is a lack of new hiring
270278 the fed will do nothing next week the fed will keep fed funds at 2 0 per cent voice its concern about the longer term inflation threats from commodity prices
270279 we know were in a soft economy perhaps its going to soften further over the next six months but there are not any crystal clear signals that were heading into a deep recession or anything nearing that

270290 the politburo of the communist party of india marxist records with profound grief the passing away of comrade harkishan singh surjeet veteran leader of the cpi m an outstanding figure of the communist movement of the country and prominent national politician
270291 the seven and a half decades long political life of harkishan singh surjeet began with his staunch fight against british colonial rule
270292 surjeet began his revolutionary career influenced by the martyrdom of bhagat singh
270293 in common with the pioneering communist leaders surjeet displayed amply the capacity to sacrifice and undergo difficulties he spent ten years in jail of which eight were in the pre independence period he also spent eight years underground

270306 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
270307 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans

270339 i think youre involved in overplaying your hand with microsoft and i think youve overstayed your welcome as directors
270340 thats simply a miscategorization misunderstanding and misconception of those negotiations
270341 you lack true morality which is the morality of obligation and it already cost this company money and your shareholders money
270342 i have personally been involved in discussing how we can improve human rights with just as many people as you can imagine
270343 and we have a lot more work to do i think we still have an issue and still condemnd the chinese government for their harming and blocking people from expressing their opinions on the net
270344 youre not seeing a lot of 80 year olds coming in with texting injuries they do tend to be a younger demographic and then depending on whether youre in the city or not that determines what we see in a city where theres a lot of driving and commuting were seeing the most accidents related to texting which can be very serious or even fatal
270345 in cities where people are pedestrians and walkers like new york chicago and baltimore where there is a lot of pedestrian traffic were seeing a lot of falls because people arent paying attention can you walk and chew gum except that this is more than chewing gum because youre really concentrating on something else
270346 normally when you fall you put your hands out reflexively to protect your face if you have anything in your hand youre not able to drop it as quickly and protect your face so were seeing a lot of facial and head injuries chins and even eye injuries where people were poked in the eye
270347 she was unconscious and it appeared shed suffered a massive brain injury you could tell she saw the truck at the last moment because her cell phone was dropped right where she was struck just off the curb and she was thrown about 20 or 30 feet it was horrifying the truck stopped the driver was devastated i was amazed to hear she survived all the way to trauma center but died in the er
270348 no 1 if youre involved in any type of activity that requires concentration including walking you really shouldnt be texting obviously that goes for even more concentration reliant activities such as biking rollerblading playing a sport and of course driving you really shouldnt do it if you get a message while walking that you have to respond to you should get out of the flow of traffic stand somewhere then read or send a message
270349 with everything thats going on with cell phones and the jury is out about the electromagnetic rays i dont think texting is a bad thing for kids to do we still dont know long term what the effects of prolonged cell phone use are
270350 consumers want a quality internet experience that requires a combination of industry investment innovation and self governance along with appropriate government oversight to shine the light on any potential problems with individual practices or providers

270352 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission ftc engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed

270375 what is hunch well as you might assume it is a consumer internet application it will have a lot of user participation and it is more than a little fun beyond that were still making it up
270376 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
270377 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
270378 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
270379 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
270380 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
270381 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
270382 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
270383 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
270384 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
270385 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
270386 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
270387 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
270388 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
270389 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
270390 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
270391 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas
270392 new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
270393 the company is considering a site that is more than 120 acres in the triad business park in kernersville

270395 shajarian is a superstar the pavarotti of persian classical music
270396 persepolis is the poignant story of a young girl in iran during the islamic revolution
270397 over the last two years ive worked closely with her on several initiatives on strategic sourcing she was instrumental she will work with senior procurement executives until the next president takes over
270398 with over 400 billion and a significant portion of the discretionary budget going to procurement theyre going to have to give a high priority to strengthening the workforce
270399 steered clear of afge because of our leading role in the fight against privatization
270400 we can judge him exclusively on his record which is one of faithfully carrying out the administrations competitive sourcing agenda and directing agencies to conduct costly and controversial privatization studies
270401 in ofpp that can be tough because youre in omb
270402 but you really do need to do these things even if it does cost additional money
270403 in theory this new policy should prevent supervisors from retaliating against tsos who blow the whistle on wrongdoing and security breaches
270404 while these safeguards are an improvement to the current system they fall short of affording tsos full whistleblower protections
270405 the american traveling public should see this agreement as improving their safety and security
270406 any agreement that can be revoked by tsa on thirty days notice essentially keeps the whistleblower rights of tsa employees in the hands of management
270407 of course would there ever be a satisfying outcome to this shocking saga in our post 9 11 history
270408 what you need to know about mortgages and real estate and more
270409 im ready to duel john mccain on taxes right here quick draw
270410 if barack obama wants this so called duel then why did he and his entourage run for the hills when john mccain challenged him to 10 town halls
270411 these anxieties seem to be growing with each passing day
270412 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing my opponent john mccain thinks were on the right track
270413 vhf heck traded mine in for a sweet dvd player right when they first came out oooh listen to the tugboat toot hi tugboat
270414 oh you told me that way back at the beginning of july
270415 and when we had that cool spell i almost believed you
270416 i know weve still got all of august and sometimes thats when the hottest days of the year are but statistically were already past the hottest part of the summer the days are getting shorter and everyone knows that the second half of anything good goes by way faster than the first half
270417 this is the best world cup ever i wish it never had to end
270418 im a businessman im not here because i think youre nice people i think theres money to be made
270419 i also have this wonderful sense that were doing the right thing were going to employ thousands of iraqis but mostly everything here is for profit
270420 so theres danger everywhere i think the key thing is this will be tremendous for baghdad
270421 even the idea of bringing u s style escapism entertainment to the hell of baghdad is absurd
270422 just watch how much of this infrastructure even gets built
270423 even if they do pull this off then the parks immediate survival like any private business is going to depend on stability and the ability of the iraqi government to control violence and ensure public safety
270424 if the situation in baghdad deteriorates i think the idea that the park will somehow be spared violence is sadly naive at best
270425 the bush junta has already attempted to impose a neo liberal economic disneyland upon the iraqi people
270426 but they have flatly rejected the neurosis of its brand conscious failed capitalism the two geographies meet nowhere in my imagination nor in reality the not so green zone is barely inured from the death destruction and suffering which surrounds it the point is that no gated community is safe from mortars and rockets i believe we are looking at the next evolution of the gated community albeit grossly failed
270427 people are fascinated by the effects of wars on zoos think of emir kusturicas 1995 movie underground or marjan the one eyed lion of the kabul zoo right now people are following this as a news of the weird story but i hope you or someone revisits it in a few years if the baghdad zoo and entertainment experience is thriving and iraqis are visiting then it will be a wonderful testament to the countrys progress if however its an empty space then it will be a testament to a larger self delusion
270428 most annoying questions a non guitar player asks a guitar player

270431 the purpose of the necp is to promote the ability of emergency response providers and relevant government officials to continue to communicate in the event of natural disasters acts of terrorism and other man made disasters and to ensure accelerate and attain interoperable emergency communications nationwide

270474 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale during that time i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away but senator obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country

270476 i dont understand why so many people are surprised that this book is a failure pelosi is a vaccuous empty suit who represents an amoral left wing cesspool of a district its only natural that her book is going to be nothing more than a collection of egocentric blathering offering nothing more than rehashed platitudes designed to make her appear smarter than she is which is admittedly not much of a challenge
270477 did she even read her own book this reads like so many political books where we slap the pages together plaster an impressive photo on the cover and shove it our the door and down our throats
270478 how about a reasoned argument for the bone headed decisions she has made as speaker
270479 this is a book full of feeble minded ideas it is not well written and frankly it was a waste of my time and money to read it at all for a woman with so much promise nancy pelosi disappoints once again she should spend less time preventing gas prices from coming down and more time writing a quality book sorry nancy this book is a dud and so are you

270522 pakistans federally administered tribal areas fata are wilder than the wild west because al qaeda has resurfaced here in the form of a new breed of taliban who are threatening both afghanistan and pakistan
270523 like an arrow that has left the bow and flown wide of the mark jihad in the modern world has become a political weapon with which to threaten believers and unbelievers alike
270524 only by retrieving the arrow and straightening its jagged edges and twisted feathers can muslims aspire to attain those high ethical values which are the embodiment of faith iman based on submission to god islam
270525 u s pakistan relations have been difficult in the best of times
270526 they are today at a cross roads with grave consequences for the future course of the war on terror if losing afghanistan is out of the question for the usa and nato then it is vital to understand why losing pakistan is simply not an option if peace is to prevail in the world

270540 this is huge its a giant step but its not enough to ensure that internet users are protected
270541 is the next step for the fcc to mandate that network owners must ask the government for permission before serving their customers by managing surges of information flow
270542 as a result of todays actions internet lawyers around the country are likely advising their clients to do just that
270543 we dont know if this is going to be crippling or really damaging
270544 foot in the door for big government to regulate the internet
270545 now that they have that foot in the door i fully expect that it will be exploited for everything its worth to grow the scope of the fccs coercive bureaucratic authority over all things digital
270546 for their superior understanding of the need to check monopoly and duopoly isps who attempt to act as online gatekeepers and for their historic and courageous action today
270547 stopping discriminatory network management practices is important to the flow of information in our democracy and to the economic growth that is made possible by an open internet
270548 regardless of how one views the merits of the complaint against comcast the fcc today has shown that its national internet policies work and that they are more than sufficient for handling any net neutrality concerns that may arise
270549 the entire industry should redouble its efforts to set standards for transparency and ensure that consumers know what they are getting when purchasing access or using applications
270550 and we should get ahead of the curve in developing and adopting sound network management practices as new services emerge

270586 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
270587 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard

270599 i completely understand the frustration of best of lists and i can assure you that i read hundreds of comments here on the yahoo music blogs whenever we post one many times our best album lists generate thousands of comments and although many of the remarks are ridiculous many are valid in a subjective sort of way for this playlist i wanted to find the true top 20 albums once and for all but to do this i needed to clear my mind of all opinion and approach it as a science my own personal taste did not influence this list in any way in fact i would have made many different choices but the time i put into collecting the data and crunching the numbers leaves no doubt in my mind that this is the most accurate top 20 album list in existence

270684 the morning after this incident sheriff gobble called me from cozumel requesting that bobby queen be arrested for reckless endangerment at that point i told sheriff gobble that would not happen until after the an investgation has been completed the office of the district attorney is presently evaluating that information and sheriff gobble is in no way responsible for whatever action is taken in this case
270685 im really excited about this one in the 1946 series the b p r d was just two guys and one of them died in 1947 we see the humble beginnings of the bureau we know and love today
270686 we meet new agents some of whom will actually survive and we see more of young hellboy we start to see where his personality comes from and there are vampires my favorite creatures as we have never seen them before in the hellboy b p r d world and josh and i get to work with gabriel and f bio who really are geniuses i cant wait to see what they do
270687 this is a unique tale needing a unique approach and bringing f bio and gabriel into the family of hellboy artists is really exciting to all involved
270688 their work is amazing and were giving them an epic gothic tale a moody and shadowy nightmare unlike anything theyve done and darker scarier and more mysterious than anything weve done in such a long format
270689 lots of dreamy fantastic imagery and lots of muted character beats ive been a fan of f bio since i first read de tales i cant wait to see them dance on this thing
270690 sure anybody could be making a wow killer but were probably the ones making it
270691 on behalf of the people of missouri i want to applaud mr carter for displaying political courage something thats not been seen lately by many of his democrat colleagues he was the first to clarify his position on missourians right to bear arms and his action should be commended
270692 although mr carters were not made publicly prior to the supreme court ruling we will give him the benefit of the doubt that his beliefs on this important issue are heartfelt we also have not been able to find any public statements that would contradict what mr carter stated privately to us
270693 for many democrat politicians it is easy to remain silent and mislead voters but showing political courage is sometimes costly and mike carter has chosen to take the path less travelled we commend him and hope that other missouri democrats will have the courage to respond to our challenge unfortunately we suspect most democrats particularly those like sam page will lie and mislead voters
270694 a lot of politicians are trying to change their stripes on this issue and we are outraged by sam pages statements because we have always found him to be staunchly anti second amendment while lt governor kinder has always been a vocal supporter of our right to bear arms under the constitution
270695 im fernsehen sieht man es nur einmal online so oft man will

270698 i was just thinking about me i just kept thinking nothing but me i just kept saying sammyglicksammyglick over and over inside my head and it kept growing louder sammyglicksammyglicksammyglick i guess that dont quite make sense does it
270699 the expression of the genes that encode the clock is altered under high fat diets it is as if the diet erodes away the clock or causes it to rust
270700 one cheeseburger fries a coke ice cream and go on then a portion of chicken
270701 population wide approaches designed to reduce caloric intake and increase physical activity without affecting nutritional sufficiency might be best suited for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and diabetes
270702 people are inherently contradictory and nowhere is it more obvious than on such a sensitive and important issue as their weight the results show theres a world of people who cannot deny themselves that hamburger or extra piece of pizza but probably make themselves feel better by washing it down with a diet cola
270703 como m nimo el ex presidente fujimori pose a informaci n suficiente que le permit a concluir que se ven an cometiendo estos cr menes desde la estructura estatal pero no actu para prevenirlos
270704 tampoco cumpli con la obligaci n de investigar y sancionar a los responsables de estos delitos todo lo contrario se adoptaron medidas legislativas y judiciales promovidas por el ejecutivo para favorecer a los miembros del grupo colina ex post facto
270705 el tribunal no tiene ninguna intervencion ni siquiera le han comunicado de cambios penitenciarios la primera palabra la tiene el instituto nacional penitenciario inpe
270706 el nivel del f tbol en la rep blica checa lo conocemos todos y se ha demostrado en la eurocopa por lo que ser un desafi bastante dif cil

270708 yo esperaba un equipo ingl s el destino reparte ciertas cartas y nos ha repartido esta carta por un lado es muy pero muy dif cil lo sabemos pero por el otro es muy emocionante
270709 me uno a la iniciativa de algunos personajes vinculados al sport boys para ayudarlo a salir de este mal momento econ mico como se sabe el conjunto rosado hasta hace unos d as estuvo a punto de perder la categor a por no poder cancelar la deuda de m s de 27 mil d lares a la agremiaci n de futbolistas

270711 oh by the way i gotta talk to you about something else too i sold juelz contract to def jam for 2 million dollars
270712 but its still dipset for life its just going to be a new chapter
270713 i have no hard feeling for cam after all he did give me a chance
270714 but i will say this i was loyal to him and he took advantage
270715 i came up with the concept for krimson by kwame years ago
270716 in my line of work i always have to wear a suit and tie and i decided that instead of going out and purchasing other brands i would start my own
270717 as it turns out he already had the infrastructure ready to manufacture the ties and i had the creative vision for the company and designs for the ties all laid out
270718 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
270719 never in history has a federal court invalidated a law regulating the private ownership of firearms on second amendment grounds indeed that the second amendment poses no barrier to strong gun laws is perhaps the most well settled proposition in american constitutional law
270720 some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia we cannot say that the second amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument
270721 i pay you guys all that money and this is the best you can come up with
270722 would you all stop loving this guy so much please
270723 mcconnell is going to spend millions of dollars trying to destroy my reputation
270724 pawlenty is john mccains choice and that the announcement is coming very soon
270725 i stopped talking about the vice presidential issue for all the reasons we talked about last week and earlier today but i really appreciate you asking
270726 reelected in one of the toughest reelection years in the history of the republican party his father i am pretty sure drove a truck he has been pretty successfully able to work across the aisle in minnesota with the democrats
270727 takes on features of one of hadids grand scale designs with cut out holes for the toes and diagonally sloping straps
270728 this was a very challenging project not only in design but on the technical side
270729 tweak it the way he would want it to be
270730 in preservation circles that gives it a special kind of significance
270731 the building and spaces inside have never been entirely embraced by atlanta and fulton county residents
270732 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
270733 he met her out there they were not a couple they had only known each other for a short time
270734 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
270735 it shall be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed
270736 were going to display a sense of humor in this campaign
270737 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
270738 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
270739 earned a place in the not just in the state of florida but nationally
270740 the official a frequent participant in who has since left government says a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being held and interrogated on the island
270741 according to this single source who requested anonymity because of the classified nature of the discussions the u s may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters
270742 i thought it would it have been around 40 percent withheld i thought it would be more than last year
270743 i have no problem with yahoo as a company i have a problem with the board
270744 theres a lot happening downtown brighton has a lot of national connections this should be very good for denver and the site
270745 i dont know whether i could say they got a bad deal but i think we got a heck of a deal
270746 the newspaper agency was very cognizant that if they would divide it up and cut it up they absolutely could have gotten a higher price but what they wanted was a bulk sale where they had a quick close to get rid of it they positioned it as it as a printing press site and we marketed it as one of the few remaining sites in a central location along that corridor that is minutes from downtown
270747 it would be even more reasonable once it actually closes it will be interesting to see if graham gets that done if he does he has done a heck of a job or he was really lucky and he got the timing exactly right and obviously our timing was off
270748 when you look at the metrics of a 25 per square foot land deal that would seem it could only be supported only if they could develop residential on the site
270749 i grew up in denver and if you lok at that community around alameda square that is a true urban renewal redevelopment which has the support of the entire neighborhood
270750 its a great re use for that under utilized site
270751 iban a las iglesias latinas y les dec an que tra an una bendici n de dios que si ellos se inclu an en esta tribu pod an tener residencia legal y ciudadan a

270753 following discussions the ioc has held with the organizers of the on the difficulties experienced this week in accessing some web sites the ioc is pleased to see that the issues are quickly being resolved
270754 the media should be seeing a noticeable difference in accessibility to web sites that they need to report on the olympic games
270755 this access has always been assured by bocog the and the chinese authorities and the ioc is pleased to see these are assurances being upheld
270756 this is good news of course but it continues to be unacceptable that the chinese government can decide according to its mood which web sites are censored and which are accessible
270757 and how long will these sites be available to the 253 million chinese internet users who continue to be subject to massive online censorship
270758 my pioneer dvr 420hs has an analog tuner thus when the digital transition kicks in the tuner on my dvd recorder will no longer work most dvd recorders out there right now have analog tuners so they will all be obsolete
270759 models without tuners are fine for use with cable boxes or satellite tuners
270760 another piece of evidence that the problems the company faces have no short term fixes and we would continue to avoid the shares
270761 sun continues to restructure and focus on cost cutting which we think will result in improved profitability when demand improves
270762 remain under pressure as suns core fundamentals continue to deteriorate
270763 theres no doubt that i played into the image that was portrayed in the press portrayed in peoples description of why they liked metallica
270764 i didnt want to disappoint i wanted to be that guy i wanted to put that mask on and then keeping the mask on 24 hours became suffocating and i could not do it anymore
270765 until we hear from apple its hard to say what the real reason is because if it was at amp t well at amp t is not the iphone service provider outside the u s
270766 the iphone is not intended to be used as a tethering device and we have no plans to offer separate tethering plans for it
270767 we offer laptopconnect cards that you can use to access our wireless data network those cards offer typical download speeds as high as 1 7 mbps
270768 for customers looking for a smartphone with tethering capability we have many other options
270769 sorry to all the folks that couldnt get it in time
270770 were hoping well get some feedback from apple tomorrow at the very least i would hope apple will allow it in countries where the provider does permit tethering
270771 another piece of evidence that the problems the company faces have no short term fixes and we would continue to avoid the shares
270772 sun continues to restructure and focus on cost cutting which we think will result in improved profitability when demand improves
270773 remain under pressure as suns core fundamentals continue to deteriorate
270774 even after apples update was applied systems running the client version of mac os x were still incrementing ports not randomizing them as should have been the case if the fix had addressed the flaw
270775 we said in the past that we expect to see additional cases of pml and the food and drug administration has said as much as well it is also clearly stated on our label and in all communications around the product and communications with doctors
270776 we believe the risk benefit profile of the drug remains favorable
270777 clearly the patients taking the drug made the choice to be on tysabri because its such an effective therapy despite being fully aware of the risk of pml
270778 well jesus is nailed to a corpse for our sees does that let you be happy
270779 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
270780 i think youre overpaid on compensation and youve overstayed your welcome
270781 will you do the honorable thing if theres a high against vote and step down from this board
270782 they said to one of our management people there may be a few more dollars on the table
270783 i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and youve overstayed your welcome
270784 26 hours in a 24 hour days in the last six months
270785 obviously we had planned this long before the proxy fight
270786 the historic event that unfolded today on the floor of the peoples house was about more than gas prices
270787 today house republicans and the american people stood side by side to make history together we sent a powerful message to speaker pelosi senators reid and obama and other top democrats that we will not rest until they allow a vote for more american energy and lower gas prices and we sent a powerful message that the passion to make our voices heard will never be extinguished by the heavy handed actions of the out of touch democratic majority house republicans and the american people showed today that we will stand united together on the most important issue facing our nation and we will fight boldly until congress finally heeds our will
270788 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
270789 it was them talking about security engineering and how they take security seriously
270790 due to circumstances beyond my control i regret that i will not be able to participate in black hat this year
270791 to prove to myself that i was the man i had always wanted to be
270792 enter public life determined to tell the truth to put problem solving ahead of partisanship to defend the public interest against the special interests to risk your personal ambitions for the sake of the country and the ideals that make her great keep your promise to america and you will keep your honor you will know a happiness far more sublime than pleasure
270793 my husband was arrested over a year ago and has yet to stand trial
270794 we demand the immediate release of our sons who are being held unjustly
270795 i pray everything returns to normal soon so we can continue to live a peaceful life
270796 will come out with a comprehensive statement on future bilateral engagement
270797 its really sad the two sides have started fighting again its triggered all kinds of fears
270798 were all praying for calm on the borders clashes only bring death and destruction
270799 i was married here i had my five children here and i want to die here
270800 the settlers threatened us they offered us millions of dollars to go live somewhere else but we are staying
270801 why here first its a beautiful place its quiet but also to take back jewish properties people wanted to live close to shimons tomb its a special place for us
270802 justice is on our side we dont put a gun on your head and and say get out he says
270803 they are nothing more than a right to farm dating from 1879 not mentioning any name nor the precise place
270804 our history is nothing more than a simple matter of property ownership
270805 it is part of a deliberate policy of driving us out of jerusalem so they can take total control
270806 if they can claim houses in east jerusalem we can claim houses in west jerusalem
270807 there were attacks that targeted senior officers and we thank god they failed and our colleagues are safe
270808 investigations are still ongoing to see who was behind the attacks and it is too early to point out motives although they appeared to be of al qaeda style
270809 on monday morning july 21 we were startled by an explosion in the house of colonel issa al issawi who is known as the leader of the campaign against militants in fallujah and surroundings house
270810 to our surprise the explosion took place on the roof where at least four guards were posted
270811 one of them was warning his colleagues that the other was a suicide attacker and asking them to take cover then another policeman fired towards both of them
270812 all of us ran away and then the second bomb went off many policemen were killed and injured in the two blasts these have again ended our dreams of security
270813 colonel issawi has been a police officer for over 20 years meaning he is one of saddam husseins officers who agreed to continue although the country was occupied by the americans
270814 people of fallujah know that he helped al qaeda worked with the islamic party and now is the right arm of the american occupation
270815 we knew that many of the members of the awakening forces were members of al qaeda
270816 it was said that about 100 young men were executed inside fallujah police station by the awakening militias in january and february 2007 it became clear later that the executioners were fallujah police leaders following orders issued by the us military from the headquarters next door
270817 it seems that we iraqis will all kill each other as long as this us occupation is paying our leaders to widen the gap between us
270818 four hamas militants including mohammad ghazal a member of the hamas leadership in the west bank have been released on abbas orders
270819 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and this could include up to 1 000 civilians
270820 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
270821 this is a baseless allegation that the new york times keeps on recycling using anonymous sources these stories always die afterwards because there is no proof
270822 this is a national institution which is vital for security the isis role in fighting terrorism and extremism is exceptional
270823 the indians are absolutely convinced its true and theyre right
270824 the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region
270825 we need to know whose side the army and the isi really are on
270826 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
270827 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the us
270828 the danger is not that modernization will be sacrificed to fund asymmetric capabilities but rather that in the future we will again neglect the latter
270829 retreat from openness and democracy could have significant security implications for the united states
270830 i dont see either nation as a threat to the us at this point but they are both investing in modernization programs that are of concern
270831 this approach tailors investment of substantial but not infinite resources in ways that favor key enduring us strategic advantages
270832 at the same time we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to china if necessary
270833 to bully its neighbors all of which are cause for concern
270834 all of these actions suggest a russia exploring renewed influence
270835 will be defined by a global struggle against a violent extremist ideology that seeks to overturn the international state system
270836 mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
270837 help shrink the ungoverned areas of the world and thereby deny extremists and other hostile parties sanctuary
270838 we must also be prepared to act quickly to secure those weapons and materials in cases where a state loses control of its weapons especially nuclear devices
270839 should the worst happen and we are attacked we must be able to sustain operations during that attack and help mitigate the consequences of weapons of mass destruction attacks at home or overseas
270840 for civilians to fight for eight hours means they were heavily armed
270841 mr holbrooke undertook on behalf of the us that i would not be tried before this tribunal
270842 not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena not give interviews and not even publish literary works in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
270843 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic just as long as i left pale
270844 for them subjects like the nuclear issue are pretexts the key reason for the hostility of the enemies in the past 30 years against iran is that they want us to pull back so that they can say we have given in
270845 but the iranian people will resist with force against the enemies
270846 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
270847 the iranians sent mixed messages this week and its very hard to tell what the bottom line is
270848 we hope to have a clear answer either today or tomorrow but if it comes monday what difference does it make
270849 if its in 16 days instead of 14 its not a problem we are not obsessed with a date
270850 the states duty is to urge these people to return to lebanon
270851 i am glad for always being on speaker berris mind but the truth is that i cannot compete with his sense of humor
270852 it took us 14 sessions to draft the new governments policy statement but i believe that the final output will be good for all and will unify the lebanese
270853 upon reading the ministerial statement you will realize that the state is the authority in charge of providing security and safety for the people liberation is also part of the states duties
270854 nobody wants to ignore the sacrifices that the resistance had made in the past years to end occupation but no party can monopolize resistance and accuse others of being against it
270855 past circumstances have led to the rise of some popular movements but this does not change the fact that the only solution for lebanon is to have the armed and security forces defend the country and preserve security
270856 the army is the resistance and the state is the resistance state institutions particularly the armed forces are lebanons only salvation
270857 as if they expect us to hold the resistance accountable for its victories over the enemy israel and liberate its detainees and martyrs
270858 this is because the israeli occupation possesses a us and european umbrella that is trying to prevent lebanon from defending itself on the military level and from pushing for the implementation of un resolution 1701 when it comes to banning israeli violations of lebanons airspace and waters
270859 this is the secret of political chaos in lebanon the arena and farm which the international community is preventing from being a state
270860 we want the resistance to put its hands into those of the lebanese army
270861 we ask all parties to protect the army and the resistance so that they remain lebanons shield
270862 weapons should be put in trustworthy hands away from sensitivities and regional sectarianism
270863 dont be afraid of the resistance but rather the uncontrolled flow of weapons coming at us without organization
270864 we want the army to make a decisive decision in disallowing people to possess arms
270865 we believe the unity of the army represents the unity of the country
270866 this is why the salvation of the country resides in the armys unanimity
270867 we reject chaos even if it is just and ask for dictatorship if it will preserve the peoples security and future
270868 we hope emigrants will also have the chance to participate effectively in running the countrys national affairs
270869 we have made our position abundantly clear to the israelis and indeed to the world not just in our public statements but in our private conversations as well
270870 there is uniformity across the us government about the way to proceed with iran
270871 everyone from this white house including the vice presidents office is in agreement that the military option is not the best option at this point and we should pursue diplomatic and economic pressures
270872 an american commitment to deterrence especially if seen by israelis as a substitute for prevention is itself likely to spur israel to consider independent action
270873 i just wanted to show through visuals how bipolar this place is
270874 i also wanted to show how kids grow up with the lingering ghosts of war even when they have not witnessed it themselves
270875 it was a less tragic approach to war as people were still able to sway to the music drink and talk without taking their eyes off the screen
270876 i think the show is brilliant because it denies people the escapism of a friday night
270877 the music and images are powerful reminders of our situation in this country
270878 i hope people were left with a bitter sweet impression and a sense of acknowledgement as opposed to denial and evasiveness
270879 the required reforms in the nssf would lead to a drop of 15 percent in the health bill reduce paper work and improve public services
270880 there is a mounting deficit in the sickness and maternity departments as well as family compensations and all these losses are due to overblown expenditures and unsteady revenues
270881 there is a problem in managing the liquidity in the fund because the cash went primarily to health services
270882 the sickness and maternity departments would have continued to record losses even if the government paid all its dues to the fund
270883 do not hesitate to curb violators no matter what their affiliations are
270884 isnt it a duty to confront anyone who shoots at his compatriot
270885 lebanon suffered a great deal to fight terror and it needs its armys sacrifices
270886 your duty goes beyond politics and confessions maintaining security is your duty and this requires sacrifices
270887 were still waiting for the arabs to announce their contribution
270888 this is still not very clear until now as far as the gulf states are concerned
270889 its not only about money that we have in hand
270890 we really hope that the pledges will be announced and made public soon so that we feel we can start we hope to start by the end of the year at least
270891 once the rubble is removed then they can start building section after section
270892 we have to at least show the whole world and particularly the palestinians that the camp is going to be rebuilt
270893 we got up early for prayers and i went down for a wash
270894 five minutes later a strong gas smell filled the dormitories followed by a deafening blast
270895 stands as the most credible national security institution in the country despite its shortcomings
270896 safeguarding the armys national accomplishments the resistance and the people
270897 has pledged clearly that progress will continue toward establishing the tribunal
270898 this means that at the end of the year the investigator will assume his new position as prosecutor for the international court
270899 i believe that he now has something that will enable him to proceed to assume the position of prosecutor
270900 in order to reduce expenses and also to protect their lives
270901 we created a real cell to organize the mobs and to plan how to liberate my father
270902 its an old building which was not used for a long time
270903 it needs to be renovated to support the structure of the building
270904 fatah commander talal asmar better known as jordanian talal suffered wounds after a bomb placed under his car exploded
270905 resolving instability in ain al hilweh requires the unification of all palestinian and lebanese efforts particularly those of the army and security forces
270906 we hope to reach a solution that preserves the security of camps and ensures our right to return to our homeland
270907 but such a meeting is not expected to be held before next week as fatah leaders will leave lebanon on friday for jordan
270908 all that is being said about transporting weapons into ain al hilweh and lists of assassinations is nothing but rumors
270909 but the camps situation cannot be separated from that of lebanon
270910 must be freed at once it is unacceptable that us troops arrest a journalist and hold him on security grounds
270911 he has been assessed to be a threat to the security of iraq and coalition forces
270912 if its not saturday but next week well not make a big fuss about it what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the very coming days
270913 we are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure if dialogue does not work we could continue with additional pressure at the un or eu level
270914 beyond the tangible benefits of providing high quality specialized training this project also managed to create an extraordinary laboratory of dialogue in which students from different regional and confessional backgrounds lived and studied together for several weeks the perfect integration which the students achieved with their new italian friends further demonstrates the strong bonds between our two countries and this initiative serves as a renewed reminder of our commitment to peace and dialogue
270915 the of italian government has been consistently contributing to the post war reconstruction of lebanon
270916 at the stockholm donors conference of august 2006 italy contributed 30 million euros approximately 48 million which later coupled with a further 120 million euros pledged at the paris iii conference
270917 along with ordinary development assistance and soft loans italys overall developmental assistance to lebanon tops 215 million euros in multi year programs
270918 i dont believe there are many chances that a government led by kadima can be formed as the political world has entered such a zone of turbulence that it will be difficult to restore calm
270919 senate passage of this compact will help us protect the great lakes from water diversions and preserve this invaluable resource for future generations
270920 by passing and enacting the great lakes compact and keeping control of the lakes in the hands of the states that surround them and value them the most
270921 will protect the health of these precious bodies of freshwater preventing unnecessary and dangerous diversions of great lakes waters i know the people of wisconsin feel strongly about the importance of preserving the lakes for future generations
270922 would preserve and protect one of our national treasures for us and future generations
270923 its time to seal the deal and protect our lakes our drinking water our economy and our way of life
270924 nick and the rest of the reviewers did not even review the level editor or the updated controls so this is kinda personal and highly unprofessional im not even going to debate on this because im releasing a demo on monday and people are quite happy with the game so i suggest the buyers to talk about it
270925 to be honest i dont think to this day i will ever in my life do an interview with her
270926 it really affected me and solheim wasnt a time to talk about it
270927 dottie was a family member to me and i dont even see her as a friend any more
270928 i think that it was a really low blow and highly disappointing really because i think that as a golfer you appreciate golf and what we are doing out here it really affected us in our hearts sherri and i thought it was ridiculous really
270929 it was more of a heart thing than anything else we had a team that was there to support us and pull us out of it i dont think sherri or i will ever look at dottie the same
270930 the way laura has chosen to handle the situation publicly is really disappointing
270931 i hope her heart will at some point recognize the comment was not personal highly emotional and certainly never meant to be heard over the air i have made myself available to her but she has chosen not to talk scream at me or whatever else she feels she needs to do for her peace of mind
270932 het probleem is niet dat er geen professionals in de regio zijn maar dat ze geconcentreerd zijn in de steden
270933 en vaak willen vrouwen geen mannelijke arts bij de bevalling
270934 zelfs kleine gezondheidsposten in hutten hebben de benodigde middelen om dat probleem aan te pakken medicijnen een infuus met oestrogeen en andere middelen maar de behandeling moet binnen twee uur beginnen
270935 dan wordt ze op het laatste nippertje alsnog naar het ziekenhuis gebracht maar dan is het vaak te laat
270936 wat we vooral nodig hebben is bewustwording van veiligheid tijdens de zwangerschap
270937 die accepteren dat anticonceptie en mannelijke gynaecologen niet in strijd zijn met de leer van de islam
270938 de regering hier heeft genoeg maar de politieke wil ontbreekt
270939 het is van groot belang dat alle mogelijke partijen ter wereld bij elkaar komen om over de problematiek te praten
270940 het is niet de bedoeling dat er een concreet pakket maatregelen ligt na de conferentie dit is het moment dat het voorwerk daarvoor wordt gedaan en daar moet iedereen aan deelnemen
270941 het stimuleert debat en discussie mensen die in het veld werken doen een heleboel kennis op en het zorgt ervoor dat de aandacht van het publiek voor deze kwestie vastgehouden wordt
270942 het is geen kwestie van eenmalig medicijnen verstrekken pati nten hebben langdurige begeleiding nodig daar moet politieke aandacht voor blijven en donormoeheid moet worden bestreden
270943 a friend just called me to say your save the date card is a little like reading the catcher in the rye
270944 ik ben bezorgd over zijn uitspraak dat het allemaal heel snel zal gaan en ik vraag mij af hoe de hoofdaanklager dit weet en of hij achter de rug van de verdediging een deal heeft gemaakt met de strafkamer
270945 dit is een oude bewering waarmee karadzic al in 1996 begon
270946 zon deal zou immoreel en onethisch zijn natuurlijk is het niet gebeurd
270947 i like my chances it was very hard with the wind today but i played well and im feeling very good for the weekend
270948 its disappointing because i wanted to come here and enjoy it and not be worried about playing at the weekend
270949 but i seem to have struggled ever since i made the announcement in may that i would be stepping away from the tour at the end of the season its always the same story i play 15 good holes and the others cost me too much
270950 but today i just kept grinding and thats the way its been my whole career i just never give up
270951 people who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster
270952 12 minutes ago 0 1 it was a rediculous fall still not as bad as jake brown last year who also was back again last night i was amazed to see danny come back and do another run
270953 islam strictly prohibits harming non combative citizens women and children
270954 islam strictly prohibits harming non combative citizens women and children
270955 to prevent this from happening he took his collection to canada and sold it to the provincial museum of alberta for 1 million
270956 they beat him to the ground and then the evidence that we have when he was on the ground they used their feet on him they were kicking him in the face when he was down
270957 even after surgery there is a strong possibility the victims right eye will not look like his other eye and movement will be limited
270958 federal district court judge kollar kotelly upholds important fec regulations restricting soft money in federal campaigns
270959 we wont be looking at getting in the early breaks unless theyre 15 or 20 strong and looking really dangerous the best policy at san sebastian is always to wait for the jaizkebel climb close to the finish
270960 theres invariably a move early on but the spanish teams always calculate it so things come back together for jaizkebel so thats where we will plan to try and make our move
270961 weve got a lot of good climbers in our line up here for san sebastian which is what you need for a really hilly race like the cl sica
270962 its important for him to keep building up his confidence after such a long time away from racing saxony was a great start and san sebastian is the next opportunity for linus to move up another step
270963 kanstantsin siutzou did a good tour and san sebastian is a great chance for him to use that form for an individual result
270964 he edvald boasson hagen and michael barry will be doing the olympics
270965 so in that context san sebastian also represents an opportunity for them to shake off the cobwebs and have a good full on test out of their form before they head off to represent their country at beijing
270966 i happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet
270967 the ufo phenomenon is real although its been covered up by our governments for a long time
270968 i have been deeply involved in certain committees and certain research circles with very credible scientists and intelligence people that do know the inside story
270969 some of them are these little people that look strange to us
270970 its pretty obvious that if it were hostile wed have been gone by now

270973 i love the sun so i do get different pigmentation
270974 the first time i went i was like wow what an improvement
270975 patients with poor skin textures patients with pigment abnormalities patients with fine lesions bumps and lumps on the skin
270976 that opens the pores and then cleanses the pores all kind of the same motion
270977 the nice thing about the system is that theres really no down time
270978 i just go from here back to my office and from here meet clients and i dont have to worry about being red
270979 barack obama created the heavens and the earth but can he lead

270981 i happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet
270982 the ufo phenomenon is real although its been covered up by our governments for a long time
270983 i have been deeply involved in certain committees and certain research circles with very credible scientists and intelligence people that do know the inside story
270984 some of them are these little people that look strange to us
270985 its pretty obvious that if it were hostile wed have been gone by now
270986 hes a public figure and hes making statements and they need to be responsibly examined
270987 i cant conceive of this government in a free country withholding information that hes alluding to
270988 poor schooling from overwhelmed teachers plagued by badly designed programs
270989 even in texas one of the reddest states in the country people are fed up
270990 combine this desire for change with the strong campaigns both michael skelly and larry joe doherty are running and it offers democrats unique opportunities in texas this year
270991 but the environment requires us to work harder and earlier than we normally would because theres a lot of uncertainty in the air
270992 in a presidential year with john mccain at the top of the ticket the 7th and 10th districts are even further out of reach for the democrats
270993 even in texas one of the reddest states in the country people are fed up
270994 combine this desire for change with the strong campaigns both michael skelly and larry joe doherty are running and it offers democrats unique opportunities in texas this year
270995 i always expect to be outspent when facing a multimillionaire like this
270996 this is the perfect year and the perfect district for a successful wind energy businessman who has spent his career working on the issues that people care about most
270997 when you step back and look at the polling fundraising and election ratings this district is clearly ready for larry joe dohertys leadership
270998 both rep mccaul and rep culberson are entrenched in the district and have records that will get them re elected in november
270999 we can continue to be an energy leader in this new energy economy but we have to have the leadership and the vision to make that happen
271000 in our plan we have said that we are in favor of additional off shore drilling we are accustomed to it as texans thats what we have done for a long time as part of our economy
271001 but he has received in excess of a million and change in political contributions from the big oil companines now and during his political career
271002 you can no longer put the special interests above texas familys interest
271003 how many folks do you have on staff right now who could possibly be an ubersuit or a c agency ideator
271004 he will not appear on the landscape as a csi to begin with
271005 hes a professor with background in pathology he will appear when grissom is investigating what will be a two part case he will help grissom and the team bring the perpetrator to justice and then this character will stay around and ultimately become a csi

271011 the man required round the clock assistance a condition he wanted to change as quickly as possible
271012 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
271013 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
271014 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
271015 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
271016 at this time im not aware of what may have provoked this attack
271017 i can confirm the victim was stabbed and that the victim was pronounced dead at the scene
271018 this is one of the most horrific crimes i have ever heard in my life

271043 a mini subscription priced at 4 a month this would let users stream more music than they can for free last fms current deal limits users to 3 plays per song per month but would be capped at some number weve heard 100 songs a month but that seems too tiny to entice many users an all you can eat unlimited subscription priced at 10 a month

271045 for us its all about making sports easier to understand says david neal nbcs executive vice president in charge of olympics coverage
271046 but the best technical innovations are the ones that take the viewer on a magic carpet ride they transport the television viewer out of their easy chair at home and give them a sense of what its like to be on the field of play
271047 i remember as a kid watching and saying wow how do they do that the olympics were always the showcases for all of the newest technology roone set the gold standard
271048 we were trying to figure out how you can capture the madness of someone getting on a 10 meter platform and actually thinking that its a good idea to dive off that thing three stories up and go into the water he recalls
271049 garretts sort of like the doc brown character in the back to the future movies neal says
271050 you see these unusual botticelli like images of the swimmers brown says
271051 these systems allow the viewer to see sights that have not been seen before that are just ravishing
271052 its like youre in your own little airplane flying along with these guys giving you a sense of their power and speed brown says
271053 instead of describing the course verbally well use this mapping technology something which today is instantly recognizable by consumers to give a clear picture
271054 theres a camera embedded in the weightlifting platform shooting up through glass to give you a bottoms up look at a weightlifter neal says
271055 our mantra here is storytelling we not only want to demystify a sport for the american audience but we want to engage our audience in these sports he says
271056 we can use the technology to make the sport easily understood
271057 the first trademark application was made in 1998 under serial number 75291765 by netcentric corporation a company that used to provide
271058 we dont know why it got lost but once it did it chose to strand because it was sick
271059 i went quite far im sorry i didnt go farther but you know what can you do america has spoken no canadians were allowed to vote
271060 i wish canadians wouldve been able to vote because i have a lot of support here it couldve helped me out quite a bit but you know thats the rule
271061 voting is open to all persons located in the 50 united states the district of columbia and puerto rico
271062 in the end its been a really great thing and ive met a lot of amazing people
271063 i think its brought my comedy to a lot more people and hopefully ill be able to capitalize on that in america
271064 thats only in canada that people would kind of question if its fair that im involved
271065 its the only place anybody ever asked me why are you doing this arent you already doing well and im like well doing well in canada as a performer monetarily its not enormously lucrative and its a small market
271066 were a conservative community and were just trying to make our students more reflective of that
271067 it is an additional option to allow us to keep kids in the educational classroom
271068 i dont think that jumpsuits are going to work because my friends actually instead of it being a punishment theyll see it as an opportunity to be like rebels
271069 i dont think theres going to be enough jumpsuits for everyone in the school
271070 by calling work coveralls a prison outfit i think is rather insulting to all those people that work out in the economy every day in some kind of business that requires them because of the nature of their work to wear a coverall
271071 public school dress codes should be limited to whats necessary to guard against actual disruption to the educational process and threats to safety
271072 the jumpsuits may be just as distracting as the clothing theyre replacing
271073 i dont think that it was racially motivated but i think there are racial overtones to what did happen
271074 i think the incident started with a mistaken identity situation but i think that once it escalated to the point of the beating that there will be racial overtones that come forward remarks that were made insults language that would be racially inflammatory
271075 i just think its so totally out of character for anything like that to have happened here i just could not believe it was true
271076 those actions were so not in keeping with what were known for here
271077 these things do happen bizarre things happen everywhere i think the biggest thing is just the feeling of sadness that that happened to someone
271078 you can find whatever you want in town drugs you name it theyre here
271079 any of these guys who say theres nothing wrong with owen sound theyre crazy or they just dont see it
271080 im realistic enough to know that an incident like this is going to give some people pause but i think that for the most part the people in this community will understand that this is absolutely an unusual incident and not the type of thing that happens on a regular basis in owen sound
271081 what would be very upsetting is that these young hooligans will have changed that for the community and theres no way that they should be allowed that kind of power
271082 some problems persist with how individual policy measures are calculated and with their projected emission reductions
271083 individual policy measures continue to be presented without these sources of overestimation adequately being taken into account
271084 the modelling that the government of canada uses is just that modelling it changes year by year depending on the different data that we get
271085 if the cap is not a real hard cap but is an intensity cap so that it depends on growth rates of different sectors then you have to speculate on it
271086 we thought it was on the optimistic side in terms of how much reductions would actually happen
271087 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
271088 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
271089 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
271090 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
271091 it doesnt jive with anything about the bruce that was my neighbour
271092 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets

271098 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
271099 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
271100 my own take on all the available reports is that they suggest a problem to be concerned about
271101 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
271102 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
271103 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
271104 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
271105 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
271106 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
271107 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin
271108 i would likely have brought the case in for autopsy

271124 darwin gives us a far more empirical way of talking about human nature than through stories like the original sin
271125 it explains our frailties our addictions our infidelities and other moral deficiencies as byproducts of adaptation over billions of years and that dowd says has a potentially liberating effect never mind guilt once we understand our sinful ways we can get past them and play a conscious role in the evolution of humanity

271177 as christians we often thank god that jesus bore our sins in his body on the tree we need to remember something else in his full identification with our humanity and especially on that cross he took unto himself the entire range of our feelings and he bore the feeling of our infirmities that we would not have to bear them alone
271178 mainly due to relative deterioration of the political and regulatory environment

271203 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
271204 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
271205 we are also doing an investigation with the state highway patrol about what happened

271209 september 11 has become the catch all excuse for virtually every proposed expansion of government power

271211 consumers deserve to know that the commitment to stop arbitrary blocking is backed up by legal enforcement
271212 we believe that the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
271213 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
271214 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
271215 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
271216 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
271217 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
271218 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
271219 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
271220 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
271221 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
271222 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
271223 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
271224 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
271225 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
271226 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
271227 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
271228 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
271229 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
271230 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

271238 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
271239 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
271240 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
271241 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
271242 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
271243 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
271244 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
271245 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
271246 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
271247 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
271248 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
271249 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
271250 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
271251 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
271252 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
271253 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
271254 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
271255 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
271256 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
271257 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
271258 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
271259 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
271260 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
271261 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
271262 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
271263 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
271264 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
271265 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
271266 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
271267 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
271268 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
271269 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
271270 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
271271 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we

271274 i think that whenever you have layoffs and you do that it will have an impact in the private sector we read every day stories where companies have to lay off that means there is less productivity there so we have to tighten our belt everyone has to tighten our belt
271275 if gov arnold schwarzeneggers intent was to rile up the state work force and put pressure on lawmakers to strike a budget deal he couldnt have scripted it better
271276 state leaders need to understand that borrowing their way out of a financial hole or transferring the state deficit to local government doesnt address the real problem and is downright irresponsible it also fails the true test of leadership to leave the state or your city better off than when you arrived
271277 economic growth and an educated work force are both tied directly to the work of our states three systems of public higher education the california community colleges the california state university system and the university of california system not only expand opportunity for the students they enroll the three systems contribute to the economy health and quality of life for every californian

271283 if were going to promote wind energy in california every turbine counts
271284 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
271285 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
271286 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
271287 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
271288 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
271289 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
271290 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
271291 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
271292 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
271293 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
271294 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
271295 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
271296 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
271297 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
271298 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
271299 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
271300 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
271301 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
271302 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
271303 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
271304 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
271305 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
271306 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
271307 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
271308 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
271309 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
271310 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
271311 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
271312 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
271313 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
271314 who are open to doing something on the production side
271315 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
271316 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
271317 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
271318 dont throw it out recycle renew and reuse to make things last
271319 it makes sense for all of us to be more careful about how we spend money
271320 if theres ever a question of safety involved in reusing an object id say dont do it
271321 it was something that cost us but with three families going in it wasnt a big strain
271322 we have families who buy together friends who buy together
271323 the benefits are that you share the expenses and the cost
271324 one drawback is that you have to share the house too
271325 its a place to go and relax and hang out and not fuss about things
271326 the cabin wouldnt be used as much as it should be used if it was just us
271327 we made a very conscious decision to ditch the whole potomac lifestyle
271328 as soon as you cross over the bay bridge suddenly all of your worries dissipate
271329 living in the city was stressful everyone is so competitive and we just felt like it was all just too much and we wanted a better more relaxed environment for our kids
271330 becomes part of you after a while i can come home from work take the boat out fishing for an hour or so bring home some rockfish for dinner then have a cocktail out back and watch the sun set whats not to like
271331 i also use a lot of textured and patterned rugs because i live with dirty boys and a dirty husband coming in and out of the house i needed something that would distract the eye from all that mess
271332 everything was either dark brick or dark grungy knotty pine which is so not me
271333 a major overhaul since every tile is either baby aspirin pink or some yucky blue
271334 im not super frilly but i do like a light touch i have a uniform when i dress solid colored pants with something soft to give it flair and its the same philosophy i guess
271335 i love looking out onto the soft blue water and the greenness of the grass going down to the slip
271336 i even managed to bring some of that into the boys rooms which was a challenge
271337 but i managed to find the one fabric in the world that had those colors and dragons as well
271338 but this house has been great for our family theres a tranquility out here thats tough to beat its pretty much perfect
271339 either you dont have enough or you have too much
271340 you want the water moving away from the house not toward it
271341 is the house at a low point in the overall block if so youre likely to be the pond
271342 that would be considered personal property it would go away
271343 after the survey results i guess im surprised that more accidents dont happen its amazing how so few of us think about being burned by our tap water
271344 one way to reduce the risk is to simply adjust the thermostat on your water heater
271345 most heaters have adjustable thermostats and dialing it down to 120 degrees can prevent some of these accidents
271346 unfortunately we are not giving consumers the answers they want
271347 we think its a better measurement of a mowers ability to cut grass
271348 and its more complicated for us because its almost impossible to try and explain what gross torque means
271349 many people think of this as a trivial pursuit simply a matter of flipping a switch
271350 but you just cant do that in most applications you have to build awareness good lighting is a big help because bad lighting is the problem
271351 not necessarily turned off but lights redirected downward so they dont intrude into secluded zones or residential areas
271352 its more a matter of attitude than mechanics its finally deciding that you dont want to infringe upon another persons nighttime privacy or into quiet corners
271353 the milky way often is the measuring stick for dark sky watchers
271354 if you go to an atlas and take it from the midwest to the east coast there are few places the size of a county that have unpolluted dark skies here in the west there are only a couple of good areas where you can see and feel the darkness but theyre hard to get to
271355 it really wouldnt take a lot of money to solve this
271356 most people who have changed their lighting systems have saved money in the process
271357 i was upset about streetlights shining into my second floor bedroom windows
271358 ive been working with a variety of scientists and policymakers for a couple of years to help fight it
271359 we try to manage light as you would any pollution emission
271360 twenty seven states currently have laws or proposed laws for energy lighting or eliminating upward directed lights
271361 that kind of lighting blinds good people and bad people alike two thirds of all property crime occurs during the day and as far as im concerned the need for security lighting is a myth it gets to where the cities have to pay for their streetlights rather than hire more officers to patrol the streets
271362 theres a whole generation of children growing up a large fraction of whom have never seen the stars
271363 light pollution is like having thick air pollution that would only let you see a quarter of the way across the
271364 brings the spaces of the house into harmony with each other
271365 i always wanted to have a house where our kids and their friends would hang out
271366 its just a small little room but theyre very happy here
271367 he doesnt like my neighborhood as much but he likes my house because it has a half pipe in my back yard
271368 so he comes over with his friends its not fancy but its fun
271369 im no fan of acrylic but it has its place
271370 i think what lyn is doing is great i know first hand how tough it is for women races to get any recognition for their accomplishments
271371 even with all of the success i have had i have a very hard time getting sponsors and race teams to give me a second look my favorite thing to say is if it is a male dominated sport why am i always dominating
271372 i want to beat him schumacher so bad maybe i try a little too hard
271373 i cant think of a more appropriate place to announce an education initiative than at the lulac convention whose president rosa rosales continues to uphold education as a primary focus
271374 i am very passionate about education and i want to do everything that i can to inspire young people to study hard and aim for the stars
271375 milka duno is an outstanding individual and a role model who can help bring attention to the need for mentoring and educational achievement in the areas of science technology engineering and mathematics among hispanic youth mana is pleased to continue to bring innovative educational programming to the hispanic community through this initiative and is exceedingly proud to partner with milka duno wal mart stores inc state farm insurance companies and southwest airlines all of whom continue to work tirelessly for the betterment of youth
271376 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
271377 he has a lot of friends and they are all very upset hes gone and they would like to say they miss him and he will always be in their hearts
271378 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
271379 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivinss case it led to his untimely death
271380 a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
271381 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations

271400 this bill will provide an important alternative to the way doctors currently get their information about drugs from the drug companies themselves
271401 by providing physicians with thorough independent research on all the drugs available to them we believe we can improve the quality of healthcare and reduce the cost of prescription drugs in america
271402 for far too long most of the information physicians receive to make prescribing decisions has come from the drug companies marketing reps not independent experts
271403 this important legislation will go a long way toward giving doctors another less biased perspective
271404 we need a program like this to counter the pharmaceutical industrys marketing free for all

271407 following discussions the ioc held with bocog and chinese authorities regarding difficulties experienced this week in accessing some websites the ioc is pleased to see that the issues are being quickly resolved
271408 the media should be seeing a noticeable difference in accessibility to websites that they need to report on the olympic games
271409 some sites are blocked under chinese law but i do not have further information on which
271410 we welcome the news today that the authorities have lifted blocks on our website in the olympics media venues and possibly elsewhere in beijing
271411 however arbitrary blocking and unblocking of certain sites does not fulfil the duty to comply with international standards of freedom of information and expression
271412 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
271413 while we realize the possibility of reporters being able to enter these camps is slim their ability to remember and give voice to innocent falun gong adherents and other civil rights defenders who suffer torture and death only miles from where athletes celebrate victory is not
271414 giving them a voice is not only our duty as responsible global citizens it is also the true realization of the olympic spirit

271419 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
271420 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
271421 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
271422 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric

271515 theory tells us that jump height should not fall in proportion to body size as animals get smaller fleas are actually rather poor jumpers
271516 i have told my zoology class that we should put a speedo logo on the side of an albacore in the olympics and have it race
271517 im amazed at how pathetic human swimmers are compared to other animals

271519 we are pleased to have been able to come to an agreement with both kinross and hecla to acquire 100 of the property the golden eagle property offers a very attractive underground high grade vein exploration target on private ground we believe that exploring under the historic two million ounce hot springs system is an attractive place to find more high grade gold this target is adjacent to the republic knob hill veins which produced high grade gold for hecla for over 20 years we will also review options to process sulfide mineralization in view of newer technologies and the economics afforded by a higher gold price the ability to explore the deeper targets combined with the strategic access to kinross nearby mill is a bonus that could add value to any new oxide ounces discovered on the property

271523 they had great technique great effort and defensively they were much better than the world championship team of two years ago and they are definitely in better shape than they were two years ago and they use a team system not a star system

271526 in c level positions those positions in a company with titles that start with chief business often dictates that you have management human resource finance and marketing related courses these are areas in which you likely would have functional oversight an mba would help you develop a fundamental understanding of these areas that you would not receive from a single focused degree

271531 consumers were happy to embrace standard dvd when that format arrived because the improvement in quality over vhs videotapes was dramatic standard dvd didnt require the purchase of a new tv either in contrast while half of the respondents to our survey rated quality as much better than standard dvd another 40 termed it only somewhat better and most are very satisfied with the performance of their current dvd players
271532 we expect that player prices will remain above 300 for tier one models for the remainder of this year

271536 i listen to a lot of western musicians because they are not afraid to show their individuality they express themselves openly and publicly particularly contemporary western music but i also like asian music for its subtlety
271537 i like bjorks music very much i think that when a new concept emerges people will make comparisons with something already out there and im ok with that the most important thing is that as time passes people see sa dingdings performances then they can understand sa dingdings music better

271540 i know you dallas cowboy fans are probably freaking out seeing jessica simpson show up to tony romos training camp and you should be because those big tits are going to cost you the season dont believe me those tits have cost me relationships just ask my ex girlfriends who keep dumping my ass when i keep yelling her name out during sex anyway enjoy the season suckas
271541 rihanna left boyfriend chirs brown i have no idea who that is at home last night while she hit the clubs in nyc in a kick ass see thru top
271542 rihanna looks like a visitor from outer space sent to study us in preparation for the inevitable attack and colonization so its really no surprise that she looks even weirder without a bra her areolas look like theyre infected
271543 sophie monk is a shitty actress with an even shittier resume of box office failures but i doubt youll care because her bikini is virtually see through when its wet and if theres one thing ive learned about this industry its that you can be a boil on the ass of all things thespian and still get a job if youre blond and have big tits that goes double if you have a will do full frontal clause in your contract and dont mind sucking a little director dick from time to time on the other hand those qualifications only hinder your chances for a job if youre looking for a part time position at a daycare or old folks home just trust me on that one
271544 clearly kristin cavallari is never going to be anything other than a reality tv star if she keeps up this prudish behavior ruining some perfectly good pictures by wearing a bra under a thin see through t shirt come on you know better than that if youre going to make it in this business youve got to show a little something give us a taste a nipple slip an upskirt something

271548 the holy father spends his days in prayer rest study and playing the piano
271549 only his walks in the garden and the piano interrupt his intellectual activities
271550 the reason men dont like her is because she dresses for herself rather than for them
271551 we can laud her all we want call her best dressed make carrie bradshaw our role model men just arent into her
271552 are you threatened by the fact that women find her attractive
271553 because shes obviously ugly she looks like she was in a bar fight
271554 western culture is hellish when it persuades men that the sole aim of life is pleasure and self interest today more than ever the christian must be aware that he belongs to a minority and that he is in opposition to everything that appears good obvious logical to the spirit of the world as the new testament calls it it is time to find again the courage of non conformism the capacity to oppose many of the trends of the surrounding culture renouncing a certain euphoric post conciliar solidarity
271555 if by restoration we understand the search for a new balance after the overly positive interpretations of an agnostic and atheistic world then a restoration understood in this sense a newly found balance of orientation and values within the catholic totality is altogether desirable and for that matter is already in operation in the church
271556 what the popes and the council fathers were expecting was a new catholic unity and instead one has encountered a dissension which to use the words of paul vi seems to have passed over from self criticism to self destruction there had been the expectation of a step forward and instead one found oneself facing a progressive process of decadence that to a large measure has been unfolding under the sign of a summons to a presumed spirit of the council and by so doing has actually and increasingly discredited it
271557 the absolute good and this means the building of a just socialistic society becomes the moral norm that justifies everything else including if necessary violence homicide mendacity and what looks like liberation turns into its opposite and shows its diabolic visage in deeds
271558 in many episcopal conferences the group spirit and perhaps even the wish for a quiet peaceful life or conformism lead the majority to accept the positions of active minorities bent upon pursuing clear goals
271559 every theologian now seems to want to be creative but his proper task is to deepen the common deposit of the faith as well as to help in understanding and proclaiming it not to create it
271560 the church of christ is not a party not an association not a club her deep and permanent structure is not democratic but sacramental consequently hierarchical
271561 what radical feminism at times even that which asserts that it is based on christianity is not prepared to accept is precisely the exemplary universal unchangeable relationship between christ and the father i am in fact convinced that what feminism promotes in its radical form is no longer the christianity that we know it is another religion
271562 those who like ratzinger exalt themselves in such a triumphalistic manner above everything exclude themselves as dialogue partners
271563 were having a synod around a council not a book
271564 ratzinger is right in what he has written in the book
271565 but he is not right in what he has not written
271566 the only really effective apologia for christianity comes down to two arguments namely the saints the church has produced and the art which has grown in her womb
271567 a theologian who does not love art poetry music and nature can be dangerous blindness and deafness toward the beautiful are not incidental they necessarily are reflected in his theology
271568 salvation for the church comes from within her but this in no way means to say that it comes from the decrees of the hierarchy

271579 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
271580 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
271581 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

271583 the five states with least favorable business climates are califorinia lowest ranking new york michigan new jersey and massachusetts
271584 massachusetts was the only state to have failed to post any gain in its pool of employed residents
271585 abortion decline in us leads to long term reduction in infant mortality rates
271586 on the one hand it is so unexpected to find such a fragile bulla in such harsh conditions of excavation while on the other hand it was logical to find precisely here the bulla of gedalyahu ben pashur only meters away from the place where we found the bulla of yehukhal ben shelemyahu since these two ministers are mentioned side by side in the bible as having served together in the kingdom of king zedekiah
271587 it is not very often that such a discovery happens in which real figures of the past shake off the dust of history and so vividly revive the stories of the bible
271588 wanted to know where the good press coverage was coming from
271589 and it came to pass that as i nephi went forth to slay food behold i did break my bow which was made of fine steel and after i did break my bow behold my brethren were angry with me because of the loss of my bow for we did obtain no food
271590 and i hope that the environazis dont find some reason to object to this piece of history being on the road again
271591 yes yes yes yes yes yes oh oh oh oh oh oh huh
271592 we dont see why welcoming the gay or lesbian person with love must mean blessing what they do in the churchs name or accepting them for ordination whatever their lifestyle we seek to love them and all right we dont always make a good job of it but we cant just say that there is nothing to challenge
271593 we know that no one is the best judge in their own case but we see in our church life at least some marks of the spirits gifts and part of that is acknowledging the gifts weve seen in gay and lesbian believers
271594 it didnt happen and each group was content to blame the other but the last 18 months dont suggest that this was a good outcome can this conference now put the same kind of challenge at the moment we seem often to be threatening death to each other not offering life we need to speak life to each other and that means change
271595 well were going to get off the air here very shortly because we have the story told now

271597 when we were looking at publishers there were only a handful and we were really excited by the leadership john riccitiello flew to mesquite to talk to us and he is more of a gamer than i think people realise
271598 the questions that he asked and frank gibeau david demartini those guys run the most powerful publisher in the world and theyre all hardcore games they were excited about the title and we felt that ea would be the best partner for us and it wasnt about money
271599 and regardless of whether your organisations 100 people or 5000 people

271647 doing journalism at its most basic level is a combination of two essential tasks the first is reporting gathering information via research interviews etc the second part is telling your audience what youve learned writing in the broadest sense including video audio graphics and more and editing the demolition of the professional journalism business model has led to a sharp decline one i dont see slowing anytime soon in traditional media many people in the field have been asking an obvious question with a not so obvious answer who will do the serious journalism we need in the future

271649 not to put too fine a point on it the chinese government has double crossed the international olympic committee
271650 i start from a presumption of liberty think of the founders of our nation they assembled as people who had the liberty to create a government they knew that historically all governments reflect their own self interest and come over time to limit if not destroy the collective power of the people they believed that a government built of checks and balances would ensure protection of their and our liberty into the future one method for doing this was to provide that the government must present its case for taking away a citizens liberty to a jury of peers and that the jury must unanimously agree to a general verdict of guilt as warrant for the state to take his liberty the jury will endure as a bulwark so long as it decides the whole case the law and the fact when all other balances fail the jury will remain as the last protection of liberty

271671 there are more people here in america dying more of crime than there is in the war of iraq
271672 some of those tactics very frankly you mentioned the war in iraq are somewhat like that we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement

271727 its time to seal the deal and protect our lakes our drinking water our economy and our way of life
271728 nu pot sa inteleg de ce se spune ca seman cu andreea marin comparatia este onorabila insa nu i am furat stilul iar argumentul meu este ca nu m am uitat niciodata la emisiunea ei
271729 doctorii m au avertizat ca trebuie sa slabesc cel putin 20 de kilograme in urmatoarele doua luni altfel voi muri apoi dupa ce dau jos cele 20 de kilograme trebuie sa tin un regim foarte strict pentru a deveni un copil normal insa nu pot renunta la mancare este ca un drog unii aleg heroina iar eu am recurs la mancare care acum ma poate ucide de cand am depasit 150 de kilograme am fost diagnosticata si cu doua forme de diabet
271730 atunci cand tatal meu a murit de emfizem pulmonar am inceput sa mananc foarte multa paine cartofi prajiti spaghete prajituri cu ciocolata si sa beau foarte multa coca cola pe zi gandindu ma ca asa pot trece peste suferinta provocata de moartea lui
271731 am fost chiar data afara de la cantina scolii unde invatam tocmai pentru ca mancam exagerat de mult sunt o ciudata din cauza apetitului meu si a obezitatii mele dar nu pot face absolut nimic sa slabesc
271732 sunt convinsa ca politistul a fost inteles cu paparazzii de la cancan

271742 este o foarte buna profesionista a dansului la bara si toate miscarile ei te lasa cu gura cascata
271743 a fost darul pe care mi l doream enorm am vrut sa mi comand singura microfonul sa l cumpar eu deoarece aveam nevoie de unul performant cornel insa mi a interzis s o fac si abia acum cateva zile am inteles de ce voia sa mi l daruiasca de ziua mea

271753 failed throughout to conduct an investigation that would meet the standard of competence to be expected of police officers
271754 a criminal prosecution is a very serious matter especially to a good young man
271755 a minimum of investigation or thought would have shown that the police had identified the wrong
271756 the police had a picture of the man who had presented himself for the paternity test the man in the picture bears no resemblance
271757 este posibil ca la finalul investigatiilor sa nu reusim sa adunam suficiente dovezi pentru a declara cine este vinovat de atrocitatile de la orfelinat si cine sunt cei care si au pierdut viata la casa de copii intrucat nu s a tinut niciodata o evidenta a orfanilor de la

271769 workers really need to stick together were going to be reaching out to sympathetic organizations throughout the country were reaching out to many different labor unions through organizations like jobs with justice theres a lot of people that we have that are ready to support us on saturday night
271770 workers with paid sick days were more likely to go to doctors for preventative care to take time off when sick and to care for their own children when their children were sick we were really struck by the fact that those with the greatest need for paid sick days had the least access california workers in poor health and with chronic diseases like hypertension were less likely to have paid sick days
271771 when people are sick we tend to come into work anyway because we need the money for that shift so i know as a restaurant worker myself i rarely take off sick time

271798 were trying to put something out there that is a valuable offering in the selection and service at a reasonable price point and see how people react
271799 a lot of false speculation is rumbling around about our company and instead of letting other people define us we wanted to define ourselves
271800 i am not pleased with our fourth quarter performance and i know we can do better even in a tough economy this level of profitability is not indicative of what winn dixie can deliver
271801 ultimately the company needs to demonstrate it can drive sales and ebitda
271802 both of these projects appear to have various advantages in terms of quality and proximity to market that could make them very attractive ventures
271803 should i ever need to do something like this will i be able to
271804 to all of our fans we are sad to bring you the news that our upcoming shows in the uk dates below are going to be our last as a band

271813 i know that water pong seems like a good balance between the dartmouth drinking culture and just trying to have fun
271814 however it can be just as dangerous if not more so
271815 foul language rowdy and disorderly behavior and to examples of the consumption of alcohol under circumstances that are detrimental
271816 biggest pet peeve i dont even know what the fuck that means
271817 this year with everything going up inflation we decided wed take advantage of it
271818 the excitement is there because obviously it is tax free

271820 his wife was the only witness that actually saw what happened
271821 when he actually fell and came off the jet he actually responded and said get me some help or something to that effect

271823 we heard pretty loud and clear from customers that they want data one gigabyte per month is fair but its not generous we want customers who scoff at one gigabyte to have the option to get more

271826 when you pick up a two foot eight inch human being and throw him to the floor it hurts
271827 we had an opportunity today which we didnt take which was disappointing weve asked for patience pressure we asked for bowling in partnerships and to bat in partnerships we asked the guys to forget about outcomes and unfortunately we forgot about everything we spoke about
271828 this is a team thats very desperate to win the series
271829 theres a lot of hunger which is not a bad thing its a good thing but the disappointment was tangible in the dressing room
271830 hed almost been written off but he came out today and played unbelievably well under a lot of pressure hats off to colly he played fantastically
271831 but there was a lot of emotional energy shown today and not a huge amount of intelligent energy we ran on emotion and what we saw there were guys who were completely knackered mentally and physically because they had an emotional drain today
271832 and if it works we will be set 250 60 70 and we believe we can get that it is very evenly balanced tonight
271833 they moved him to the place that he should have been in the beginning

271840 the lord determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name
271841 an extremist who has built his empire on the backs of gays and lesbians
271842 and that attracts the medias attention unfortunately hes a little less adept at putting truth into sentences
271843 the focus on the family broadcast was created as and remains a means of helping families thrive
271844 if you were to analyze the content of our 32 years of broadcasts only a minuscule number deal with public policy issues and an infinitesimal number deal with homosexuality
271845 he never said the scientists agreed with his conclusion that gay marriage is bad for society
271846 he merely said their data could be used to reach his conclusion which is 100 percent true but something the scientists didnt appreciate because of their ideological leanings
271847 our only criterion is the number of years in the business
271848 hes been broadcasting more than 15 years on more than 3 000 stations hes qualified
271849 its not everyone today who is willing to stand up and do right in the face of the acidic criticism that comes from activists like wayne besen
271850 i hope those who appreciate all that focus on the family has done will let mr dumont know how much they appreciate his courage
271851 congratulates the focus on the family radio program its staff and its founder and chairman james dobson for their excellence in radio programming and the programs worthy induction into the national radio hall of fame
271852 it recognizes the great work of the thousands of people who have put out the focus on the family broadcast through the years
271853 it is further affirmation that the program has impacted millions of lives for the better that represents the real joy in dr dobsons heart that the lord has used him and his show to help families thrive
271854 the cross is being used for the legitimate secular purpose of honoring veterans and the objective reasonable observer would see it in that context
271855 to have to not pay tax i mean really helps out not a lot but at least you save something
271856 ive bought about three suits and shoes i bought my daughter something
271857 sales have been down but it looks like with this weekend its going to be a shot in the arm as far driving more sales for the retailers and definitely great deals for people coming to the mall

271859 that certainly was an historic moment as the president in waiting emerged from the mens room still drying his hands
271860 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north northwest and central afghanistan
271861 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups

271867 i have pride and i know what im capable of i know im slipping away but in my mind im as good as ive ever been the scores dont reflect that but in my heart and in my head i believe it for me its more about keeping on fighting thats what ive been doing since i came out here and im not going to change anything its all or nothing
271868 this was a year long investigation which accrued a huge amount of evidence the jury deliberated for less than eight hours can they really say they gave due consideration to all the facts
271869 mr george feels overwhelmed by the verdict as throughout the trial he did not dare to get his hopes up and he continually said to me in the dock he believed he would be convicted
271870 i have spent hours and hours with barry george hes always maintained his innocence i would seriously doubt that someone with his level of problems could carry out the murder and i would expect someone who has his problems to let something slip but he never has
271871 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends the investigation was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered
271872 what it shows is that the city of london is not big enough to accommodate the mega banks any more
271873 theres no doubt that false and damaging rumours were circulating about hbos on march 19 2008 and these would have had some impact on hboss share price
271874 it is difficult however to say how much impact as the share price was also affected by the interaction of a number of other complex factors on the day
271875 we are examining what policies are in place and how firms ensure compliance with them whether and how rumours are verified whether traders are permitted to pass on or trade on rumours and how firms ensure staff do not either initiate or spread false rumours
271876 en marzo de 1990 naci un chile diferente con aroma luminoso distinto al que en ese entonces hab amos vivido en ese momento se cerr una etapa de muertos reprimidos y exiliados que abri una nueva en la que empezamos a reconstruir nuestra naci n sin rencor pero con justicia

271878 more sex drugs rock and roll and porn wrapped around a deep emotional core
271879 i was a little surprised at how much women liked it at first but now i meet women all the time who are so into the show
271880 i dont think marcys journey is over one thing i am not supposed to tell you about marcy and season 2 shes going to develop a nasty little cocaine habit
271881 i have seen every episode i cant tell anyone what i am playing i can only say i am not playing myself christ i hope no one thinks its me its quite a character i wouldnt want people thinking hes based on my personality
271882 even after hanging around with these boys for a few days and playing golf with them i found it hard to shake off my whole fan geekiness
271883 they dont normally give up their series actors to appear on any hbo show but i am such a huge fan of the show and they made the exception for me
271884 no idea what is in store for the third season of brotherhood
271885 to be more pissed off and grumpy because of lack of sleep
271886 no one has a good time in brotherhood i think thats why people like watching it because by comparison everyones lives are just peachy
271887 university doesnt sound nearly as fun as single parenthood and maybe one day becomming assistant manager at the mcdonalds
271888 really has done a great job of shining a light on student performance
271889 the bar is set high and will continue to increase but we welcome these challenges
271890 we accept the system and these ratings for 2008 show us where our hard work has paid off and where we need to work harder
271891 we are not going to be willing to let kids flounder in a poor performing environment for long
271892 another piece of evidence that the problems the company faces have no short term fixes and we would continue to avoid the shares
271893 sun continues to restructure and focus on cost cutting which we think will result in improved profitability when demand improves
271894 remain under pressure as suns core fundamentals continue to deteriorate
271895 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the us open you have no idea just to type those words hurt
271896 i think this will be the first grand slam i have ever missed
271897 dadme un punto de conexi n a internet y me mover por el mundo
271898 weve made a bid for kevin davies but bolton have said hes not for sale

271902 recently the congress passed with my support important legislation that expands the education benefits for our returning service members
271903 while i strongly support expanding the current g i bill attaching tax increases on small business owners many of whom are veterans themselves or create jobs for veterans is the wrong way to go
271904 es la primera vez desde que ch vez lleg al poder tras los comicios de diciembre de 1998 en que la oposici n hace el esfuerzo de presentarse unida el proceso no es simple

272075 no ha habido nunca diferencias ni en lo pol tico ni en lo ideol gico que marquen distancia entre nosotros
272076 hemos mantenido y seguimos manteniendo las conversaciones con nuestros aliados de siempre desde el a o 1998 con los cuales en principio no ha habido nunca diferencias ni en lo pol tico ni en lo ideol gico que marquen distancia entre nosotros

272080 por esto se ha generado alg n distanciamiento como en otras oportunidades derivadas del deseo de mantener espacios pol ticos en una situaci n donde posiblemente se ha perdido la expectativa de lo que est ocurriendo a nivel mundial en relaci n con la democracia liberal
272081 las instituciones de esa democracia liberal est n en franco decaimiento y por ello es que ha ocurrido la emergencia de muchos l deres que personalmente conocen y tienen una relaci n directa con el pueblo
272082 casi todos los partidos de ese corte que funcionaban dentro de los mecanismos de la democracia liberal han perdido significado
272083 el gran fen meno que est ocurriendo en el mundo es la tendencia a la abstenci n pol tica porque el ciudadano com n no se siente representado realmente en los debates que se realizan en las c pulas pol ticas

272089 one of the things that i come to in my limited contributions to the whole doom 4 design process is it has to still be you beating down the bad guys
272090 it has to be a triumph of heavy weaponry over demonic forces in some way and you have to be blowing demons all to hell all around you and its a more positive side of things there

272135 we have discovered a part of hiv a small region on the surface of hiv that is mostly unchangeable
272136 the reason that is unchangeable is that the virus must keep it constant so that it can attach itself to cells
272137 we have a way of attacking this part of the virus using molecules called catalytic antibodies or abzymes
272138 these are antibodies with enzymatic activity they can catalyze the breakdown of thousands of virus particles per molecule of the antibody
272139 that is the eventual goal to develop a preparation that can induce immunity to the virus over the entire life span
272140 current medicines are quite expensive they run in thousands of dollars per year and our antibodies could be used in small amounts and therefore the cost of goods would be smaller

272198 im really excited as anybody would be its a great honor to play against the best amateurs from across the globe
272199 its also pretty special that there will be three of us tigers making the trip this time around i know weve had quite a few guys qualify the last few years but weve never had this many i dont think its great to be a part of that
272200 im also excited to play pinehurst for the first time thats a course with a great reputation and i was actually supposed to play there in the north and south amateur earlier this summer but had to withdraw because i was sick im definitely looking forward to it this time around
272201 i made a switch to a belly putter this summer and i think my putting was a big key in qualifying this week
272202 ive got a lot more confidence on the greens now ive always been pretty confident in my game tee to green with my ball striking but now it seems like ive got that confidence on the greens that will help me have more success in the future
272203 i hated playing that waiting game after i finished my second round
272204 i probably sat around for two hours before i found out i was in i was actually leading the entire time until the second to last group came in and someone jumped ahead of me thats when i decided to go back out to the driving range to warm up in case it came down to a playoff for the last spot

272207 the specific practice comcast was engaging in has been roundly criticized and not defended by a single other broadband provider
272208 if we arent going to stop a company that is looking inside its subscribers communications reading the packets they send blocking that communication when it uses a particular application regardless of whether there is congestion on the network hiding what it is doing by making consumers think the problem is their own and lying about it to the public what would we stop
272209 blocking unlawful content such as child pornography or pirated music or video would be consistent with federal internet policy

272211 he was captured taken into custody and 48 hours hours later was allowed to be released from the shawnee county jail never to be seen or heard from again
272212 i think there is a lot of plea bargaining that needs to be done in the district attorneys office because if not for plea bargaining we would never get any cases done
272213 i would venture to say that ive tried more cases in the last 12 months than all the other candidates put together

272245 fair amount of detailing is still to be done in this process before you actually come to the stage of placing a commercial order
272246 we will give it our best effort just as we did to each stage of the process we will try our best to move it through the next steps in future
272247 we will work with nsg members including the u s to get a clean and unconditional exemption once the nsg clears it we look forward to entering into specific detailed agreements that we need to do with partner countries
272248 and then after that the next step is actual contracts for material equipment and reactors etc so there is a fair amount of detailing still to be done in this process before you actually come to the stage of placing a commercial order what we are doing is creating an international enabling environment within which such transfers can take place one big step has been taken today in having a safeguards agreement which is an umbrella agreement into which we can bring the various arrangements we will enter into with our partners the nsg would be the next big step
272249 we have been hearing that a meeting of the nsg plenary has been called on august 21 and 22 it will consider the exemption for india
272250 but we are not in the room we are not nsg members but the fact is we believe this meeting has been called and will consider the exemption for india
272251 the relations are certainly what they were in the last four years that is why we are talking to the pakistan side
272252 as the country invests more in infrastructure the potential is more for such pumpsets this will be a sunrise sector

272254 most authoritative spokesman for the left and democratic forces in the country

272258 reaching the olympics is the biggest achievement of my career so far
272259 it is a dream which i always chased ever since i started playing
272260 there is no point in thinking of anything else you have to be focussed when you enter the court
272261 my first target will be the semifinals even reaching that is a huge task but i will not be found wanting and will give it my best
272262 at this level you have to control the game as the situation demands thankfully she is more organised in her defence now this is what we have been focussing on
272263 for many years it had been a practice for kaka to make the morning tea or coffee before nirupama bhabi left home for a religious congregation this morning at 6 30 she found kakas body stiff and cold the doctor declared him dead at 7 30 rigor mortis had already set in and kaka must have died in his sleep maybe after midnight
272264 we greeted each other on thursday morning as well as in the afternoon and he seemed to be hale and hearty he was a prolific scorer for bombay a great team and jovial man
272265 when we lost a couple of wickets he would crack jokes mimic and sing to lift the depression in the dressing room he had a great knowledge of pitch conditions and about the opponents
272266 he had the uncanny ability to make people follow him right from the college days ashok was a hero and idol for all of us
272267 he had a shrewd cricketing brain like his father he would have made a good india captain in my judgment he was wasted by the indian selectors he did not have a settled batting order and that probably affected him its sad ashok is no more
272268 its difficult to carry the mantle of the mankad surname its like asking for the moon ashok excelled as captain for mafatlal in the times of india shield
272269 he did not interfere with my game he just let me play the way i wanted
272270 i was with kaka for 12 years i learned a lot about captaincy from him definitely he was one of the best in india in terms of leadership unfortunately he did not do too well in tests if he had done that he would have probably gone on to lead india he was excellent in man management skills he had his ways to keep the team together the youngsters got a chance to mix with the seniors
272271 oh my god its very sad news he was always a jovial cricketer he enjoyed his cricket and made the people around him happy he was a very knowledgeable player
272272 ashok was captaincy material he was totally into cricket it was in his blood through his father vinoo i have not seen vinoobhai play but listening to ashok about his father was amazing experience thats when i realised what a great cricketer vinoobhai was today is one of the saddest days for me
272273 i have always been his admirer to be honest 75 per cent of whatever i am today is because of him he knew the role to be performed by each player
272274 ashok mankads contribution to test cricket will always be remembered by his countrymen
272275 i was shocked to hear the sad news mankad had a great cricketing brain and was regarded by one and all as a great tactician in the passing away of mankad the cricketing fraternity has lost a great friend philosopher and guide
272276 the significant point is that the safeguards agreement has been adopted by consensus
272277 in this film thalaivar has played a very mature age appropriate role the film highlights the beauty of friendship and has a very nice message
272278 he has done something different in the last three films in chandramukhi he played an unconventional role of a psychiatrist shivaji was a true rajini film in kuselan again he underplays
272279 there is not even one action sequence in the film but he still pulls it off thats the rajinikanth magic the climax is very touching
272280 an outstanding figure of the communist movement of the country and a prominent national politician
272281 important role in making the cpi m the largest contingent of the left movement in the country surjeet absorbed marxism leninism by sheer dint of self study and learning from experience he always stressed the fundamental importance of critically examining the partys ideological and political positions on the basis of marxism
272282 the most authoritative spokesman for the left and democratic forces in the country
272283 he worked tirelessly for the defence of democratic and secular values and to see that india maintained its non aligned and independent foreign policy his views were sought and his advice was heard with respect in political circles
272284 his was a life long fight against communalism he was one of the first leaders who recognised the threat posed by the rise of the communal forces to the secular principle of the indian state he played a crucial role in 1989 1996 and 2004 in creating the political formations and the setting up of governments which excluded the communal forces
272285 india draws a clear line of distinction between the pakistan government and rogue intelligence agencies but like u s president george bush we would like to know who is controlling the isi
272286 any player who holds a unified access service licence uasl or has expertise in 3g services can take part in the global auction for the standalone 3g spectrum a company can first bid for the spectrum and later get uasl licence to start the services
272287 though there will be no annual spectrum charge in the first year a licensee will have to pay annual spectrum charge of one per cent of annualised growth rate after a period of one year
272288 if the licensee does not achieve its roll out obligations it shall be given one year to do so but on payment of 2 5 per cent of its successful auction bid per quarter or part thereof if licensee does not complete its roll out obligations even within this one year the spectrum assignment will stand withdrawn
272289 in promoting international cooperation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy
272290 looked forward to cooperating with the agency to facilitate the implementation of the safeguards agreement in accordance with the provisions of this agreement which as the director general has pointed out should be read as an integral whole
272291 also using the guidance documents adopted by the board for the purposes of concluding and implementing infcirc 66 type agreements
272292 we see no difficulty in implementing this agreement on the basis of what is stated therein
272293 will implement this agreement in strict accordance with its provisions
272294 he became a firm ldf man only after he knew there was no chance for him in the udf
272295 india has lost a great statesman who believed in pragmatic politics
272296 the country has lost an eminent personality who was always sensitive to the social concerns of our times
272297 he was instrumental in the formation of many coalitions at the centre including the one led by me with the primary objective of preventing communal forces from occupying power
272298 in his death the country has lost an eminent personality who always fought for social causes
272299 he also played the role of a catalyst in facilitating coalition politics in india and was known for his steadfast opposition to communalism
272300 one of the outstanding leaders of the indian communist movement and a tallest leader of the cpi m
272301 at the same time the indian authorities were urged to continue to discourage indian fishermen from crossing the international line of demarcation as their presence is used by the ltte as cover for its activities
272302 u s intelligence intercepted communications between pakistani spies and terrorists
272303 conclusion was based on intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack
272304 i havent seen any evidence or proof that foreign agents were involved
272305 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
272306 determined to hamper the activities of indian companies in various parts of afghanistan
272307 a historic decision a step has been taken towards accommodating the interests of a non npt nuclear weapon state by evolving an innovative and new model a significant departure has been made from the standard norms pertaining to verification and global non proliferation which inter alia take into account the imperatives of promoting civilian nuclear cooperation
272308 an infcirc 66 type safeguards agreement based on the agencys standard safeguards practices and procedures
272309 perpetuity is a misnomer there is no such thing in international law
272310 more efficient mechanism for ensuring that safeguards requirements can be met
272311 it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
272312 such an umbrella approach could also be used for the conclusion of other 66 type safeguards agreements
272313 the termination provisions contained in the agreement are the same for other 66 type agreements
272314 naturally as with all safeguards agreements this agreement is subject to the general rules of international law therefore the agreement should be read as an integral whole the preamble provides for contextual background and safeguards are implemented in accordance with the terms of the agreement
272315 little different than those of other agreements based on infcirc 66
272316 safeguards would be applied to nuclear facilities in india using the same methods applied elsewhere in the world
272317 without this agreement the safeguards activities and the assurance of peaceful use provided by them will not be possible
272318 would we accept it if the federal agency charged with highway safety allowed cars on the road without brakes and then warned drivers to exercise extreme caution in order to avoid injury and death of course not but that in effect is the u s governments approach to something that affects all of us on the most basic level the safety of the meat poultry and produce that we eat
272319 power may be spotty in some areas but overall the island is back on its feet
272320 we want to thank aep and its hard working crews for all theyve done for us

272331 d emocracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths
272332 remember democracy never lasts long it soon wastes exhausts and murders itself there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide
272333 a democracy is a volcano which conceals the fiery materials of its own destruction these will produce an eruption and carry desolation in their way the known propensity of a democracy is to licentiousness excessive license which the ambitious call and ignorant believe to be liberty
272334 we have seen the tumult of democracy terminate as it has everywhere terminated in despotism democracy savage and wild thou who wouldst bring down the virtuous and wise to thy level of folly and guilt
272335 t he experience of all former ages had shown that of all human governments democracy was the most unstable fluctuating and short lived
272336 a simple democracy is one of the greatest of evils
272337 in democracy there are commonly tumults and disorders therefore a pure democracy is generally a very bad government it is often the most tyrannical government on earth
272338 pure democracy cannot subsist long nor be carried far into the departments of state it is very subject to caprice and the madness of popular rage
272339 it may generally be remarked that the more a government resembles a pure democracy the more they abound with disorder and confusion

272372 alpas communications are essentially a guide describing how to use sick leave inappropriately
272373 there is no mixture of the two systems possible there is no such thing as a mixed economy a system that would be in part capitalistic and in part socialist
272374 even the most primitive husbandmen are dimly aware of the consequences of acts which to a modern accountant would appear as capital consumption
272375 the concept of capital cannot be separated from the context of monetary calculation and from the social structure of a market economy in which alone monetary calculation is possible
272376 in a socialist economy there are capital goods but no capital the notion of capital makes sense only in the market economy it is not a category of all acting it is a category of acting within a market economy
272377 if historical experience could teach us anything it would be that private property is inextricably linked with civilization
272378 the psychological problem of why people scorn and disparage capitalism and call everything they dislike capitalistic and everything they praise socialistic concerns history and must be left to the historians
272379 entrepreneurs grown old and tired and the decadent heirs of people who succeeded in the past dislike the agile parvenus who challenge their wealth and their eminent social position
272380 the consumers not the entrepreneurs pay ultimately the wages earned by every worker the glamorous movie star as well as the charwoman
272381 even messenger boys know that the boss runs things around the shop but it requires a little more brains to notice the entrepreneurs dependence on the market
272382 to assign to everybody his proper place in society is the task of the consumers their buying and abstention from buying is instrumental in determining each individuals social position

272388 planning for freedom has lately become the most popular slogan of the champions of totalitarian government and the russification of all nations
272389 the market does not directly prevent anybody from arbitrarily inflicting harm on his fellow citizens it only puts a penalty upon such conduct

272428 for us its all about making sports easier to understand says david neal nbcs executive vice president in charge of olympics coverage
272429 but the best technical innovations are the ones that take the viewer on a magic carpet ride they transport the television viewer out of their easy chair at home and give them a sense of what its like to be on the field of play
272430 i remember as a kid watching and saying wow how do they do that the olympics were always the showcases for all of the newest technology roone set the gold standard
272431 we were trying to figure out how you can capture the madness of someone getting on a 10 meter platform and actually thinking that its a good idea to dive off that thing three stories up and go into the water he recalls

272433 you see these unusual botticelli like images of the swimmers brown says
272434 these systems allow the viewer to see sights that have not been seen before that are just ravishing

272445 we believe this is important not only for us and our bilateral relationship with india but for rest of the world

272448 todays agreement represents a major step forward to opening civil nuclear cooperation with india while strengthening the worlds nonproliferation regime
272449 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create precedence and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine weapon activities
272450 i believe we are sending some strong and clear messages firstly that such activity will not be tolerated and secondly that no company is above the law
272451 first we have to continue talking with the federal government and our provincial counterparts around how this is split up amongst the parties and then go from there in terms of what we might see as a positive use for it

272541 it could be this wrong so do this if this doesnt fix it this could be wrong so do this etc
272542 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
272543 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
272544 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
272545 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
272546 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
272547 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
272548 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
272549 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
272550 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
272551 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
272552 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
272553 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
272554 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
272555 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
272556 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
272557 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
272558 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
272559 since we had a locked in life in prison it wasnt as if she was going to walk free
272560 obviously she was disappointed she didnt get a new trial also because shes maintained her innocence from the beginning
272561 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
272562 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
272563 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
272564 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
272565 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
272566 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
272567 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
272568 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
272569 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

272572 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
272573 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
272574 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
272575 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
272576 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
272577 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
272578 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
272579 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
272580 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
272581 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
272582 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
272583 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
272584 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
272585 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
272586 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
272587 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
272588 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
272589 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
272590 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
272591 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
272592 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

272594 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
272595 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
272596 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
272597 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
272598 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
272599 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
272600 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
272601 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
272602 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
272603 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

272609 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
272610 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
272611 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
272612 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
272613 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

272711 when i directed for colored girls that production was about african american women who needed to have the power that they did not recognize they had with these black men in resurrection it is about them recognizing their power we as a people have to understand that we have the power within us if you fall you have the power to get yourself up we have to start using our own strength and that self empowerment is what resurrection is all about
272712 the intent of this work is to remind us all that no matter the difficulties we may be facing there is always hope and the possibility to overcome moreover this overcoming this resurrection is crucial to our children

272723 physicians usually underestimate the administrative requirements of running an office
272724 the physician entrepreneur who practices medicine for 40 hours a week will spend another 20 to 30 hours handling administrative tasks dealing with staff and suppliers reviewing hmo contracts working with billing departments on denied claims working with a cpa to ensure accurate accounting for tax purposes working with an attorney to draft employment agreements and other documents or responding to complaints from patients and inquiries from insurers an office manager can assume some of these responsibilities but many matters will still require your attention
272725 physicians with a high need for control autonomy and fame often do best in solo or very small group practices you need to assess your own tolerance for risk
272726 identify two or three communities in the area where you want to practice
272727 then look at the population figures to see if theres a need for doctors in your specialty dont assume that a demographic analysis is a sizable project only to be undertaken by large corporations inexpensive limited studies can be extremely valuable in selecting a location and avoiding a big mistake
272728 hospitals are a perfect starting point to get you connected to the community
272729 the marketing and planning department may have conducted a demographic analysis and be willing to share it with you they also can give you a list of the payers they contract with so that youll get a better understanding of the payer mix the local newspapers advertising department may have population figures the chamber of commerce and local library have information about the community and its schools services growth and economic profile
272730 but we noticed that 75 percent of the physicians were over 50 a doctor who chose to locate there would be well positioned to pick up patients as the established physicians retired
272731 speak to the medical directors of the five largest plans that cover the area
272732 they may tell you that theres a need for another physician in your specialty and as long as youre board certified you wont have a problem getting on insurance panels or just as important they might tell you they have all the physicians they need
272733 dont set up shop in a community that doesnt appeal to your spouse
272734 in fact hospital recruiters have a saying that the three most important things in attracting a physician are recruit the spouse recruit the spouse recruit the spouse
272735 a compatible partner should share your business philosophy and your vision of the practice in addition to respecting each other as clinicians you need to discuss work schedules call office hours managed care medicare and medicaid finances staffing possibilities and other aspects of day to day operations if your approach to the business side of practice is very different consider going solo or looking for another partner

272800 aj was the most consistent contributor on the team last summer
272801 why dont you want to be with someone who thinks the world of you

272803 i thought when my love for you died i should die its dead alone most strangely i live on indeed i am self delusional

272806 i like crocs theyre so comfortable ill tell you who the dork is the guy writing this story thats who and who died and made him the fashion authority anyway
272807 was it over when the germans bombed pearl harbor hell no
272808 people who wear crocs go on and on about how comfortable they are and how its supposedly odor resistant because its made out of some kind of anti bacterial foam you know what else its resistant to you getting laid
272809 ive given fashion the finger and joined the dorcs revolution

272812 starbucks increasingly appealed to grab and go sic customers for whom service meant speed of order delivery rather than recognition by and conversation with a barista
272813 the point of saturation is reached and cannibalization of existing store sales undermines not just brand health but also manager morale
272814 i hope chinese media enhance the report of chinese traditional culture
272815 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
272816 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
272817 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
272818 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
272819 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet

272823 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
272824 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
272825 no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
272826 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
272827 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
272828 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
272829 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
272830 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
272831 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
272832 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
272833 junk propaganda emanating from the intergovernmental panel on climate change and scientists like david suzuki et al
272834 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
272835 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
272836 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
272837 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
272838 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
272839 how the women of the media sell unhappiness and liberalism to the women of america
272840 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
272841 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
272842 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
272843 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
272844 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
272845 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
272846 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
272847 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
272848 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
272849 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
272850 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
272851 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
272852 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
272853 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
272854 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
272855 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
272856 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
272857 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
272858 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
272859 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
272860 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
272861 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
272862 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
272863 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
272864 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
272865 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
272866 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
272867 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
272868 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
272869 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
272870 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
272871 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
272872 integrated into a mainstream investment process in a way that enhances profitability
272873 an inconvenient truth the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do about it
272874 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
272875 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
272876 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
272877 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
272878 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
272879 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
272880 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
272881 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
272882 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
272883 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
272884 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
272885 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
272886 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
272887 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
272888 he just said we need to do all these things
272889 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward
272890 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
272891 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
272892 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
272893 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
272894 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
272895 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
272896 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
272897 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
272898 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
272899 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
272900 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
272901 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
272902 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
272903 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
272904 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
272905 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
272906 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
272907 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
272908 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
272909 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
272910 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
272911 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
272912 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
272913 if only al gore had stopped with the invention of the internet instead of going on to invent global warming
272914 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
272915 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
272916 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
272917 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
272918 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
272919 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
272920 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
272921 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
272922 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
272923 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
272924 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
272925 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
272926 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
272927 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
272928 i felt like if youre going to clean something it really should be clean
272929 but i had seven children i wanted to go on home i told him im not staying these arent slavery times anymore he said i had to stay i walked
272930 one day we decided to march on the welfare office we asked to see their policies their manual of how they would treat us they said the state couldnt do that so we went up the back steps on a friday afternoon went into the directors office and told him we wouldnt let him leave
272931 storming caesars palace how black mothers fought their own war on poverty
272932 finally we understand that the civil rights movement was a lot bigger and longer than martin luther king as wonderful and important as he was
272933 there are so many levels on which this movement was important not only statewide but nationwide
272934 and theres no question ruby was in the absolute forefront
272935 as long as they graduated and walked across that stage that was enough
272936 it was exciting to see how poor people could stand up
272937 just the way she looked you could feel her power it was so uplifting
272938 im glad shes finally being recognized for all that shes done
272939 so many people give up homes so many jobless people
272940 let somebody make me wealthy before i leave just for one year
272941 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
272942 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
272943 best buzz money could buy and landed with a thud
272944 its gotten to the point where a neighbor cant register another neighbor to vote
272945 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
272946 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
272947 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
272948 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
272949 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
272950 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
272951 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
272952 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
272953 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
272954 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
272955 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
272956 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
272957 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
272958 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
272959 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
272960 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
272961 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
272962 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
272963 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
272964 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
272965 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
272966 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
272967 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
272968 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
272969 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
272970 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
272971 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
272972 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
272973 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
272974 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
272975 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
272976 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
272977 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
272978 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
272979 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
272980 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
272981 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
272982 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
272983 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
272984 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
272985 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

273001 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
273002 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
273003 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
273004 if the vice president says its do able i believe

273057 the door has been opened to export same sex marriage to other parts of the country
273058 this takes the dam away from the border holding back same sex marriage in massachusetts and releases it across the country
273059 simply to make sure that when out of state couples come to massachusetts theyre going to able to participate in our states principles of equality and fairness
273060 states are going to have to sort this out over time

273064 adding gender identity and sexual orientation as a special sub group for discrimination protection to a law that already protects everyone is unnecessary and an insidious motive to destroy marriage between a man and a woman and to destroy marriage as god ordained it

273066 he dejado la puerta abierta hasta el final pero la noche antes de cerrar la negociaci n esa puerta se cerr
273067 miro hacia atr s y veo cinco a os de mi vida muy felices me quedo con lo positivo y voy a apoyar al levante desde fuera
273068 dicen que los malos momentos cuanto antes se borren mejor pero en estos ltimos ocho meses he aprendido que hay gente por la que merece la pena levantarse cada d a con ganas de luchar y darlo todo
273069 una persona honrada que trat de dar el m ximo
273070 he tratado de tener un comportamiento que en ocasiones ha podido parecer duro pero educado y creo que supe llegar a este club y voy a saber marcharme
273071 la mejor manera es mantener la boca cerrada en algunos momentos yo s lo que he vivido en primera persona y muchos de mis compa eros tambi n
273072 un hombre que es el futbolista que m s a os ha jugado en el f tbol profesional en la historia del levante once temporadas creo que tendr a que tener m s de una l nea en la p gina oficial
273073 si hubiese optado por buscarse otra salida la hubiera encontrado y estaba vinculado a un club a una ciudad
273074 merece un lugar importante entre los deportistas del levante y me gustar a que se reconociera desde el club y la afici n

273082 john is pretty disappointed we didn t have the manpower and resources to have a game for the launch of the
273083 it appears that at this point that given the size of our team we can only work on one mobile game at a time we are probably partner up and the first iphone game will be one where we work with a publishing partner
273084 but its too early to say if thats going to happen at this point
273085 the iphone is cool and the n gage was a nerd device
273086 the iphone is a pretty damn awesome phone it s a great business device its one of the best portable mp3 player you can buy it can play videos theres a lot of reasons to have that device and it has the power to play games as well it s a cool device that you can play games on and they can be awesome games
273087 going to be competing with all of those other things you can do on the iphone that are pretty cool that s the challenge
273088 it does raise the bar on what you need to do from a game standpoint

273097 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
273098 i am proud to add my name as well to the list of those who support the aims and principles of the education equality project
273099 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
273100 the education equality project is a practical plan for delivering change and restoring hope for children and parents who need a lot of both and if senator obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
273101 i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric

273123 derrick is in the middle of the pack in punting in this league
273124 hes not a bad punter and hes not one of the elite guys i think he can do better he had an off year he would admit that as well hes had slumps in the past that hes come out of this particular year he didnt really come out of it that generated this competition

273173 if i had to guess id say you were in the medical field although its only a weak hunch thats another place where humanities people wear the cloak of science its not an insult and they wouldnt take it that way as they view scientists as a bunch of sub elite nerds
273174 the sciences are becoming more and more useful in informing us about things that were difficult to explain like the arts we may not be there yet and it is good to remain humble about what we do and do not know science will eventually explain a good deal about the arts that many artists and critics would prefer to remain under wraps artists tend to resist scientific explanation because they like to cultivate a cult of mystery surrounding what they do they like to present themselves as a kind of secular priesthood in touch with mysterious forces science kills this though ironically it doesnt make an artists work any less enjoyable as an experience
273175 within science physics is the gold standard by which other disciplines judge themselves
273176 sj goulds ideas really dont make sense if you extract the moralizing sj goulds main ideas are 1 that evolution occurs mostly by periods of fast change spliced with periods of long stasis 2 that adaptation is just one of the components that explain the forms of modern organisms with an emphasis on previous history as another component and 3 that species level selection i e decimation of entire species is an important factor in evolution in opposition to the supposed focus on the continuous adaptation of species by individual selection

273279 having scored the number of runs i have so far this year in test cricket of course i felt a lot of pressure
273280 not so much from the outside but knowing you have to contribute
273281 feeling as though i have not been contributing and letting the team down is how it has been for me over the last few weeks so today was very special
273282 things went my way from the start and it is a day i will never forget because it has been tough over the last couple of months
273283 vaughan said something very important to me just before i went out dont be reckless but be aggressive
273284 i quite enjoy having that freedom from the skipper and i wasnt going to change my way even in the 90s
273285 from ball one i wanted to go out there and be aggressive and i wanted to continue in that manner risk it for the biscuit
273286 everybody realised how difficult it has been over the past few months and they have said a score has just been around the corner and today proved that
273287 i just wanted to keep the same rhythm and i didnt want to upset that
273288 sometimes you see people get out straight after a hundred because they think they have made it i just wanted to keep the same rhythm rather than run around like a loony tune
273289 if we can get up to 280 300 ahead its always a difficult score to knock off
273290 as a team we have to go out and play as hard as possible
273291 it simply wasnt good enough and we have got that out of the way in the dressing room
273292 we have got a gift tomorrow morning and thats the second new ball and we have to make it work the game is now on a knife edge
273293 we asked the guys to forget about outcomes and we actually forgot about everything else we spoke about
273294 as i have always said you can set up the most brilliant plans in the world but you still have to execute them
273295 we wanted to have colly feeling outside off stump and he got off the mark pulling that said everything about our performance

273298 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
273299 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
273300 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
273301 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
273302 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
273303 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
273304 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
273305 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
273306 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out

273309 until we hear from apple its hard to say what the real reason is because if it was at amp t well at amp t is not the iphone service provider outside the u s
273310 the iphone is not intended to be used as a tethering device and we have no plans to offer separate tethering plans for it
273311 we offer laptopconnect cards that you can use to access our wireless data network those cards offer typical download speeds as high as 1 7 mbps
273312 for customers looking for a smartphone with tethering capability we have many other options
273313 sorry to all the folks that couldnt get it in time
273314 were hoping well get some feedback from apple tomorrow at the very least i would hope apple will allow it in countries where the provider does permit tethering
273315 i got worried and started walking through the paddock and found more deer i went round and there was 1080 everywhere

273317 it was my fathers and my understanding that the paddocks were excluded
273318 it is a huge disappointment that we are losing the native birds and now our herd
273319 im not happy to accept this at all im not happy with how this has been handled its a severe case of mis communication
273320 the bait was shifted or wayne and his father mis communicated

273322 as the rock n roll series continues to grow we take special care in choosing a city we know our runners will love
273323 each destination brings a unique flavor to our series as a whole and we strive to provide the very best to our participants by creating world class events nationwide
273324 the rock and roll marathon concept is truly the first of its kind
273325 those of us who have been with the rock and roll series since the start knew the events would attract runners to the sport because the concept was aimed at positively influencing people and the sport of distance running
273326 the rock n roll marathon is the original musical marathon concept and it holds a special place in our hearts here at elite racing
273327 today most running vents have a budget for on course entertainment but we pride ourselves on being the innovators of the rock n run model
273328 the rock n roll marathon has become one of the signature destinations for the team in training program
273329 our 11 years of involvement with the national series has been a partnership ive seen grow and improve with each and every event

273371 kilo kai is the perfect rum for aficionados and novices alike because its complexity and unique blend of flavors allows it to be mixed in a favorite cocktail or enjoyed straight up
273372 kilo kais growth has come primarily from word of mouth most people hear about kilo kai rum mostly through bartenders musicians waiters and others connected to nightlife culture and hospitality
273373 kilo kai is the rum you drink when you have decided that taste is more important
273374 spiced the way rum ought to be kilo kai was much smoother with a creamy texture and a clear flavor of honey and cinnamon

273440 theyre people who either dont remember what was going on in the 80s or think that with all the medications available now its no big deal to contract hiv that its like having asthma
273441 we need to get back to doing education in the schools which we havent been doing for the past few years
273442 weve seen a loss of funding for education and when hiv aids is discussed in the classroom it is lumped in with other sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea or syphilis which are curable
273443 it does not allow for the best quality of life
273444 if we dont get a handle on this now its just will spiral into a situation that is much worse than it already is
273445 the bottom line is that the hiv epidemic in the u s continues to spread and at a rate greater than was previously thought
273446 the real measure of political leaders and the american people is if this bad news spurs good action the establishment of a comprehensive and accountable national aids strategy that will eliminate barriers to effective prevention generate adequate resources and hold our government accountable for ending this epidemic
273447 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
273448 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
273449 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
273450 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
273451 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
273452 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue
273453 realistically that track did something that weve never seen it do before and thats not take rubber
273454 that is somehow different from what we experienced in 06 and 07
273455 the whole combination of that tire the car of tomorrow on that racetrack caused that right rear tire to wear like we had never seen before the fronts were similar to what we had seen in 06 and 07 the wear improved on the front but the rear never got any better
273456 not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
273457 to convince the world that she was the initiator not the victim
273458 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
273459 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
273460 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
273461 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
273462 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates
273463 claro que eu quero que o cr dito aumente o cr dito um dos dinamizadores dos investimentos e do consumo s que estava crescendo mais que 30 ao ano eu quero que continue crescendo mas menos que 30 ao ano ent o tomamos algumas medidas
273464 its broad based weakness not huge declines anywhere but very widely spread
273465 its a slow drop deterioration not catastrophic but every month it gets worse
273466 there are some real macro indicators that point to unemployment spiking
273467 its ugly there are just not a lot of jobs out there
273468 theyre sending me e mails of customer service positions at 10 an hour
273469 obama has been addressing the environment and energy issues with a focus on global warming and the rising cost of fuel in many of his ads this summer
273470 his commitment to healthcare is visible in many of obamas recent ads ending the iraq war and investing that money here at home is also very important to obama and was mentioned in his ads this summer
273471 in mccains ads he addresses cutting government spending improving national security making healthcare affordable and accessible for all americans and the need to combat climate change and lower gas prices

273520 the wal mart human resources managers who run the meetings dont specifically tell attendees how to vote in novembers election but make it clear that voting for democratic presidential hopeful sen barack obama would be tantamount to inviting unions in
273521 i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
273522 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval

273533 so id been out of town for a couple of days and just heading to the to have dinner
273534 i think it was saturday or sunday after the accident was my next memory
273535 i just got this awful feeling and i looked at my mom and i said we need to turn off the dvd
273536 i got sick to my stomach and i looked at my mom and im like karge was on the bridge
273537 i just know i feel it i know he was on it and i know hes hurt i know hes not dead but i know he was on it
273538 i look down at my phone and i see four missed calls from him
273539 i just prayed and prayed and prayed and finally about a half hour of doing that i got this feeling like you got to pick yourself up off this bed and go turn the tv on
273540 he was alive thank god for that that was my little miracle in that moment that i needed to keep getting me through those hours
273541 around 11 30 i got a phone call from my aunt saying we found him
273542 he walks up to me and he says alright i need to talk to you
273543 he was just covered in dirt and blood and glass
273544 fractured neck in two places broken clavicle separated shoulder multiple puncture wounds five broken bones in my foot ive had six surgeries to date probably have two to three more to go so i got pretty banged up
273545 id be like you were on a bridge that collapsed
273546 apparently i had the same conversation with people for four days straight asking where am i
273547 youd tell him the whole thing over and it would be the complete shock over and over again
273548 and one day i woke up and started making new memories
273549 not to sound like a martyr or anything but every step i take hurts
273550 cause i cant do anything to fix it or help it or make it go away
273551 this is what i was wearing that day and honestly i have to tell you these were my favorite pair of pants
273552 that would be from the puncture wounds in my knee
273553 i dont know why i kept it to be honest with you it just sits in the basement this is part of a story that i dont remember
273554 id be curious if someone watching this story goes i pulled him out of a car or i got him into the back of a pickup truck or i made sure he got into a hospital er
273555 because of the lords great love we are not consumed for his compassions never fail they are new every morning great is your faithfulness
273556 in moments of tragedy or in everyday moments none of us are alone in the beloved community of minnesota
273557 we will prove that the common ground that holds us together is unshakable
273558 we did as you know talk about the potential implications of the gusset plates
273559 and also were looking at aspects of rust corrosion that type of thing but nothing has been ruled out
273560 the damage patterns the fracture features uncovered in the investigation to date suggest that the collapse of the deck truss portion of the bridge was related to the failed gusset plates and in particular may have originated with the failure of the gusset plates at one of the eight nodes
273561 and finally end with appropriate recommendations to prevent that type of accident from happening again
273562 when you say are we going to have the definite moment that is still to be determined here but you will have and the people of minnesota will have a very good a very thorough understanding of what the probable cause is
273563 if the board does its job they will cite corrosion metal fatigue underdesign of the gusset failure to conduct periodic effective inspections of and maintenance of the bridge
273564 we have to be transparent in how we communicate work with the legislature and be transparent with those folks we got to follow through on what we say were going to do we really got to respect public values
273565 in the end if we can begin to do all these things i think the trust will come back
273566 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
273567 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
273568 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
273569 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
273570 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
273571 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
273572 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
273573 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
273574 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
273575 do you think that because mccain is coming out so strong on the negative side against obama and obama is not returning that negativity that it will hurt him at election time
273576 we were reacting to what barack obama himself said about john mccain
273577 and i think we were perfectly within our rights to protect our candidate and to point out that were not going to lay down for these kinds of tactics and i think that was fair well let the chips fall where they may when it comes to how people perceive this but we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain whos fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist weve seen this happen before and weve not going to let it happen to us
273578 he said it to a crowd in rural missouri 99 percent white
273579 there were all kinds of press there nobody reported it as a racial comment nobody certainly said what rick davis just said that he called john mccain a racist the only time this became an issue was when rick davis and their campaign decided to kick it up and make it a racial issue and thats exactly what theyve been running a negative campaign for weeks
273580 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
273581 they got rid of rebecca they was getting rid of me
273582 have a good week ill screw you all over in the eviction interview
273583 the next time i kiss rebecca could be in a hotel room
273584 i am extremely humbled and grateful that nbc news is giving me this opportunity
273585 i believe youth issues will continue to play a significant role during this election and i want to do my part reporting them honestly and objectively
273586 the environment the war in iraq and healthcare seem to be what matters most to young adults
273587 the order switches off but the truth is many twenty somethings living in new york city realize that with the cost of living being so high and the fact that most jobs dont provide health benefits that healthcare is extremely important
273588 if we close some of the loopholes in our system weve put forward tax relief plans that will not only restore fairness to our tax code but it also puts money into the pockets of hard working americans who need it right now who will spend it and will actually improve our economic growth over time particularly at a time when were seeing a credit crunch
273589 i will bring them home in victory we will have a stable iraq that we wont have to return to because we have succeeded in the strategy and we will come home with victory and honor and defeat
273590 theres starting to be a broad consensus that its time for us to withdraw some of our combat troops out of iraq deploy them here in afghanistan
273591 and i think we have to seize that opportunity nows the time for us to do it

273629 la pista era molto sporca stamani quindi abbiamo aspettato prima di iniziare il nostro programma ancora una volta la vettura e apparsa buona anche se ho incontrato molto traffico in entrambe le sessioni questo pomeriggio ho anche provato per la prima volta il nuovo pacchetto aerodinamico sembra senza dubbio aver reso piu bilanciata la vettura il che e molto incoraggiante
273630 un altra giornata positiva per noi la vettura ha iniziato la giornata in modo competitivo ma siamo stati in grado di migliorare in entrambe le sessioni questo pomeriggio sono stato in grado di trovare un bilanciamento particolarmente buono e mi sono concentrato nel risparmiare le gomme piuttosto che sui tempi ho accusato un po di graining ma la situazione sembra molto promettente per domani
273631 oggi sono state due sessioni piu o meno senza problemi a parte il traffico di stamani che non e insolito su questo circuito detto questo i problemi di traffico non sono stati sufficienti per disturbare il nostro programma il pacchetto aerodinamico approntato per questa gara sembra aver fornito i risultati attesi e la prestazione della vettura e stata incoraggiante finora

273639 theres an awful lot of buzz and excitement about the program
273640 our football program has done a good job to continue from the recruiting class prior to the 07 season through the 07 season through recruiting and through spring practice
273641 this year i already know how coach davis goes about practice
273642 i know how he wants us to carry ourselves were loose around each other and we need that relationship but when its time to get serious he has our full attention because he knows how to get us where we want to be
273643 we dont have to start from step one this year
273644 from the schematic standpoint well do things today we never did last year in our twelfth ballgame
273645 weve grown to the point that we can challenge them mentally with schemes and protections the greatest thing is that now they know the tempo and know how to practice an important part of a football team is how to practice
273646 theres an obvious sense of urgency and people are excited that expectations are higher
273647 we always make every effort to respond to the needs and concerns of the families who visit our communities and we believe gladstones promotional incentives and service offerings will address some of the biggest hurdles they face in the current economy
273648 as a semi custom home builder we know that theres no one size fits all when it comes to a customers home and we extend that thinking to our incentives
273649 we are pleased to have been able to come to an agreement with both kinross and hecla to acquire 100 of the property the golden eagle property offers a very attractive underground high grade vein exploration target on private ground we believe that exploring under the historic two million ounce hot springs system is an attractive place to find more high grade gold this target is adjacent to the republic knob hill veins which produced high grade gold for hecla for over 20 years we will also review options to process sulfide mineralization in view of newer technologies and the economics afforded by a higher gold price the ability to explore the deeper targets combined with the strategic access to kinross nearby mill is a bonus that could add value to any new oxide ounces discovered on the property

273662 we are very disappointed with our results not only for the second quarter but year to date in 2008 this is a trying economic environment and our results reflect that along with many of our peers bank of the carolinas has experienced increased levels of non performing assets over the last year however based on our best determination of current market values our bank has written down these assets to realizable amounts reserved for potential losses and we remain well capitalized while excessive land development and construction credits have proven troublesome to the industry these loans at bank of the carolinas remain relatively stable at a modest 14 6 of our portfolio
273663 as evidenced by a 19 7 million increase in our savings balances at june 30 2008 compared to june 30 2007 a key focal point for our bank is to increase core funding so that we are less dependent on volatile liabilities and therefore less sensitive to interest rate swings additionally we have reduced and will continue to reduce costs where doing so does not adversely impact our ability to serve our loyal customers we regard our customers as our greatest asset
273664 together with the non temporary charges taken in previous periods these additional charges to our bond portfolios are intended to reflect managements current views as to their value taking into consideration both our near and long term concerns regarding the absence of liquidity and the extreme volatility of the markets in which the bonds trade managements assessment and determination of the appropriate charges is further based on an ongoing comprehensive review and stress analysis of the underlying real estate collateral supporting our bond portfolio finally rather than characterizing current market reductions as either temporary or non temporary charges management has now elected in all cases to characterize all of the existing charges as non temporary charges in view of our expressed concerns relating to long term bond market conditions the reserves to our loan portfolio similarly reflect our current viewpoint as to these two particular loans in the context of overall real estate market conditions

273701 the speed of settlement expansion the speed of the creation of new apartheid roads throughout the occupied west bank the speed in which palestinians are being squeezed into smaller and smaller territory smaller lives resulting in smaller and smaller identities is proceeding at a pace that i found absolutely shocking
273702 you have some towns like the city of qalqilia in the northern west bank completely surrounded by the wall the city next to it a tiny little town is also completely surrounded by the wall
273703 its a very isolating kind of existence for those 40 000 people who live for example in the city of qalqilia once a market town right on the green line

273723 id like to know how unusual it is for an elite law school like chicago to offer a tenured position to a professor who has not produced any academic writing
273724 ferret out the students understanding but also the cracks and fissures in the supreme courts current approach to the constitution
273725 from 1992 until his election to the u s senate in 2004 barack obama served as a professor in the law school he was a lecturer from 1992 to 1996 he was a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004 during which time he taught three courses per year senior lecturers are considered to be members of the law school faculty and are regarded as professors
273726 senior lecturers are considered to be members of the law school faculty and are regarded as professors although not full time or tenure track the title of senior lecturer is distinct from the title of lecturer which signifies adjunct status like obama each of the law schools senior lecturers has high demand careers in politics or public service which prevent full time teaching several times during his 12 years as a professor in the law school obama was invited to join the faculty in a full time tenure track position but he declined
273727 from 1992 until his election to the u s senate in 2004 barack obama served as a professor in the law school he was a lecturer from 1992 to 1996 he was a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004 during which time he taught three courses per year senior lecturers are considered to be members of the law school faculty and are regarded as professors although not full time or tenure track the title of senior lecturer is distinct from the title of lecturer which signifies adjunct status like obama each of the law schools senior lecturers has high demand careers in politics or public service which prevent full time teaching several times during his 12 years as a professor in the law school obama was invited to join the faculty in a full time tenure track position but he declined
273728 given the way obama has campaigned from the very beginning he comes across as just another politician who will say and do anything to get elected
273729 those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it those who do not remember their past are condemned to repeat their mistakes
273730 you have just passed the bar in the state of nirvana
273731 you have just been selected as the democratic candidate for president of the state of nirvana
273732 no im a strong believer in knowing what youre doing when you apply for a job
273733 1 this is an open book exam you may underlined use any materials or notes used in our class you may not underlined refer to cases articles etc that were not used in class
273734 im a lawyer a state senator and i teach a couple of courses at the u of c
273735 clearly obama has intellectual abilities that the general public does not fully appreciate
273736 this man is obviously too intelligent too literate too humane too knowledgeable too decent to be president
273737 take a stand and offer concrete proposals or approaches to the problem
273738 enigmatic presence often leaving fellow faculty members guessing about his precise views
273739 he was polite eager to please and a little distant
273740 faculty saw an opening and made him its best offer yet tenure upon hiring
273741 a successful teacher and an absentee tenant on the other issues
273742 whacking yourself on the head until senseless 101 you made princeton look bad
273743 michael anyone who is not in academia doesn t really care about the difference between a professor or a lecturer
273744 how exactly did senator obama build his career off his race
273745 in his 12 yrs as a law professor obama had never published anything what does that say about his willingness to put his name to anything no guts
273746 obama s 1997 memo argues that the state s argument against self willed cloning for reasons of social ostracism endorses eugenics and discrimination 1997 memo p 5 this may be but to me the question of cloning humans so far is merely academic pre natal screening for genetic deficiency tied as it is the health care insurance industry continues to be a real issue why not give a law school class this issue to debate
273747 while law students do not write and defend dissertations they endure three years of academic boot camp where only the fittest survive
273748 the j d is most definitely a post graduate degree in that completion of a bachelor s degree is always a prerequisite
273749 if this choice is between a guy who graduated at the top of his classes at columbia university and harvard law was president of the harvard law review a law teacher lecturer professor at u of chicago and wrote two books vs
273750 in a few small pockets of the backwoods of the sticks
273751 your excuses indicate that both of you are actually racist and that s why you will not vote for senator obama
273752 as a law school graduate and thus one who has taken con law i found obama s exam questions odd in that they so narrowly focused only on race gender equal protection perhaps in the pop intellectual world that so many of his followers inhabit this is all there is however when i took con law the majority of the classes focused on things like the structure of government and the commerce clause thats the feds ability to regulate everything from speed limits to shampo while not as hip as the struggel for equailty this are much more practicale and important issues if obama s exams are representive of the material covered then his students were far less educated then they should have been
273753 in fairness shouldn t you also examine some of mccain s student papers from the naval academy they should prove equally challenging it s my understanding that at least two classmates finished with a lower rank than his
273754 state in your own words why a torpedo can disable an enemy ship if it is aimed right
273755 true i false a gun that fires rapidly is more likely to kill more people as long as the person firing the gun points it at the enemy and not at himself
273756 another egotistical egg head who is coming down from mount olympus to tell us lesser folk what is right yes i know obama is smarter than me and everybody else yes i know the brilliant people all support obama and anybody who disagrees with a word he says is a racist i don t look forward to the next 4 years of obama and his race baiting allies and acolytes
273757 i d like to know how unusual it is for an elite law school like chicago to offer a tenured position to a professor who has not produced any academic writing
273758 post 205 azar your excuses indicate that both of you are actually racist and that s why you will not vote for senator obama
273759 way to make huge assumptions off from a few words on a post
273760 why is senator obama receiving such rigorous scrutiny for excellent and good work while senator mccain s blunders and lies go without consideration or critique
273761 how unusual it is for an elite law school like chicago to offer a tenured position to a professor who has not produced any academic writing
273762 how i wish the days of brilliant oratory is back in our civic engagement not only will that help citizens be better informed
273763 when you re thinking you are probably not shopping or working how can such an activity justify itself economically
273764 obama has an excellent record from his time in the illinois senate and the us senate
273765 this great country provides a strong foundation and every opportunity to allow them to do so
273766 is it possible that he succeeded for some other reasons such as manipulation and ruthlessness
273767 he was also an enigmatic one often leaving fellow faculty members guessing about his precise views
273768 we lost vietnam because we lost our will to fight
273769 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
273770 i will take a man who loves his country enough to die for it john mccain is an american hero what has barack obama done for his country
273771 i can t help thinking obama s students and conservative colleagues would have been very sensitive to manipulation and ruthlessness had it been part of obama s m o
273772 we can disagree but we dont have to be disagreeable
273773 the ultimate pragmatist a deliberate thinker who fashions carefully nuanced positions that manage to win him support from people with divergent views
273774 those who are critical of obama s non existent publication record should remember that obama was a state senator and a practicing attorney while teaching classes at u
273775 no students were denied admission to the public schools in seattle
273776 one way to approach this question as most of you recognized as many of you discussed a few of you suggested as several of you noted since i wrote the exam
273777 if i may suspend modesty i think i put together a pretty interesting reading list complete with critical ussc decisions on voting rights and articles tying the struggles for voting rights to the current situation as preclearance states continue to find ways to stoke their legacy of disenfranchisement does that qualify me to be president of the united states no
273778 many americans have decided that he is trained experienced and talented hence we are voting for him
273779 anna i m not certain what point you are trying to make
273780 hurrah we have found an intelligent person we have president
273781 therefore you will have to vote for and then live with one of those candidates
273782 personally i would like a president who understands that not everything can best be seen in black and white

273809 theres no doubt that false and damaging rumours were circulating about hbos on march 19 2008 and these would have had some impact on hboss share price
273810 it is difficult however to say how much impact as the share price was also affected by the interaction of a number of other complex factors on the day
273811 we are examining what policies are in place and how firms ensure compliance with them whether and how rumours are verified whether traders are permitted to pass on or trade on rumours and how firms ensure staff do not either initiate or spread false rumours

273818 ethics in business is fundamental and it has to begin from the admission process mba programmes especially the top ones are so competitive and unfortunately some candidates will do anything to get accepted
273819 this is a growing problem weve even seen some students paying for fake degree certificates online its unbelievable
273820 even if a site is illegally able to obtain some real questions it is extremely unlikely that a test taker will see the same questions on the live exam
273821 to end up this way after months of negotiations is just unbelievable
273822 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful we thought it was a good deal and we were ready to accept edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders it is now a matter for both boards to see how to proceed
273823 it was an extremely unhappy ship and they wanted out
273824 huge financial irregularities and suspected fraud on the indian desk of ubs in london
273825 when these issues were added to the mistrust that was already there it is perhaps not surprising that they were receptive to my invitation to them to join vestra
273826 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders
273827 at no point did this board or management in any way ever resist microsofts proposal
273828 we proactively engaged with them and tried to reach a positive conclusion for shareholders
273829 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts

273831 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
273832 we have already stressed to him that his citizenship is of the utmost importance he understands that anything less than exemplary behavior will not be tolerated

273834 i can tell you that the state of the infrastructure in the nation today is improving albeit slightly it is improving

273837 basic economics says that if you reduce the price of goods than consumers buy more and buy more they certainly did in july and indeed most of the year
273838 gm canadas july sales continue to illustrate the ongoing shift toward cars and smaller crossovers and we have the vehicles and retail finance rates to satisfy that need
273839 when gm is up the market is usually up since they are still the dominant seller in canada by a wide margin

273869 maybe a shelf doesnt have to be what youve always been told it is
273870 growing up i would buy posters and mash them together on the wall
273871 you could use any number of things wallpaper movie posters photographs dust jackets from books junk food wrappers crushed soda cans
273872 and you can customize the panels for the contents of the shelf or the room its going to live in
273873 if everyone did things like this wed be less inclined to throw things out and the world would be enriched because wherever you went youd be walking into environments that are empowered by peoples history and creativity
273874 we never seriously considered doing anything except selling until a broker suggested we take the equity out of our existing home buy another house and rent out the old house until the market turns around
273875 when the market really fell out last year we decided to take his advice
273876 about 15 of the national landlord market is new to landlording in the past two years
273877 the value of my home has dropped to 450 000
273878 so ive decided to hang on and lease it out but im having a hard time finding a renter
273879 so it might cost us to rent them now but its worth it to take that loss and make money later down the road
273880 there are tenants out there looking for naive landlords who will rent to them but have no intention of paying the rent
273881 so its incredibly important for landlords to go through the initial procedures of having the tenant fill out an application and go over it with a fine tooth comb
273882 we came here and just fell in love with the house
273883 theres not a lot you need to or can do to it
273884 its rough cut red cedar and we find it beautiful
273885 we wanted to play off the wood walls and soften the feel
273886 i love the exaggerated chesterfield tufting and the fastening bolts and carabiners so you can reconfigure it into a pit or anything else we collected these pieces from around the world i love how the softness of them plays off the clean lines of the room
273887 it was a great old kitchen but it had some things that were hard for us
273888 we were torn the original heath tile was beautiful but we needed to increase our counter space storage space and make room for modern appliances
273889 we wanted to try to use the products fickett would have used
273890 the only place we varied that was for the countertops
273891 i also want to mention ted grintjes the suddenly maligned chair of the 27 th street steering committee i dont know him that well but i know of him franklin owes a lot of gratitude to him for his work in getting northwestern mutual life and wheaton franciscan here i would remind everyone that this man is a volunteer giving countless hours of his time and expertise i do hope he doesnt get frustrated and continues on because if he should step away and im not suggesting thats a possibility in any way shape or form franklin would be hard pressed to find a replacement with his institutional knowledge or volunteer time for that matter

273909 there are some very important serious infrastructure and systems being built right now at yahoo that we think allows us to compete over time
273910 we think that we are the better operating company and we think were going to make it
273911 weve had a couple of last minute bugs and some tweaks to do when trophies become involved you have start ensuring that cheating is prevented or at least made harder so thereve been a few things like that that have slowed things down

273934 en la puesta en marcha de este plan desestabilizador impulsado por el gobierno de george w bush se suele utilizar a personajes como pe a cuya filiaci n pol tica es de extrema derecha para lograr sus objetivos que en este caso es el desprestigio internacional tanto del gobierno como de las instituciones venezolanas
273935 es un pretexto utilizado con miras a justificar medidas pol ticas jur dicas econ micas y eventualmente militares contra venezuela
273936 debemos estar conscientes recalc el diputado de que los recursos naturales que posee venezuela tanto energ ticos como minerales y acu feros est n en la mira del imperialismo norteamericano

273947 facebreaker was eas attempt at bringing fun games like ready to rumble over to the next gen well they have done it except its without the fun

274178 im sorry my teaching style isnt for you maybe these other classes would suit you better
274179 your pants are a lttle tight and you have on way too much make up
274180 dont worry it takes time to master this isolation its not easy
274181 you just did so well what a difference a week of practice makes huh i mean seriously you just carried the group in zils
274182 so and so i am afraid i have some bad news i am sorry to do this but i am giving you the full semesters refund b c i think our time together as student and teacher has come to a close we have had to have a one on one already once about things that you say that may adversely affect others in class then i had to email you about a similar situation and i got no reply
274183 and unfortunately in the past few months a few of your classmates let me know they are uncomfortable with dancing with you they find some of what you say to be hurtful and it is as if you have an air that you know more than they do
274184 now i know you arent a mean spirited person and i know you to be nice but you tend to blurt tings out not realizing how what you say can be taken by others
274185 im going to have to stop you here b c this is a bit of what i refer to rather than take the words you are hearing much like critiques in classes and sit with them awhile to see how they may ring true or how you could gain more awareness you choose to stand here and defend yourself and argue the points you asked me to make rather than listen and reflect and hopefully arrive at why some of the students and myself may have these feelings you are getting a defensive posture arms crossed chin down scowl and arguing with me so lets get back to the real matter i dont think i am the best teacher for you at this point in your classes i know zils are frustrating to you she had just re mentioned that as one of the reasons she was pissy and so if you would like i am happy to recommend other teachers in fact some dont even teach zils

274192 captain climate had a sidekick boy atmosphere but when he tried to approach gore at the last debate the campaign had its volunteers surround us with a cordon of supporters so no one could see us
274193 writing letters making phone calls organizing neighborhood campaigns average americans can have a strong impact on policy
274194 but until enough citizens who are voters care then these special interests will be able to block any meaningful policy change its as simple as that

274216 el hecho de que los militares extranjeros se involucren en acciones humanitarias y controlen zonas concretas del pa s impide que el gobierno pueda establecerse y generar confianza en esas regiones
274217 y la desorganizaci n entre los distintos actores hace muy f cil que los insurgentes tomen posiciones

274337 a puff of steam and the sweet toot of the whistle announces to the world that the peppercorn a1 is back from the dead and with it the last great locomotive is about to make a dramatic return to the track considering the intervening centuries since the technology was perfected a period during which man has created flying machines that would take him to the moon and beyond it seems perhaps a little surprising that the sounding of a locomotive whistle on a grey summers day in co durham should provide such excitement but when it comes to steam trains and the passions they invoke among those who obsess about chronicle and love these coal fired kings of the permanent way with a searing intensity rules governing human expectations do not apply here i must express a declaration of interest my great uncle bert drove the flying scotsman on the kings cross to grantham leg of its daily run to edinburgh serving his final days as a driver of the mighty a1 to me uncle bert was a family legend he began his career shortly after the first world war cleaning and oiling the machines idolised by every young boy in edwardian britain eventually working his way up from to fireman to driver bert revelled in his status express train drivers were the glamorous aristocrats of the working classes in truth he would have driven them for nothing and spoke of little else except trains at least to the children who gathered eagerly round to listen to his stories of life on the footplate

274382 in order for economic development to take place in any given location the very first thing required before anything else can possibly happen is information this information includes first and foremost where to look for the necessary resources to do anything if new businesses are needed knowing they are needed and finding funding for them are two very different things the first step is to locate possible capital resources in order to move forward and this step is no more and no less than information once resources are located the next step is what terms and conditions are involved in obtaining those resources more information once this is known paperwork must be completed business plans made market research and due diligence conducted and all of this compiled and forwarded to the appropriate parties again nothing more than information in fact most of the work involved between identifying a need and solving the problem is information acquisition and management getting and developing information as alvin toffler predicted in power shift where once violence and then wealth were dominant forms of power information is now becoming the dominant power those nations with the greatest freedom of information and means of transmitting it have now become the most powerful and influential and the strongest economically toffler also predicted the collapse of the soviet union would come about due primarily to its authoritarian control and limiting of information unfortunately for russian citizens this old habit has continued for them beyond the collapse of the former soviet union and will at the least make an interesting case study on the survivability of a once strong nation which still remains committed to limiting and controlling information by going with the normal flow of free market enterprise and the emerging replacement of monetary capital with intellectual capital as the dominant form of basic enterprise capitalization it becomes easier to set up new companies primarily on the basis of invested intellectual capital see post capitalist society by peter drucker in plain english socially responsible and forward thinking companies can be set up quickly and cheaply and these companies have indefinite potential for earnings and localized targeted economic development the initial objective is to develop model enterprises and communities then implement successful strategies from those models into surrounding communities regionwide or nationwide as needed with an initial p ced business enterprise set up in a given community it becomes possible to bring people into the fold so to speak of the information age no existing company need change anything whatsoever about how it does business new web development software development and information management enterprises for example can be set up quickly for extremely low seed capital outlays existing businesses who need web software development and management services can have their business readily enhanced for costs that are relatively insignificant compared to increased viability and long term profitability of entering into a much broader marketplace without a brick being laid the design firm wins the existing business wins most importantly the community at large wins by way of decreased poverty and unemployment since the design firms profits for the most part go back into the community for adult education or retraining high tech head start programs for underprivileged children seeding new small businesses and social relief along the way the design firms employees benefit from good wages profit sharing and normal benefit packages well paid employees in effect produce inevitably highly desirable social and community outcomes in short everyone benefits in that this new enterprise effectively becomes a primary node and locus of much needed information for the community it is appropriate to seek seed capital to start the enterprise from traditional development and aid funding sources the result is a self sustaining and self perpetuating enterprise that feeds on the very need or demand for resources that hampered the community and its people to begin with
274383 the beauty of wikis is collaboration it will be interesting to see if collaborative efforts can provide useful information concerning the 2008 presidential election

274400 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
274401 using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues
274402 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
274403 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
274404 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
274405 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky

274412 we agreed last year that 2008 would be an investment year and we had to improve our financial position considerably in 2009 i want to be very clear the board controlled the process of the microsoft bid we led from the front the 1 priority was to maximize shareholder value that was all we talked about in the 30 odd board meetings we had during that period there was never any doubt to our openness to doing a deal with microsoft nsdq msft we never resisted microsofts proposal despite rumors on the contrary during this period we encouraged microsoft to be even more engaged the result was that they reduced their engagement level and even thought of lowering the bid in an offhand comment to one of the board members they said that there may be a few more dollars on the table it was never communicated formally to the board or came to us in writing
274413 and i tell you folks it was hell of a burden to deal with all these offers we were within our targets in first quarter of 208 we were on target in the second quarter of 2008 their performance was astounding

274491 the first trademark application was made in 1998 under serial number 75291765 by netcentric corporation a company that used to provide
274492 the government doesnt mind revealing that information to detainees because it doesnt plan ever to release them
274493 ill just go to disk utility and reformat the drive all will be well
274494 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
274495 it was them talking about security engineering and how they take security seriously
274496 due to circumstances beyond my control i regret that i will not be able to participate in black hat this year
274497 discriminatory and not narrowly tailored to address comcasts concern about network congestion
274498 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
274499 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
274500 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
274501 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
274502 the fact is the fcc does not know what comcast did and did not do
274503 ironically todays decision may result in slow speeds for 95 percent of internet users
274504 if we arent going to stop a company that is looking inside its subscribers communications blocking that communication when it uses a particular application regardless of whether there is congestion on the network hiding what it is doing by making consumers think the problem is their own and lying about it to the public what would we stop
274505 they knowingly and willfully joined the same conspiracy with the same objective
274506 es ist ein ehrgeiziges und poliert aufwand sehr sch n f r das auge
274507 this is huge its a giant step but its not enough to ensure that internet users are protected
274508 is the next step for the fcc to mandate that network owners must ask the government for permission before serving their customers by managing surges of information flow
274509 as a result of todays actions internet lawyers around the country are likely advising their clients to do just that
274510 we dont know if this is going to be crippling or really damaging
274511 foot in the door for big government to regulate the internet
274512 now that they have that foot in the door i fully expect that it will be exploited for everything its worth to grow the scope of the fccs coercive bureaucratic authority over all things digital
274513 for their superior understanding of the need to check monopoly and duopoly isps who attempt to act as online gatekeepers and for their historic and courageous action today
274514 stopping discriminatory network management practices is important to the flow of information in our democracy and to the economic growth that is made possible by an open internet
274515 regardless of how one views the merits of the complaint against comcast the fcc today has shown that its national internet policies work and that they are more than sufficient for handling any net neutrality concerns that may arise
274516 basically opencl lets you use graphics processors to do computation
274517 have different architectures pin outs and mechanical electrical and thermal characteristics
274518 i am proud to add my name as well to the list of those who support the aims and principles of the education equality project
274519 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
274520 the education equality project is a practical plan for delivering change and restoring hope for children and parents who need a lot of both and if senator obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
274521 i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
274522 enormous good into the life of our country by broadening the reach of economic opportunity
274523 eine medaille in peking w re geil sie ist drin wenn alles klappt

274525 die gegend sieht heute wahrscheinlich noch so aus wie south hampton in new york vor 50 jahren
274526 dieses haus mit seinen g rten war jahrelang eine grosse leidenschaft f r mich
274527 ich habe zeit und arbeitsaufwand hineingesteckt um dies zu einem ort zu machen in den sich die menschen verlieben k nnen genauso wie es mir ergangen ist
274528 jetzt wo wir beide allein sind brauchen wir nicht mehr all den platz den dieses haus bietet
274529 aber wir lieben diese gegend so sehr dass wir auf einem nahe gelegenen grundst ck ein kleineres haus gebaut haben einfach nur damit wir hier bleiben k nnen ich hoffe dass irgendjemand anderes jetzt dieses haus und das was es zu bieten hat sch tzen wird wundersch ne natur friedliche gr nfl chen und ein haus das man das ganze jahr ber geniessen kann
274530 dies ist eine hervorragende gelegenheit f r uns mit wunderbaren eigent mern zusammenzuarbeiten und ihnen dabei zu helfen wirklich aussergew hnliche immobilien zu verkaufen
274531 diese anwesen und das dazugeh rige land bieten wunderbare einzigartige details von der aufwendigen architektur bis hin zu eleganten atemberaubend sch nen g rten und wegen es war uns von vornherein klar dass hier alles zutiefst gepflegt und gehegt wurde in der hoffnung dass diese gegend noch viele weitere generationen lang bewundert werden wird
274532 im falle einer niederlage werden wir unsere starke anteilsposition ausbauen
274533 wir k nnen den aufsichtsrat nicht zwingen aber wir k nnen uns nicht vorstellen dass er dann nicht handeln wird
274534 zudem setzte sich die negative interpretation der us arbeitsmarktdaten und des ism index durch general motors war sowieso ein desaster
274535 schalke ist f r uns nicht der beste aber auch nicht der schlechteste gegner
274536 wir gehen optimistisch in die spiele tatsache ist dass das r ckspiel in madrid ist und das ist ein vorteil f r uns
274537 i really want to hire you but i have to check with my boss ill call you early next week
274538 id like to give you the opportunity to let me guest post on your blog
274539 because prominent world leaders like you became utterly selfish people far far beyond the normal allowable limits with highly deplorable dont care attitude

274545 experienced exhaustion dizziness shortness of breath and other signs of extreme fatigue that were ignored by trainers and or coaches of the university of central florida
274546 as a direct and proximate result of the university of central floridas negligence ereck plancher collapsed and died
274547 the plancher family has been frustrated by the fact that they have not been able to get an accurate account of what happened during the conditioning drills on march 18 they feel very strongly that they do not want any other families to go through what they are going through
274548 the health of our student athletes is our top priority and we provide superb medical care at ucf
274549 we have received the notice of claim per university policy we do not comment on matters that are in pending litigation
274550 we have said repeatedly that ereck passed all of his physicals and was cleared to participate fully by ucf team physicians our staff advised ereck of his sickle cell trait and monitored his physical condition at every practice and workout
274551 predisposed to sickling of the red blood cells during periods of physical stress
274552 were looking to match the quality of the original version
274553 we want to make sure that the water is just as great and i think you can see from the demonstration that it looks no different from the 360 version
274554 before this was the best place but now its like a prison when i watch tv everything is lies so i walk in the streets where the soldiers ask for my identity papers if theres the smallest mistake youre finished we should be tolerant but we cant be tolerant any more
274555 broke down five doors checked everything threw it all on the floor and hit everyone present it was like a burglary
274556 at first i thought they were going to kill me they gave us half a steamed bun a day everyone was very thirsty and a lot of people drank their own urine we had no clothes no blankets nothing to lie down on and it was very cold for four days nobody spoke to us they just left us there
274557 im very worried about the monks the soldiers regard them as something very different i cant understand why they do terrible things to monks
274558 i met an old man who had two ribs broken
274559 afterwards he said that hed done all kinds of things that happens to a lot of people they pressure people to admit things they never did many questions were asked of people who are not guilty of anything they are just guilty of being tibetan
274560 i have a relative in india i wrote just what i heard and saw to send over the internet i wrote a little and saved it on word all of a sudden it disappeared so i was very frightened so i havent checked my e mail i have a lot of friends abroad and they send many e mails but i havent opened them
274561 in prison i sometimes dreamed about food i would remember my mothers and my sisters cooking and i really appreciated how tasty the food is at home
274562 these are the worst things that ive ever seen in my life
274563 unfortunately today we have no presence in new york and thats owing to some of the financial and technical pressures that have already been alluded to
274564 certainly we hope that situation changes in the near term were quite bullish about the new york market
274565 nyserda has enough funds left for the program to fund about three weeks they spent 700 000 last week theyve got like a total of 16 000 000 available and itll be gone within the month
274566 the complexities of putting these tax incentives and rebates together depending on who you are and what you do are you a for profit coop or a nonprofit condo it becomes very complex
274567 i can pretty well qualify that we dont have what buckner described happening any time soon
274568 theres been an uptick in solar interests for business and personal use weve been planning money for a ramp up in available renewals
274569 the big hold up has been the high interest in solar energy renewal its been hard to keep up with the demand and with all the application forms
274570 nyserda is the primary vehicle for the state to implement energy policy
274571 it has a really broad variety of activities including building infrastructure for future energy policies
274572 the challenge is theres this gap between what the subsidies add up to and what the companies are willing to pay
274573 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
274574 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
274575 what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
274576 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
274577 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
274578 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
274579 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
274580 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
274581 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
274582 the hands that once picked cotton can now pick a president
274583 i knew two other people who had gone through the program and i went on their web site to research the course
274584 the program taught us how to resource information in order to help other people garden especially in the area of growing food they teach us about pest control fertilizers seeds plants every aspect of gardening
274585 you can practically grow a garden in a gallon container or a bucket things like tomatoes onions and peppers grow almost anywhere and need very little water right now in my garden im trying to grow corn and i have a few melons onions peppers and cucumbers
274586 there was a time when black people grew most of their food
274587 i think we should go back to that because it can help us economically in the long run
274588 here it comes the mott hasnt won a race at the meet stories
274589 ive had horses run their butts off probably as good as they could run
274590 shes coming off a good race well take a shot to get a little grade 1 black type
274591 it was firm turf but it rained and it was a little slippery and his hind end scooted out from under him around the turn and he never got his action back
274592 i thought it would it have been around 40 percent withheld i thought it would be more than last year
274593 i have no problem with yahoo as a company i have a problem with the board
274594 we just came from the go team and it was really cool
274595 i like to hear everything the headliners get people out but the other side is coming out and checking out new stuff
274596 we mainly made the trip for rage against the machine
274597 i would happily do 8 years in prison for a crime i didnt commit if it will make a millionaire which it certainly will for this particular simpleton
274598 what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
274599 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
274600 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
274601 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
274602 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying

274604 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
274605 the hands that once picked cotton can now pick a president
274606 he got a significant sum of money a substantial amount to live comfortably for the rest of his life
274607 mr rockefeller is an avid internet user and we feel he could be checking up on the search he used to have an email using the name rockefeller but i imagine he has a new name now
274608 clark although many things have changed you will always be reighs father and i will always be reighs mother
274609 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests at heart i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
274610 reigh honey i love you and miss you so much remember youre always a princess
274611 he is not a rockefeller he has zero money she was his enabler
274612 he had a high society accent but sometimes he sounded as if he came from canada when i pulled him up on the fact he did not go to yale university he just shrugged and said whatever as though he wanted to be caught out
274613 i made a mistake the suitcase was supposed to fall in the river if it had fallen in the river nobody would have found it as they havent found the head and the other parts
274614 an essential preparatory step in the plan to bring death and destruction to the heart of the uk
274615 this was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
274616 spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
274617 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
274618 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
274619 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
274620 can you hear me the program is closed we have sent letters to all cardholders
274621 i am amazed at the lengths that jerry yang and the board went to entrench themselves in this situation
274622 we have seen tremendous progress being made on the fight against hiv aids but i think even to applaud those numbers might be a little bit premature
274623 we see that theres still 2 million people a year who are dying from hiv aids and the total number of people receiving new infections each year is still continuing to rise
274624 we havent made announcements on that front frankly its original design was all about the control of the wii wand but there are other ways to implement that it is a hugely innovative product i expect youll see it on other platforms in time
274625 the gathering made a marked change in many of those who attended
274626 you could see it in their faces they were empowered by acquiring the skills to publish their information and to tell and share their stories without an intermediary
274627 i feel there is a maturation process taking place among journalists in the departments
274628 they are beginning to claim their place in guatemalan journalism good young committed periodistas are emerging who may change the face of information within and outside this country
274629 they live in communities and rural areas which are remote from universities offering the msw since they have jobs and family or community commitments in their home towns relocating or commuting to a distance university was impossible
274630 one student who began her graduate studies in an on campus program for instance had a child with physical problems who needed her full time care at home

274632 many of the students in this program are the first in their families to attend college since a number of the social work faculty are also first generation college students they are alert to the special issues facing first generation students

274634 a big one john that last batch of carbon paper was not up to snuff write a memo to the head of supply read his beads
274635 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
274636 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
274637 i felt good the ball was coming out pretty nice i was very happy with the way i threw

274645 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
274646 we hope to be able to answer the question of whether this was a habitable zone on mars it will be for future missions to find if anyone is home on this environment
274647 move from looking for water to seeing whether there were habitats for life
274648 we are moving towards understanding whether there were or could be places on mars that are habitable

274660 as a semi custom home builder we know that theres no one size fits all when it comes to a customers home and we extend that thinking to our incentives
274661 together with the non temporary charges taken in previous periods these additional charges to our bond portfolios are intended to reflect managements current views as to their value taking into consideration both our near and long term concerns regarding the absence of liquidity and the extreme volatility of the markets in which the bonds trade managements assessment and determination of the appropriate charges is further based on an ongoing comprehensive review and stress analysis of the underlying real estate collateral supporting our bond portfolio finally rather than characterizing current market reductions as either temporary or non temporary charges management has now elected in all cases to characterize all of the existing charges as non temporary charges in view of our expressed concerns relating to long term bond market conditions the reserves to our loan portfolio similarly reflect our current viewpoint as to these two particular loans in the context of overall real estate market conditions

274669 this milestone is a demonstration of the success of the collaboration between ge aviation and pratt amp whitney
274670 the entire engine alliance team looks forward to continuing to work closely with emirates to ensure a smooth entry into service
274671 congress has the power to mend not end downpayment assistance funded in part by sellers
274672 more than 100 000 hard working families and individuals many of them women and minorities depend on these programs annually to become homeowners i introduced this bipartisan legislation to preserve access to homeownership while protecting the fhas solvency i thank my colleagues financial services chairman barney frank housing subcommittee chairwoman maxine waters and reps gary miller and christopher shays for their support of this important legislation and for recognizing that the next generation of homeowners is counting on this program
274673 the recent housing bill may have slammed the door on working families but we are heartened that congress has begun to take steps to re open it u s representatives al green gary miller maxine waters and christopher shays understand what is at stake for working families and have proposed common sense constructive reforms to put them back on the path to homeownership we strongly support their efforts to re authorize and reform charitable downpayment assistance
274674 i believe the agreement is good for india and good for the world
274675 will welcome india into the non proliferation mainstream and assist india in meeting its growing energy needs in an environmentally friendly way
274676 will be to proceed to the nuclear suppliers group nsg where we hope to move quickly on revising the guidelines that will enable civil nuclear cooperation with india before submitting the agreement for congressional approval later this year
274677 we are of course approaching all friendly countries but we do hope that the nsg will similarly grant a clean unconditional exemption for india
274678 the deal is certainly important for india but its also important for the world at large because i think it meets the twin objectives of energy security as well as global climate change related issues and concerns
274679 france has long supported the development of civil nuclear cooperation with india
274680 and the concrete result of that i hope will be a comprehensive moratorium by all states that have nuclear weapons not to test them at any time in the future
274681 this process appears to be proof of a willingness to respect european legislation which we appreciate
274682 we are now going to examine with the utmost care the documents that have been transmitted to us
274683 six people have been killed and seven have been wounded
274684 a mortar platoon of the georgian defence ministry is purposefully shelling the southern part of tskhinvali the northern outskirts of the city are being fired upon as well
274685 our response to tbilisis aggressive actions will be very tough and hard hitting
274686 we reserve the right to strike georgian cities we have something that can reach them
274687 the ossetians opened fire including with grenade launchers and the georgian side only returned fire
274688 we are able to confirm that substantial progress has been made in the investigation by bringing to bear new and sophisticated scientific tools
274689 we are unable to provide additional information at this time
274690 for more than a year we have been privileged to represent dr bruce ivins during the investigation of the anthrax deaths of september and october of 2001
274691 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
274692 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
274693 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death we ask that the media respect the privacy of his family and allow them to grieve
274694 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
274695 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
274696 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
274697 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
274698 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations
274699 we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
274700 we are less concerned with their public comments than we are with actions on the ground in china
274701 were still only two thirds of the way through earnings season so people will be focused on that
274702 generally investors have felt relieved that the earnings have continued to be better than expected realizing of course that the bar had been set awfully low
274703 we have the fed meeting but i am not expecting any big reaction to that i think the market is going to stay in a fairly well constrained trading range and is going to move up and down with daily movements in oil
274704 if you look at the financials they have been surprisingly strong despite the volatility in the market you see citigroup getting its act together and certainly merrill doing house cleaning
274705 pratt amp whitney took voluntary and immediate actions to remedy a problem suffered by our customer we do not agree with the doj allegations
274706 we are demanding the removal of the president and new parliamentary and presidential elections
274707 i can only express an opinion the law must be respected
274708 for all citizens and of course the head of the government this individual generates a perfectly understandable feeling of contempt but we must respect the law
274709 its not pressure so much from the outside as knowing that you have to contribute or you are letting the team down
274710 today was very special everything went my way and its a day i wont forget its been tough over the past couple of months

274713 were going to have really make it work fast for us
274714 the games on a knife edge we had an opportunity today which we didnt take we forgot about everything weve spoken about today
274715 but weve got that second opportunity with the new ball the wickets flat there wasnt a huge amount of spin on offer and it didnt swing much today when the sun was out
274716 we believe we can chase down most totals on that but its going to be difficult
274717 i thought about it but it took me all day to get this lead and i wasnt about to slow down at the end and give him a gift
274718 i prefer to keep the time and see what happens tomorrow
274719 its always very fast here but im more confident than last year
274720 there was nothing more i could do in there it was perfect tomorrow is going to be a long but very interesting day and i cant wait to get back in the car
274721 i need to take a nap i am tired and if i dont i am about to go off on you

274730 this was the most difficult milestone in development of the falcon 9 launch vehicle and it also constitutes a significant achievement in us space vehicle development not since the final flight of the saturn 1b rocket in 1975 has a rocket had the ability to lose any engine or motor and still successfully complete its mission
274731 much like a commercial airliner our multi engine design has the potential to provide significantly higher reliability than single engine
274732 all phases of integration went smoothly and we were elated to see all nine engines working perfectly in concert

274735 o professor de esportes da minha escola era aberto e sincero fui atra da a ele por seu modo de viver como ser humano n o por um futuro relacionamento ele tinha alguma coisa que eu n o havia visto na vida de meus pais ou irm os existia nele alguma coisa que eu n o compreendia ent o comecei a perguntar a ele sobre isso de uma maneira muito cautelosa quando ele percebeu meu interesse em religi o e no cristianismo me deu uma pequena b blia para ler e isso me abriu os olhos
274736 o professor se referiu cruz para mim me deu uma b blia secretamente que comecei a ler e estudar imediatamente ele tamb m me apontou programas de r dio como boas maneiras de fazer estudos b blicos j que ele n o poderia faz lo comigo
274737 foi ent o que comecei ouvindo os programas de r dio por tr s meses ent o decidi me tornar crist e seguir cristo mas como eu poderia fazer isso olhei para um pr dio com uma cruz do outro lado da minha cidade e cuidadosamente comecei a visitar essa igreja sem o v u e sem ser reconhecida pelas pessoas
274738 in the last historical battle it was to wage anarchism was to see all the ideological sauce that comprised its being fall back into its face state freedom individual and other musty ingredients with capital letters while the libertarian militias workers and peasants were saving its honor making the greatest practical contribution ever to the international proletarian movement burning churches fighting on all fronts against the bourgeoisie fascism and stalinism and beginning to create a truly communist society
274739 for franco to be defeated first companys and caballero had to be defeated for fascism to be wiped out first the bourgeoisie and its stalinist and socialist allies had to be crushed the capitalist state had to be destroyed from top to bottom and workers power based on rank and file committees be installed antifascist unity has just been submission to the bourgeoisie
274740 feels like some kind of ride but its turning out just to be life going absolutely perfectly
274741 iran is continuing to advance toward a military nuclear capability and is heading towards a major breakthrough
274742 for us such a situation that iran will have a nuclear power is an existential threat and from the state of israel point of view it is unacceptable
274743 our estimation is that already by 2009 iran will reach enrichment capability and as soon as 2010 will have option to reach uranium production at military levels
274744 one thing is clear is iranians are continuing their policy of buying time and so far they are succeeding
274745 we all know time is a decisive element in our ability to change the picture and remove the iranian threat

274801 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
274802 and the limits to growth when i was at cornell but i hadnt had a lot of imagination around how things would play out for people as we started sliding down that energy descent curve

274812 by using miscanthus we can produce ethanol using a lot less land than were using at present doing this with corn
274813 one reason why miscanthus yields more biomass than corn is that it produces green leaves about six weeks earlier in the growing season
274814 in the context of global change thats important because it means that by producing a biofuel on that land youre taking carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it into the soil
274815 im open sourcing this to let everybody run with it
274816 my plan is that when people see it theyll see its easy to do and theyll start working it

274836 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
274837 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
274838 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
274839 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
274840 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
274841 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue
274842 realistically that track did something that weve never seen it do before and thats not take rubber
274843 that is somehow different from what we experienced in 06 and 07
274844 the whole combination of that tire the car of tomorrow on that racetrack caused that right rear tire to wear like we had never seen before the fronts were similar to what we had seen in 06 and 07 the wear improved on the front but the rear never got any better

274851 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
274852 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
274853 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
274854 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
274855 riding a recumbent is like trying to explain to somebody what its like to look out on some big mountain in montana
274856 if you aint been there its hard to explain it
274857 when i first got one everybody out here in the country thought i was crazy
274858 now you see whats happened a bunch of people out here in our little community have them too
274859 you get the same benefits as a diamond frame bike you just use different muscles and they are a lot more comfortable
274860 we sell more of them but price is the reason why sales havent gone wild
274861 there is also a tendency to have a little more maintenance on a recumbent because you shift them more
274862 over the last 12 to 15 years there have been a ream of studies on the danger of the standard bicycle saddle
274863 its not so much the shape of the saddle as it is the shape of the body over the saddle for riders that ride more than three hours a week it can lead to erectile dysfunction for men and numbness for women
274864 once i saw the clips i instantly called the st louis team
274865 they hooked me up and took me under their wing and from then its been nothing but rugby
274866 im a huge barbecue person if i have the grill outside im going to be eating red meat
274867 for breakfast usually i have bowl of cereal lunchtime its a sandwich for dinner its a hamburger
274868 its the college student diet too so its the same thing over and over
274869 i workout three to four times a week in the gym and we practice four to five days a week with the university of arizona team its quite a few hours a week spent in the gym
274870 for the paralympic team they let us practice on our own once you get to that stage they let you train on your own but there are guidelines
274871 i dont like the canyons but the ridges and peaks
274872 the caley couple also have done the 54 colorado peaks of 14 000 or more feet and now are into whats going down
274873 its for the goal oriented for anybody and any pace
274874 you look at a mountain and you determine to get there we see part of the wild the beauty of it most will never see
274875 i was hiking in the catalinas and sitting on a rock when some people came by and told me about the hiking club
274876 i like to go from there and find my way up

274878 we are going to make a big big difference in the american marketplace
274879 we are ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need to do their job
274880 toxic chemicals like lead and phthalates have no business in our childrens toys
274881 safety testing and certification for such hazards as powerful magnets before products are sold a ban on lead and phthalates and more will helpfully put an end to the recalls of childrens products and the horror stories that lead to those recalls

274886 a lot of degrading things said about the city of canton for somebody whos probably never been to kansas let alone canton

274890 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza
274891 in seniors flu vaccine was not linked to a reduced risk of pneumonia
274892 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza
274893 however earlier studies have overestimated how well the vaccine works in reducing complications of influenza so the vaccine may not reduce the risk of complications as much as previously thought
274894 when you look at the total population of seniors which includes people older than 75 and people that have chronic health diseases lung disease heart disease diabetes and things like that we dont know if the vaccine is effective in the seniors
274895 people with these chronic diseases are more susceptible to getting the flu and they are more likely to develop pneumonia if they do get influenza
274896 we know that elderly people do not form sufficient antibodies to certain vaccines the flu vaccine included
274897 in addition people in their 70s and 80s and 90s are more prone to pneumonia with or without influence a number of these pneumonias may be secondary to other causes aside from influenza
274898 having many people vaccinated builds up a herd immunity to disease and you create barriers to transmission
274899 we give the flu shot primarily to prevent elderly deaths
274900 in the best years the flu vaccine is really only 40 to 60 percent effective
274901 there are plenty of flu related complications that are life threatening besides pneumonia

274928 the movie has manifold pleasures as much for the interplay of mulder and scully the soulmates who were afraid to become lovers as for a story that concentrates on human not astral malfeasance
274929 the movie has manifold pleasures for the shows fans as much for the interplay of mulder and scully the soulmates who were afraid to become lovers as for a story that concentrates on human not astral malfeasance but for the uninitiated the x files i want to believe may seem as musty and forbidding as one of those dank secrets that mulder and scully were forever digging up from some backyard or fetid swamp or their own aching hearts
274930 todays moviegoers will have to forgo expectations of wisecracking heroes and snarling psychopaths and to take seriously a couple of anguished folks who look and behave with the tired tenseness of anchors on c span which is why this weekend perhaps four times as many moviegoers will take in the dark knight on its second weekend as will see mulder and scully on their first date in six years director chris carter has underlined that this is a stand alone story indeed the film feels like a middling two parter from the old show
274931 while step brothers the latest effort from adam mckay anchorman talladega nights is clearly just an excuse to get will ferrell and john c reilly behaving like spoiled brats for 90 minutes it nonetheless results in a perfectly funny movie
274932 considering how close the last two presidential elections were including the 2000 race between gore and bush that came down to hanging chads and the supreme court it was probably inevitable that filmmakers would find a credible way to focus on a campaign that somehow comes down to just one vote if you can accept that premise youll have a great time with swing vote which manages to be so funny and ultimately inspiring you may just want to stand up and cheer
274933 finally the terrific actress melissa leo gets her place in the sun
274934 if frozen river finally gets the terrific actress melissa leo her place in the sun to boot so much the better
274935 like many first features that began life as shorts and were shot over two weeks with a varicam frozen river can be ragged viewing director courtney hunts a bit free with the thin ice as metaphor and slathered on pathos and the movie careens uncertainly between gritty realism sudden bursts of melodrama and inspiration too many bad things happen then too many good things and i took bets with myself on the precise arrival time of the flowering of female solidarity between these two tigresses risking all for their cubs that it comes on cue in a rushed climax only takes away from leos powerfully direct evocation of rays aloneness the way she grows so hard and cold with the grind of trying to survive day in day out and her willingness to get what she needs off the backs of others if necessary
274936 while elegantly mounted and well acted the movie is not the equal of the tv production in part because so much material had to be compressed into such a shorter time it is also not the equal of the recent film atonement which in an oblique way touches on similar issues but it is a good sound example of the british period drama mid range merchant ivory you could say
274937 fascinating queasy making new documentary the fascination comes from how unguarded these young people seem to be about their own lives speaking frankly to the camera and allowing it to observe uncomfortable and intimate moments in their lives the queasiness inevitably arises from the same source it goes without saying that a documentary film that finds non famous non adult people at an especially vulnerable crux in their lives is something of an ethical minefield can a filmmaker investigate the sexual emotional and family lives of innocent youngsters without slipping into exploitation the easy answer confirmed by american teen is no way and why even try in a project like this one the line between sympathy and prurience is not so much thin as nonexistent once we know a little about how these kids think interact and behave we are caught between the hunger to know everything and the impulse to look away before we learn too much
274938 this is the kind of movie the people in it might have made which means that its revelatory power as an investigation of teenage life in america is limited it tweaks but does not entirely satisfy your desire to see the alleged typicality of the warsaw high seniors deepened into a source of social insight matters of class come up only obliquely and parents are largely in the shadows and when they emerge they are reliably clueless bumbling and unsympathetic they have the double disadvantage of being grown ups in a teen movie and of being compared with their children less intuitively aware of what it means to parade before the camera on screen living an ordinary american life
274939 american teen a documentary set in small town indiana effectively captures the highs lows and in betweens in a way that feels authentic despite occasional obvious staging though it could work as effectively as a television vehicle american teen is revealing funny and involving
274940 there is as much to repel as there is to allure and i cannot imagine leaving a screening of it in anything less than two minds

274950 ach die tussi tut doch so als k nne sie es mit jedem aufnehmen nur weil sie judo macht denkt sie das sie was besseres sei
274951 ach ich wei nicht ok damals auf der klassenfahrt da also eigentlich begann alles im sportunterricht wir sollten in dieser stunde bodenturnen machen als wir die matten gerade aufgebaut hatten wurde unsere lehrerin dringend ans telefon gerufen und unsere klasse war f r eine viertelstunde allein in der halle in der zeit begannen maria und mike dass ist der kleine rothaarige sich ein wenig zu raufen auf den turnmatten
274952 na ja die maria hat ihn halt sehr zur belustigung aller ganz sch n fertig gemacht zuerst hat sie ihn mehrfach umhergeschleudert und anschlie end hat sie ihn am boden gehalten bis die lehrerin wiederkam und die beiden auseinander gezogen hat mike hatte keine chance gegen maria ok dass war wirklich gut
274953 die klassenfahrt war dann ein paar wochen sp ter an einem abend als wir freizeit hatten begannen die jungs ein armwrestling turnier jeder der wollte durfte mitmachen als maria das mitbekam wollte sie auch mitmachen zuerst lachte die jungs noch ber sie und wollten sie nicht mitmachen lassen
274954 doch maria wollte unbedingt mitmachen und sie schlug vor zuerst nur ein match gegen mike zu machen wenn sie gewinnen w rde d rfte sie mitmachen w rde sie verlieren dann nicht nat rlich hat sie gewonnen gegen mike
274955 ziemlich weit maria hat nur gegen lars und ali verloren die anderen hat sie alle besiegt das waren immerhin acht jungs gegen die sie gewonnen hat deshalb haben gestern abend alle so gelacht seit dem hat sie den spitznamen muckie

274958 giving women access to modern contraception and family planning also helps to boost economic growth while reducing high birth rates so strongly linked with endemic poverty poor education and high numbers of maternal and infant deaths
274959 hundreds of women are dying every day in poor countries from botched abortions
274960 by repeatedly cutting the budget for international family planning and putting in place the global gag rule the supposedly pro life bush administration ignores this tragic reality and without doubt causes more unsafe abortions posing high costs to women their families and society at large
274961 completely expand the federal abortion refusal laws to include some of the most commonly used forms of contraception

274964 for winning the local country showdown sponsored by kygo at the electric cowboy on wed july 30th the band will now advance to the colorado state final on saturday september 6th at cowboys in colorado springs
274965 you two dont try to blend in much do you
274966 i dont give a damn what kind of special right you think you possess but it hardly qualifies you to even begin to ponder in what we are
274967 perhaps you should change your tone mr woods dont you know who i am
274968 of course not i do my job secretly and thats something you both need to understand you think just because your good at something it gives you the right to judge on what isnt
274969 we know exactly who you are your name is benjamin hade a professional assassin for the government who has never failed to kill someone once ordered you give free trips to hell every time and my question to your question is just because society claims someone must be killed that makes your journey righteous
274970 i never claimed i was standing for righteousness thats your area of expertise i do what i have to do not because i can but because i need to and thats where we stand as individuals
274971 then let that be the end of it we cannot convince the fallen to uphold our laws
274972 but on the contrary thats not where it will end
274973 i think your starting to understand why im here now but before we start i have a question that i must ask why do you kill for no reason at all i know that you have no allegiance to any man so why randomly
274974 we never kill randomly and the fact you think so perturbs me
274975 if thats how society thinks of our work then there are more fallen ones than i had previously concluded we are gods servants his dark angels that clean his house of the unwanted the rejected and the impure for millenniums sin has existed in every person on this planet and on more than one occasion god has needed to set things right but rather than constantly destroying the world with fire and water he now sends a less destructive yet equally efficient manner to do that very same thing it is a cleansing of the world and we are the chosen ones after all we owe him for sacrificing his own son for us its our turn to repay the debt
274976 well from what it looks like to me is that you both are lunatics who are merely human fantasizing about a higher purpose i may be an atheist but at least i know from reading that book on the best sellers list that god would never order the random deaths of his children his only son died for the privilege of sinning
274977 we never expected one of the fallen to understand his divine purpose sometimes even angels need to get their hands dirty we dont need your so called understanding
274978 if thats how your god is ill take the circles of hell
274979 how the fuck did we not see that coming are we fucking stupid
274980 calm down we did see it coming thats why that suitcase bomb didnt kill us
274981 speaking of which why the hell was he here to kill us who hired him did that bitch of a client betray us
274982 then it must have been elizabeth you know our target
274983 then lets pay that fucking bitch a visit before those damn pigs show up and get in the way
274984 why does your wife insist you accompany me on this hit
274985 well elizabeth would think it rude to speak on her behalf but if you insist i believe its for punishment
274986 all of this this whole terrible ordeal its all my fault
274987 hit this up man it seems like you have a lot of shit on your mind
274988 i may not know what sins youve committed but whatever it was i believe youve paid for it
274989 the fact that your punishing yourself so badly shows that you cant be all that bad
274990 who are we to judge whats right were both murderers
274991 listen mr heart its apparent to me that youve killed well so have i and frankly we both understand that we cant be the judges on who should be killed and when we know that killing is wrong yet we carry on with all the heaviness in our hearts and for what
274992 i suppose i see where your coming from but who are we to side with selfishness and go with our feelings i murdered an innocent man for the love of my wife yet out there in the real world millions of people have their own needs and their own goals what makes ours more important
274993 i continue down this destructive course to keep my family alive i dont choose to do it yes it may sound selfish but in a way we are sacrificing ourselves for the greater good men like the ones ive killed or the man you killed have nothing to fear in death they carried out their lives with innocence and purity yet here we are with all our blackened souls regretting every victim we ever laid our hands on the tragedy is that we arent insane and we arent prideful of our work because if it were like that everything would be a lot more simple the deaths of these people wouldnt weigh so heavy on us we could finally turn away from our sins but we cant and we know what we are doing and were doing it for others this isnt selfishness because were already dead
274994 for a few reasons really one is that if god existed then im burning for eternity and that thought frightens me the other is that if i dont burn then that too frightens me
274995 because if god allows me in heaven then he is one twisted motherfucker
274996 i find it easier to believe in nothing than to believe in anything after all religion was created to allow people afraid of death to sleep at night i say if that helps then by golly believe in whatever the hell you like thats why im an atheist
274997 i know her type shes the kind of woman that will never be satisfied you could give her the whole world and unless its covered in her victims blood shell spit at it this type of thing is viral mr heart it can consume your very being and turn all your values upside down you cant let it turn you into the hero and the villain
274998 i dont think there is a bit of hero inside of me
274999 you dont have to wear a cape or do courageous things to be one a hero can be in your eyes only its present in all of us its that voice that tells us the difference between right and wrong its that sense of morality that keeps murderers like you and me on the line between killer and lunatic
275000 no im a coward i always have been and thats how itll end
275001 after all this is done and all the fighting ends ask yourself this was it all really worth it and if it wasnt then will you continue down that path where you know the end we both know it doesnt end well and at the conclusion of these events did any of it get any better
275002 if these guys are as good as rumored then this is not where or how it ends after all i know where they go to recuperate
275003 what are you doing the highway is a much faster way of reaching mount joy
275004 we need to get our heads straight and psychologically recuperate my friend were letting this fallen creature get the best of us and frankly i feel like god will speak to us here tonight
275005 maybe your right we need to get some fresh air and listen to gods words pull over
275006 there must be a reason why we were taken so off guard tonight
275007 that fucker rigged our car how sloppy are we getting
275008 calm down be thankful that god called us out of that car
275009 it doesnt matter every step we take hade already had planned out
275010 the explosive must have been set to this specific time
275011 yeah like maybe weve been following a pattern too easily recognized perhaps he knew the time it would take for us to leave the club and arrive here
275012 is it really that far of a stretch i mean he figured out who we are what we stand for and even what club we attend
275013 so far every trap he makes sets us up so that if we escape we fall into an even deeper one
275014 i think you were right noah this benjamin hade deserves some credit for creating a plan this elaborate
275015 hey fucker thats what you get for messing with black and woods you really didnt think you would win on our turf did you well now look whos car is all banged up
275016 some shit head ive never seen before in my life
275017 what kind of name is that ive never heard of you
275018 this aint a fucking game so im going to lay out some very real options you can decide on a you tell us who was driving that hummer or b i blow your mother fucking brains out its your choice
275019 yeah thats the same guy that challenged us at the industrial nation now we know for sure that elizabeth hired him to kill us
275020 so are you gonna keep talking tell us where he is
275021 thats not fucking good enough mr heart not fucking good enough
275022 so youre a damn mute now then youre no use to me
275023 wait please dont kill me i i might know where he lives my wife knew and she told me recently please let me live
275024 h he lives at the base of mount joy where this road intersects the main highway i i think its house number 187
275025 excellent now we can pay mr hade a little visit on our way to our target
275026 i continue down this destructive course to keep my family alive
275027 i i dont know he hasnt been home all night please dont hurt us what do you want
275028 we want blood he didnt exactly realize what he was getting himself into when he fucked with us
275029 wait what are you doing these people didnt do anything to you
275030 so lets find him hes obviously not here please dont hurt these people
275031 well from what it looks like to me is that you both are lunatics who are merely human fantasizing about a higher purpose
275032 after all this is done and all the fighting ends ask yourself this was it all really worth it and if it wasnt then will you continue down that path where you know the end we both know it doesnt end well and at the conclusion of these events did any of it get any better
275033 if god existed then im burning for eternity and that thought frightens me
275034 i may be an atheist but at least i know from reading that book on the best sellers list that god would never order the random deaths of his children his only son died for the privilege of sinning
275035 men like the ones ive killed or the man you killed have nothing to fear in death they carried out their lives with innocence and purity yet here we are with all our blackened souls regretting every victim we ever laid our hands on the tragedy is that we arent insane and we arent prideful of our work because if it were like that everything would be a lot more simple the deaths of these people wouldnt weigh so heavy on us we could finally turn away from our sins but we cant and we know what we are doing and were doing it for others this isnt selfishness because were already dead
275036 those assassins they killed mr hades entire family even his kids those bastards even murdered the fucking kids
275037 hes gone i havent seen him since last night but forget about that their on their way here next and we have to leave
275038 you god damned failure youre a mother fucking disgrace i fucking hate you
275039 no you didnt you dont really love me if you did then you wouldve succeeded you fucking bastard
275040 i know her type shes the kind of woman that will never be satisfied you could give her the whole world and unless its covered in her victims blood shell spit at it
275041 what do you want from me i only serve you every waking moment i try to think of some way to make your day become a little brighter my hearts always belonged to you so what the fuck can i do to get it back
275042 its not too late my dear if you want my love then you will go back out there and stop them
275043 this type of thing is viral mr heart it can consume your very being and turn all your values upside down you cant let it turn you into the hero and the villain
275044 i dont think there is a bit of hero inside of me
275045 you dont have to wear a cape or do courageous things to be one
275046 you heard me all my life ive wanted you but now i understand that all you ever wanted was bragging rights against anna well i dont want to have any part in that anymore
275047 dont you bring up her fucking name in this house
275048 youre out of your fucking mind and now i know the difference between you and me i know the difference between right and wrong i have a sense of morality and without it you just fall in the category of lunatic
275049 thats nice but youre the fucking murderer you killed anthony you did not me
275050 i may not know what sins youve committed but whatever it was i believe youve paid for it
275051 the fact that your punishing yourself so badly shows that you cant be all that bad
275052 who are we to judge whats right were both murderers
275053 in a way we are sacrificing ourselves for the greater good men like the ones ive killed or the man you killed have nothing to fear in death they carried out their lives with innocence and purity yet here we are with all our blackened souls regretting every victim we ever laid our hands on the tragedy is that we arent insane and we arent prideful of our work because if it were like that everything would be a lot more simple the deaths of these people wouldnt weigh so heavy on us we could finally turn away from our sins but we cant and we know what we are doing and were doing it for others this isnt selfishness because were already dead
275054 still the troubles still the rain still the turmoil still the pain
275055 after all this is done and all the fighting ends ask yourself this was it all really worth it and if it wasnt then will you continue down that path where you know the end we both know it doesnt end well and at the conclusion of these events did any of it get any better

275062 es realmente sorprendente que el se or alcalde de santa cruz haya firmado un decreto de traspaso de responsabilidades en el que se le pasen las competencias de la concejal esther sarrautte a su compa ero y portavoz jos alberto d az est banez sin tener en cuenta la existencia de otro decreto previo en el que se indica que el concejal est banez estar tambi n ausente esto nos viene a demostrar que el equipo de gobierno municipal est completamente dividido ni tan siquiera se hablan entre ellos no se comunican las ausencias ni las sustituciones unos concejales no saben cuando los otros concejales est n de vacaciones claro que no tendr amos que extra arnos mucho porque en santa cruz s lo tenemos concejales en el grupo de gobierno que est n para figurar
275063 llama la atenci n que se gasten casi 34 millones al a o es una cantidad incre ble el alcalde tiene desde hace a os seis guardaespaldas y el teniente alcalde tiene otros tres resulta parad jico que ninguno de los dos sean capaces de explicarnos el porqu de la necesidad de tener esos guardaespaldas y s tiene que venir a dar las explicaciones el concejal de seguridad hilario rodr guez cuando menos resulta llamativo que ni zerolo ni llanos se atrevan a dar las razones que tienen para tener adjudicados nueve guardaespaldas
275064 en santa cruz toda obra nueva se comienza con un presupuesto que luego se dispara recuerdan el caso garc a cabrera ahora dicen que el parque garc a sanabria precisa de mayor inversi n econ mica un parque que entendemos ni siquiera est debidamente recepcionado por el ayuntamiento hemos visto c mo se pasan unas facturas al cobro con sumas incre bles es como si hubiesen sido engrosadas nosotros nos preguntamos si es que este grupo de gobierno municipal se dedica a sostener y mantener las empresas de sus amigos con dinero p blico
275065 me ha llamado mucho la atenci n lo nerviosa que se puso la concejal maribel o ate cuando tuvo que explicar lo de los 45 millones de pesetas gastados en la fiesta del 25 de julio estuvo muy nerviosa no s porqu pero lo estaba parec a que intentaba justificar lo injustificable el equipo de gobierno de santa cruz cada d a pierde el poco cr dito y el respeto ciudadano que ya le quedaba ni siquiera saben ofrecer un ejemplo p blico m s que pol ticos serios al servicio del ciudadano parecen unos modelos que se dedican a la vida de far ndula hacen cualquier cosa por salir en una foto
275066 el ayuntamiento de santa cruz no tiene control sobre sus cuentas
275067 their professionalism was something i learned from over the past couple years its something a lot of people will have to carry on

275069 their professionalism was something i learned from over the past couple years its something a lot of people will have to carry on
275070 were not going to rush i know now hes very excited his brothers here
275071 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
275072 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
275073 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
275074 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
275075 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
275076 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue
275077 realistically that track did something that weve never seen it do before and thats not take rubber
275078 that is somehow different from what we experienced in 06 and 07
275079 the whole combination of that tire the car of tomorrow on that racetrack caused that right rear tire to wear like we had never seen before the fronts were similar to what we had seen in 06 and 07 the wear improved on the front but the rear never got any better

275084 to be honest i dont think to this day i will ever in my life do an interview with her
275085 it really affected me and solheim wasnt a time to talk about it
275086 dottie was a family member to me and i dont even see her as a friend any more
275087 i think that it was a really low blow and highly disappointing really because i think that as a golfer you appreciate golf and what we are doing out here it really affected us in our hearts sherri and i thought it was ridiculous really
275088 it was more of a heart thing than anything else we had a team that was there to support us and pull us out of it i dont think sherri or i will ever look at dottie the same
275089 the way laura has chosen to handle the situation publicly is really disappointing
275090 i hope her heart will at some point recognize the comment was not personal highly emotional and certainly never meant to be heard over the air i have made myself available to her but she has chosen not to talk scream at me or whatever else she feels she needs to do for her peace of mind
275091 it doesnt look like its going to be a good one but well wait and see but anticipate that hes not going to be playing much football this year
275092 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

275096 it would definitely help my chances at the next level
275097 derrick is in the middle of the pack in punting in this league
275098 hes not a bad punter and hes not one of the elite guys i think he can do better he had an off year he would admit that as well hes had slumps in the past that hes come out of this particular year he didnt really come out of it that generated this competition
275099 its been hard to just kind of relax and let things unfold
275100 i dont feel right now that im hitting the ball as well as i should be but ive had plenty of bad weeks of practice and plenty of good games following it so im not real concerned
275101 i dont think of it as pressure but i think of it as showing them that i definitely have the ability
275102 theyre expecting a lot out of me its a great motivator for me

275302 no le debo nada al partido aprista ni tampoco mi bancada
275303 were going to do everything in our power to get a stanley cup championship
275304 we take this very seriously any interference with the lifeguards and we have taken a very hard approach we could have been a lot harder
275305 business i can understand was interrupted but thats for the safety and welfare of our public and that is what our duty is
275306 it should not have happened it just should not have happened
275307 were very sorry that it happened we apologize for the incident but it is also a sobering reminder that lifeguards are in charge of the beach
275308 slammed into my husband full force had to be going 85 95 mph
275309 the officer who had hit us came up to my car and let me know that he was the one the one who hit us and that he was in the wrong and that he apologizes
275310 with that kind of sound it did not sound like no 35 mph it was a loud loud huge bang
275311 was scanning the intersection as i approached with lights and siren on
275312 there were no sirens and no lights and he was just fireballin up the hill
275313 i heard no sirens before the crash and then all of a sudden we heard the loud crash and the siren right after that i thought that was very odd
275314 i did not see police getting any statements in fact there were a bunch of us neighbors standing around who were kind of like feeling willing to go and say something
275315 just wanted to be sure that james wasnt taking advantage of you
275316 we have this fabulous chesterfield sofa which are labrador thinks is fabulous as well but dogs can be dirty and the owners have a hard time with disciplinary action how do we clean this sofa weve heard steam cleaning will ruin velour velvet upholstery is there something we can do ourselves or is this job for a professional only
275317 we were having some fun we were having some fun with our supporters that we sent it out to and were gonna display a sense of humor in this campaign i noticed a couple of days ago that senator obama challenged me to a duel well light sabers is my weapon of choice
275318 but seriously if we have differences we should have appeared at the urban league convention today
275319 ive asked him time after time to appear with me on the same stage so we can discuss the issues that are important to the american people
275320 this is a very respectful campaign ive repeated my admiration and respect for senator obama that clip is of charlton heston its a movie so i really appreciated the movie and i appreciated charlton hestons magnificent acting skills as i saw it but its a movie
275321 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest im we think its got a lot of humor in it and were having fun and enjoying it and that is what campaigns are going to be like thats what every campaign that i have been involved in i am going to enjoy it and im the underdog and we will continue to fight and scrap all the way till november the fourth
275322 the history of the social security debate has taught that too many specifics especially during a presidential campaign has polarized the debate
275323 sen mccain believes this is so important that we do not politicize this debate during an election season
275324 hysteria around a personality thats attractive but when you look under the hood theres not a whole lot there
275325 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief
275326 you want a different kind of politics youre not going to allow these attacks from john mccain to dominate this campaign
275327 i think john mccain has harmed himself in the last week really eroding any capital he had built up in terms of the kind of politician he is
275328 but hes really helped our campaign because so many of you now have contributed in the last week our field offices across the country had people pouring into them yesterday because while john mccain may want to make this campaign about paris hilton and britney spears you want to make it about our future and the change we all need to make
275329 speaker nancy pelosi d calif and the democrats adjourned the house and turned off the light and killed the microphones but republicans are still on the floor talking gas prices

275331 the history of the social security debate has taught that too many specifics especially during a presidential campaign has polarized the debate

275334 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
275335 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
275336 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway

275341 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
275342 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
275343 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
275344 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
275345 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
275346 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
275347 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
275348 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
275349 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
275350 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

275354 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
275355 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
275356 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
275357 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
275358 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

275364 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
275365 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

275368 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

275465 i wasnt too happy with our presence in the movie
275466 i didnt like the movie either i thought the track itself and how it was utilised worked really well but the other songs on the soundtrack were a bit weird i think it was cameron crowe doing his 10 favourite tracks and putting them into a film
275467 that said it raised our profile in america i dont regret that but there are two sides to the story i wouldnt do it again i dont think wed synchronise music to film but it would have to be a movie i was particularly interested in

275472 i think maybe the postal department is partly to blame that they maybe should have an inspection like restaurants
275473 its very difficult to get them out in short order because we like to send them priority and get them out to our patrons as soon as possible
275474 were going to wait until we get the final say that the post office is closed until we do put up a box
275475 we certainly hope that in the future it will reopen

275482 we were having some fun with our supporters that we sent it out to and were gonna display a sense of humor in this campaign
275483 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest we think its got a lot of humor in it and were having fun and enjoying it
275484 we are seeking animate and energize our voters and send them the message that the size of obamas crowds are nothing to be intimidated by we are very pleased with the way things are going and where we are
275485 there is an important role for humor in all campaigns i think all of us would slit our wrists if it wasnt for that
275486 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile tactics
275487 hes too new and he needs to put some meat on his bones
275488 i like to hear everything the headliners get people out but the other side is coming out and checking out new stuff
275489 the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 1 6 billion dollars
275490 we have a plan which seems to work quite well for us
275491 hopefully were a bit safer in q1 these days but it doesnt take much to get trapped its always a tricky session do you want to stretch your luck and get the best track conditions or go out earlier and avoid the traffic
275492 is that we have the cars setup in final practice and there are a couple of hours off and normally some other cars go out on circuit so the circuit deteriorates quite a lot this is a very dirty circuit especially when the porsches the supercup support racers go out on the circuit because they tend to straightline corners and drag a lot of dirt and dust onto the track
275493 because were struggling to get into q2 we try and do three runs to give ourselves every shot at it
275494 the first run really is just a sighter its often a lot lot quicker in the second run but youve got to balance that against getting a clear run and not getting held up so some cars like to go with five minutes to go the track should have cleaned up by then whereas others go right at the death to get the track the best that it can be but you run the risk of being held up
275495 for as long as ive been in motorsport ive heard drivers say theyve been impeded in qualifying
275496 the trouble is that the track develops all the time it just gets quicker and quicker and quicker and the current generation of cars are so close that if you get anything thats slightly out of kilter with the others youre just not gonna get your rightful position so if you go out early yeah youre not gonna get impeded but youll be on a slippery track and overall that can be worse
275497 the losses for the financial system from people walking away could be of the order of one trillion dollars when the entire capital of the us banking system is only 1 3 trillion
275498 the losses for the financial system from people walking away could be
275499 you could have most of the us banking system wiped out so this is a total disaster

275503 looking ahead liberals are determined to derail potential opposition to their plans to accelerate the deconstruction of america consequently they have targeted talk radio bringing back the fairness doctrine is just one facet of their scheme to eviscerate the only part of the media controlled by conservatives
275504 the left will do anything to gag its opponents from the college campus to the halls of congress think campus speech codes think hate crimes legislation think speech suppression zones surrounding abortion clinics liberals are the chief proponents of censorship in america
275505 they use the guise of not being politically correct to ratchet up their anti gay anti woman and overtly racist language

275525 everyone is sure to be translating this film into contemporary politics
275526 dont you think its interesting that your movie was funded at this point
275527 the implication was that funding came from the u s government
275528 the movies just too darned silly to withstand any ideological theorizing
275529 graphic novel movie about a bunch of guys stomping the snot out of each other
275530 the film 300 is a work of fiction inspired by the frank miller graphic novel and loosely based on a historical event the studio developed this film purely as a fictional work with the sole purpose of entertaining audiences it is not meant to disparage an ethnicity or culture or make any sort of political statement

275538 in an era of escalating gas prices people want more affordable transportation and housing choices the proposed changes to our 1958 parking regulations support this too much parking generates unnecessary traffic congestion affecting city residents and suburban commuters alike we are diverting private and public resources that could be used to improve transit walking and bicycling and offer greater relief to those who need to drive
275539 under the districts current parking regulations new development in our city is forced to mimic suburban places like atlanta tysons corner and rockville pike indeed under the districts current parking regulations construction of some of our citys beloved historic neighborhoods dupont capitol hill georgetown would be illegal people can have the freedom to save money and protect the environment by driving less and opting for climate friendly commutes if we dont require unnecessary parking these new regulations are an important step in the right direction
275540 these zoning reforms are part of the trend that is making d c a great city for bicycling and helping people rely less on driving
275541 the new zoning code would work with rather than against the citys natural advantages compact walkable neighborhoods a street grid that makes bicycling and walking convenient and improving bicycling conditions as we better accommodate bicycling in street designs

275550 the hearing tomorrow is part of a separate process to authorize the gob sales themselves and decide what whitehall can and cant sell
275551 whitehall argues that it has the right to sell consignment merchandise because there is a dispute over whether the goods were provided under arrangements valid under state law
275552 some of the jewelry suppliers counter whitehalls argument and contend no public filings about the consignments were required under state law
275553 the hearing also covers whitehalls motion for final approval of 80 million in financing from lenders for whom bank of america na serves as agent whitehall already has interim authority to borrow 22 million
275554 the chapter 11 petition by chicago based whitehall listed assets of 207 1 million against debt of 185 4 million whitehalls stores in 39 states include 78 purchased in april in the chapter 11 liquidation of friedmans inc
275555 the case is whitehall jewelers holdings inc 08 11261 u s bankruptcy court district of delaware wilmington
275556 a delaware judge has approved the bidding procedures for bankrupt jewelry retailer whitehall jewelers holdings inc
275557 if the company gitanjali was able to acquire whitehall jewelers 375 stores it would likely be the principal diamond supplier to about 518 mall based jewelry stores with a annual turnover of about 475 million
275558 however it remains to be seen whether the company can strike a deal with the creditors to buy whitehall
275559 according to court papers the company had 207 million in assets and about 185 4 million in debt the gitanjali deal would probably mean unsecured creditors would get pennies on the dollar while secured creditors recouped most of their investment with gitanjali the likely beneficiary of whitehalls future purchases trade creditors have little incentive to agree to the deal and would get more if the company was simply liquidated another possibility would be to liquidate the existing inventory and sell the whitehall name and fixed assets to gitanjali how much irreparable damage a 90 to 120 day up to 70 off liquidation sale would do the whitehall and lundstrom trade names is an open question
275560 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis unfortunately the proposal would eliminate floridas 2006 gulf protections and give floridians absolutely no voice in determining where exploration could occur
275561 our current crisis is a supply and demand problem and we need a comprehensive plan to address our energy needs and that includes substantially increasing domestic production as well as conservation and renewable fuel technology
275562 a comprehensive solution includes oil shale production exploring the arctic national wildlife refuge and allowing states to decide where to develop offshore resources this proposal falls short of meeting those goals
275563 want us to do something about the high price of a gallon of gas they want offshore drilling and they want to drill now
275564 the only thing ive heard him say is we should inflate our tires he has no plan for addressing the energy challenges that we face we need drilling everywhere that the states and the governors such as in the state of florida approve of
275565 i didnt bring up the issue sen obama did three times in one day he brought up the issue of race i responded
275566 i think that the governor has earned a place in the republican party not just in the state of florida but nationally
275567 hes a great leader and i think that obviously he has a major role to play in the republican party in this nation in the future we arent talking about the vp vetting process
275568 id be willing to make you a bet if you added up all of the people who have attended every political event john mccain has held since the campaign started the number would not get to 200 000 which is the number of people that watched barack obama speak in berlin
275569 that ad that he put out is nothing more than the same jealousy he displayed last week when obama was on this tour

275579 meanwhile the head of the radio department had brought his son in to see u2 and walked into the studio to be confronted with five guys sitting there stripped down to their boxers drinking beer chatting away as if it was the most normal thing in the world

275655 there is in fact no worldview more reprehensible in its arrogance than that of a religious believer the creator of the universe takes an interest in me approves of me loves me and will reward me after death my current beliefs drawn from scripture will remain the best statement of the truth until the end of the world everyone who disagrees with me will spend an eternity in hell an average christian in an average church listening to an average sunday sermon has achieved a level of arrogance simply unimaginable in scientific discourse and there have been some extraordinarily arrogant scientists
275656 in the beginning the church was a fellowship of men and women centering on the living christ then the church moved to greece where it became a philosophy then it moved to rome where it became an institution next it moved to europe where it became a culture and finally it moved to america where it became an enterprise

275714 excuse me but do you know where the wine buyer could be found
275715 im sorry all our senior staff is away at an event including the wine buyer may i help you with something
275716 well whats up with this crazy deal on the pepper tree chard five for 18 99 is rather curious dont you think i wonder why he needs to move it so quick
275717 woah i need to take some of this home too
275718 wed have to drink it now before it goes bad like this season
275719 nah just because its a 2004 doesnt mean its past thats a bit of a misconception ive had loads of great chardonnay that were aged talbot winery in the santa lucia highlands they prefer you to let their chards age before you drink them but you have a point talbot is excellent quality to begin with we cant speak for the quality of these grapes hey you dont even drink white wine how come you wanted to go so badly
275720 my best guess is that the wine buyer s worried that this wont sell because people will think its to old and hes pushing it like mad to drink now sounds fine to me that is our intention anyway

275730 other than it being just a smidge pretentious i like the way it looks
275731 the navigators basic shape is clean if slightly bland the profile is tidy for such a big vehicle almost lean
275732 might as well be called the blingmobile thanks to its giant diamond cut chrome grille
275733 most amount of chrome available on the nose of any current production vehicle
275734 is very expensive these days and is rarely used on new cars and lincoln navigator 2008
275735 it sure looks real from far away though and will look that way to the people and drivers you pass on the street
275736 2008 lincoln navigator is about as big bold and flashy as they come
275737 other than it being just a smidge pretentious i like the way it looks it is distinctive stylish and decidedly lincoln discreet however it is not
275738 if you like the retro design you wont be disappointed with the finish particularly with the lighter anigre wood trim the square ish shapes and flat switch clusters inside the navigator generate a kind of post modern scandinavian feel
275739 easy to read and extremely distinctive the gauges make an elegant statement
275740 the instrument bezels inspired by popular rectangular fashion eyewear have a 50s retro look
275741 still lacks the standout performance expected of todays luxury suvs
275742 single overhead cam triton v8 still generates a maximum 300 horsepower and virtually every other big suv has passed it by
275743 has the looks part down the 300 horsepower v 8 engine seems woefully lacking in the power department especially at takeoff
275744 still lacks the standout performance expected of todays luxury suvs as its 5 4 liter v8 feels a bit breathless next to the v8s in the escalade mercedes benz gl450
275745 is not as muscular as rival lincoln navigator 2008 compensates in part for its relatively gutless engine with an excellent transmission
275746 six speed automatic is the sole transmission and the navigator can tow up to 8 950 pounds when properly equipped
275747 the automatic transmission might be the best its both smooth and responsive and performs almost exactly as we like shifting up or down when we would if we were doing it with a gear change and clutch and almost never shifting inappropriately
275748 returned just 12 5 mpg low even for this class
275749 4wd models are too heavy to be rated in the epa fuel economy program
275750 steering response and overall body control make the big ute a surprisingly agile handler
275751 the ride was pleasant on most surfaces but nothing spectacular
275752 initially the brake pedal feels a little soft but its very progressive in application and easy to master for smooth even stops despite a curb weight exceeding 6 000 pounds for all wheel drive models
275753 any version of this full size sport utility vehicle can seat either seven or eight
275754 inside the cabin big plush seats welcome the driver and passengers
275755 third row was about as cramped as any third row in a large suv these days but the power fold option was nifty to watch
275756 no shortage of room in any direction the seats are generously sized and very supportive
275757 center console sports four cupholders for the incredibly thirsty traveler
275758 it didnt fit much other stuff there were no smaller cubbies for things like breath mints change a cell phone etc
275759 the second and third row seats the navigator l opens a whopping 129 cubic feet of cargo space
275760 luxuriously soft leather upholstery and real wood interior trim are standard
275761 premium ambiance is let down by low budget switchgear feel painted plastic panels and a few too many unpadded surfaces
275762 something odd in the texture of 2008 lincoln navigators new interior plastic it doesnt seem nice enough to be in a pseudo luxury vehicle
275763 uncannily quiet inside due to a new acoustic windshield thicker side glass and increased insulation throughout
275764 has not been crash tested by the insurance institute for highway safety which has a more stringent testing process than nhtsa
275765 dual stage front airbags front occupant side impact airbags and curtain style head protection airbags for all outboard seats
275766 four channel antilock brakes abs rear obstacle detection and a tire pressure monitor
275767 tire pressure is always important to keep an eye on and even more so with lincoln for making a rearview camera available but its unfortunately part of a pricey option package
275768 once the driver gets comfortable however its hard to beat the commanding view ahead a greyhound bus or tractor trailer rig are about the only vehicles on the road that can obstruct the drivers forward vision in a 2008 lincoln navigator
275769 comfort and convenience features that were extras are now standard
275770 comfort and convenience features that were extras are now standard

275776 172 horsepower engine works well in the compass platform and returns above average gas mileage
275777 plenty of on board storage spots are available to stow water bottles cds and what have you
275778 visibility to front corners and over the shoulder is impeded by thick roof pillars and to the rear by tall headrests

275789 how do you diagnose a case of autism good question i and most teachers have no idea
275790 russos implication is clear is there really such a thing as autism thats not the point of the slate article by the way it points out that diagnosing autism is most often done by using a check list of symptoms it describes it as a spectrum disorder in that is has a range of symptoms and degrees of severity that fact that russo has no idea how to diagnose the disorder is hardly evidence of anything other than his own ignorance that most teachers dont know how to diagnose autism is not supported by facts nor is it hardly relevant since regular classroom teachers are not asked to diagnose anything let alone autism teachers are asked to report behaviors doctors diagnose but russo appears to line up with the crazy savage in this nasty little couple of sentences shameful

275854 by passing and enacting the great lakes compact and keeping control of the lakes in the hands of the states that surround them and value them the most
275855 will protect the health of these precious bodies of freshwater preventing unnecessary and dangerous diversions of great lakes waters i know the people of wisconsin feel strongly about the importance of preserving the lakes for future generations
275856 would preserve and protect one of our national treasures for us and future generations

275858 after forty years of intensive research on school learning in the united states as well as abroad my major conclusion is what any person in the world can learn almost all persons can learn if provided with appropriate prior and current conditions of learning
275859 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
275860 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
275861 office of general counsel has advised that we do not do testing which would imply femas ownership of this issue
275862 do not initiate any testing until we give the ok while i agree that we should conduct testing we should not do so until we are fully prepared to respond to the results once you get results and should they indicate some problem the clock is running on our duty to respond to them
275863 these lawyers should be disbarred for incompetence they should also be held liable civilly for complicity in whatever harm was suffered by the residents of the trailers after their knowledge of the severe health risks
275864 if testing at an earlier stage would have been the prudent and reasonable thing to do
275865 just as people owe one another the duty of reasonable care to prevent harm from happening in first place
275866 we also owe one another the duty to mitigate that harm as best within our power i have a duty not to hit you with my car but if i do i have a further duty to help you get to the hospital or get medical care
275867 while we dont know when and where disasters will hit we do know that disasters hit government agencies including fema are expected to plan for those disasters
275868 fema was certainly capable of issuing specifications for safe trailers which if the reports are true they did not
275869 is only liable in such situations if it supervised and directed day to day activities of its contractors which did not occur in this case
275870 fema was acting pursuant to a mandate and that mandate required it to provide long term and temporary housing that was safe and sufficient for residential use
275871 there was no discretion involved they were required to provide safe housing
275872 no government agency has discretion in whether to provide something dangerous to the public or not
275873 agency discretion does not allow it to put the public in harms way
275874 housing is a fundamental human right and disaster housing was and continues to be a mandate of the federal government
275875 what we know is that those who were most vulnerable were placed in the greatest harm
275876 its the manufacturers who are primarily responsible however femas response in the way it handled this situation was a true debacle

276037 obama thinks that he can convince terrorists to behave the average israeli knows that is impossible
276038 the american election is followed very closely here as it is intimately tied to a possible timetable for an iran strike should that be necessary and possible
276039 so as an israeli i would not vote for obama he is just too much of a wildcard however as an american i would for obama i would vote for him because a vote for him holds a kind of magic it makes you believe that maybe the american dream is still true that a bright hard working politically savvy outsider can rise to be a presidential candidate it also makes you hope that perhaps america is a bit more race blind than we suspected and that is something to be deeply proud of as an american i believe a vote for obama really is playing a tiny role in history
276040 at this point in our history one candidate is no different than the other
276041 what right does barak obama or any u s delegate have to tell israel that it cant build communities
276042 a u s presidents first action towards israel should be inaction israel has a thriving economy a powerful military and i think that a wise president would look to israel as a place to learn and not to dictate terms
276043 he seems to really flipflop his opinions on certain things depending on who his audience is he could turn out to be a good president or a horrible one i just dont know what his stance is
276044 no creo que sea por eso a uno le gusta un lugar que tiene un buen equipo y una buena afici n que se merece un estadio mejor que el que tiene e incluso es antireglamentario y espero que lo terminen pronto
276045 todo eso no me asusta pero eso s respetamos mucho al rival yo respeto mucho a daniel guzm n a su equipo y a su afici n y creo que la situaci n es rec proca creo que a ellos tampoco les afecta que vaya pumas pero nos van a respetar
276046 lo que pas en el juego contra el am rica no creo que haya sido producto del poco tiempo que le qued en relaci n a los dem s pues hicieron un buen partido
276047 se ver un buen espect culo un partido con mucha intensidad y los dos equipos se brindar n
276048 pero yo ya quisiera contar con l porque est en el grupo de los 18 jugadores pero no vamos a caer en la desesperaci n pues no viene a ganar ni a perder solo sino a participar con sus dem s compa eros
276049 es de los pocos temas hoy en d a que no me interesan pues esa persona eriksson hizo su lista como yo hago la m a y no me cuestionan que por qu no convoqu a tal o cual jugador pero no hablo de ese tema y no es que no vaya a apoyar al equipo pero es de m s inter s que tengo que pensar en pumas
276050 no me interesa mucho el tema la selecci n es una cosa que dejo a un lado le brindo mi apoyo pero no me interesa mucho me interesa m s este torneo el grupo en el que estamos y que el equipo vaya adelante y saque resultados
276051 no quiero distraerme ni perder mi tiempo en problemas que no valen la pena si llamaron a tal o cual jugador la verdad no vale la pena perder mi tiempo
276052 cuando vaya all va a trabajar y no hay problema lo mismo har cuando regrese y va a mejorar con un t cnico como eriksson y estando en la selecci n

276137 in questa circostanza la tutela della donna ha avuto la priorit su una legge che non tiene conto delle caratteristiche delle persone e toglie al medico la possibilit di decidere lalternativa migliore per il paziente
276138 for them subjects like the nuclear issue are pretexts the key reason for the hostility of the enemies in the past 30 years against iran is that they want us to pull back so that they can say we have given in

276172 these items may seem trivial to many however as a taxpayer you may be shocked to know the costs of repairing these items
276173 comcasts interference is far more invasive and widespread than the company first conceded
276174 comcast has an anti competitive motive to interfere with customers use of peer to peer applications
276175 monitoring customers connections using deep packet inspection and then determines how it will route some connections based not on their destinations but on their contents in essence comcast opens its customers mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein
276176 interfered with up to three quarters of all peer to peer connections in certain communities
276177 blocking of internet traffic which had the effect of substantially impeding consumers ability to access the content and to use the applications of their choice

276184 while adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media are rare they are encountered regularly by all physicians who administer contrast material to patients and some of these reactions will require treatment
276185 we reviewed our experience to determine how often we encountered these reactions in our practice and how often the reactions required treatment we also wanted to know what happened to those patients who required treatment particularly when they had reactions that were moderate or severe
276186 commonly used medications can be administered safely however treatment errors are not uncommon and in a few instances can lead to patient morbidity
276187 in our study we found a number of instances in which non recommended treatment was provided these cases included the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula rather than mask and at lower than recommended doses over utilization of diphenhydramine including to a few patients who were hypotensive and the administration of higher than recommended doses of epinephrine as well as occasional confusion about which concentrations of epinephrine should be injected in which manner subcutaneously or intravenously in our study the most striking example of patient morbidity from non recommended treatment occurred in the two patients who received doses of 1 mg of epinephrine in the absence of cardiopulmonary arrest who both had cardiac complications fortunately these complications were mild and transient and caused no serious morbidity
276188 we hope that after reading our study radiologists nurses and technologists will agree that they must review the algorithms for treating contrast reactions on a regular basis particularly issues related to diphenhydramine oxygen and epinephrine administration
276189 in fact we would suggest that such a review should probably occur at least twice a year however it is also consoling to know that even when patients have moderate or severe contrast reactions the vast majority recover promptly and without any long term complications

276251 to the christian church in the most catholic sense of the word supernatural religion has always stood for something far more than a system of spiritual instruction or an instrument of moral suasion the deep sense of sin which is central to her faith demands such a divine interposition in the course of natural development as shall work actual changes from guilt to righteousness from sin to holiness from life to death in the sphere not merely of consciousness but of being
276252 here revelation the word enscripturated crb is on principle inseparable from a background of historic facts with which to bring mans life into vital contact is indeed the main reason for its existence to him the facts are become the very bread of life though you tell him a thousand times that the value of the biblical narratives for moral and religious instruction remains precisely the same whether the facts occurred or not it will not satisfy him because he knows full well that all moral instruction and religious impressions combined cannot save his soul in his thirst for redemption from sin he will not rest in anything short of an authentic record of how god wrought wonders in history for the salvation of his people
276253 history we need and that not only in the form of the tale of a certain perfect ethical and religious experience which has somewhere come to the surface on the endless stream of phenomena but such a history as shall involve the opening of the heavens the coming down of god the introduction of miraculous regenerative forces into humanity the enactment of a veritable drama of redemption between the supernatural and the natural world whether we like it or not criticism can touch the essence of our religion because religion has become incarnate and for our sakes had to become incarnate and make itself vulnerable in historic form as the son of god while on earth had to expose himself to the unbelief and scorn of men so the word of the gospel could not be what it is for us unless it were subject to the same humiliation

276261 no tenemos ninguna confirmaci n oficial sobre la llegada de alg n ministro o si nos van a llamar para entrevistarnos con el gobernador en la capital de la provincia por lo que nosotros nos mantenemos firmes en esa ocupaci n pac fica que es una reivindicaci n territorial
276262 venimos a reivindicar nuestro derecho territorial con un acto de ocupaci n pac fica pero las medidas de acci n directa se ir n incrementando si la provincia no acusa recibo
276263 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
276264 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n
276265 las provincias son libres para crear las instancias judiciales que estimen apropiadas pero no pueden vedar a ninguna de ellas y menos a las m s altas la aplicaci n preferente de la constituci n nacional

276268 el mocase nace de ra ces cristianas anarquistas ind genas y criollas recoge sentimientos la historia y memoria que queda latente en el coraz n de los campesinos la dignidad sentimiento de libertad de la necesidad de vincularse con otros y de no permitir que unos dominen a otros tambi n estuvieron presentes rastros guardados en viejos y viejas del monte el mestizaje pueblos de mucha lucha y resistencia
276269 las familias de campo sufren cada d a m s intentos de desalojos detenciones y criminalizaci n con o sin retenciones la represi n seguir las fumigaciones que nos envenenan estar n a la orden del d a y seguiremos en la lucha porque no hay ninguna intenci n de desarmar el modelo de agronegocios ni distribuci n de tierras ni cuestionamientos al actual uso de la tierra la discusi n es entre empresarios del campo y politiqueros de doble discurso
276270 se trata de un conflicto por dinero y poder ni siquiera hay una discusi n ideol gica todos ellos entienden la tierra como una mercanc a y pelean por ver qui n se queda con la mayor parte las cuatro entidades son totalmente opuestas a nuestra ideolog a con un trasfondo hist rico que a n no est saldado donde hubo usurpaci n y desaparici n de una gran parte de nuestro pueblo no nos olvidamos de ese crimen
276271 el gobierno no tiene una pol tica real para cambiar la realidad de los m s necesitados y mucho menos para los pueblos ind genas
276272 fueron masacradas en las mismas tierras que hoy son utilizadas para el monocultivo de soja
276273 el actual tipo de cambio el boom de la soja y las forestales desplazaron a la ganader a desde el litoral y la pampa hacia esta provincia las empresas donde tambi n est n las mineras intentan por todos los medios apropiarse de tierras y agua comprando fraguando t tulos usurpando y prometiendo un progreso que son mentiras
276274 reforma agraria integral y soberan a alimentaria que es la posibilidad de que el pa s tenga su propio proyecto alimentario y no que las multinacionales impongan qu se debe producir
276275 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales
276276 el gobierno provincial alienta cuatro polos productivos la industria del az car y el tabaco el turismo y la miner a todas ellas atentan contra nuestros territorios y nuestra forma de vida
276277 repudiamos las pol ticas de exclusi n y saqueo de los territorios en que vivimos pol ticas promovidas por los grupos econ micos que tienen como c mplices a los gobiernos de turno
276278 el campo profundo reclama tierra que no se destruya m s el medio ambiente agua y reclama pol ticas para frenar el xodo hacia las ciudades y todo esto no depende de las retenciones depende de pol ticas reales que ning n gobierno impulsa
276279 la faa no dice que sus afiliados con la complicidad del sistema pol tico y jur dico desalojan campesinos y sinceremos que esos productores no cosechan alimentos en beneficio del pueblo producen forrajes para la especulaci n en el mercado externo
276280 esas cuatro patronales no nos representan pero tampoco el gobierno que nos ha fallado nos abandon
276281 tengo la sensaci n de haber hecho todo lo posible y haberlo hecho bien en el fallo el tribunal le dio validez a la presunci n de inocencia que en los casos mapuches ha sido muy pocas veces respetada y ahora espero que ese fallo sea respetado

276413 we are concerned that user generated video content on sites such as youtube does not carry any age classification nor is there a watershed before which it cannot be shown
276414 we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users
276415 given the volume of content uploaded on our site we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly

276422 will people think of this as negative advertising look its the most entertaining thing ive seen on tv in a while i wouldnt anticipate anything about this being negative
276423 i dont poll paris hilton and britney spears but i know theyre international celebrities so apples to apples
276424 it has not gone unnoticed by this campaign that obama makes outrageous narcissistic statements suggesting that his candidacy is what the world has been waiting for excuse me

276440 has obvious weaknesses and limitations however it offers opportunities for engagement which are not present elsewhere particularly for those who are concerned with governance democracy and transparency with how the different parts of the system work either for or against development it can also be a forum in which new proposals are put forward and support built
276441 obama has been addressing the environment and energy issues with a focus on global warming and the rising cost of fuel in many of his ads this summer
276442 his commitment to healthcare is visible in many of obamas recent ads ending the iraq war and investing that money here at home is also very important to obama and was mentioned in his ads this summer
276443 in mccains ads he addresses cutting government spending improving national security making healthcare affordable and accessible for all americans and the need to combat climate change and lower gas prices

276451 the great thing about flavored olive oil is that it is so versatile although i used it as a salad dressing out of convenience the oils could easily be paired with a mild fish or even chicken what i really enjoyed about the blood orange olive oil was the subtle flavor and smooth texture that it added to my crunch salad without being overbearing the o olive oil turned a regular salad into something special i will use this again and again
276452 i thank you for the opportunity i was given to use the o olive oil i will be using it very often making the same salad and trying the other recipes included thank you so much
276453 as soon as i opened the bottle i was greeted with one of the freshest scents i have ever smelled the combination of olive oil and meyer lemons creates such a fantastic aroma that i was sold on this product before tasting it it really smells that fresh i wanted to use it in every part of my meal but settled on a makeshift garlic crostini an appetizer well complemented by this wonderful olive oil for the garlic crostini we spread the olive oil over 1 4 inch thick slices of french baguette we then crushed tomatoes and mixed it with minced garlic salt and pepper we topped each piece of the crostini with the mixture and baked for 10 minutes in a 350 degree oven the hint of lemon really added to the flavor to make a great appetizer overall i really enjoyed the quality of this olive oil not only was the meyer lemon flavor fantastic it felt like the kind of olive oil id find in a high class italian restaurant its the type of olive oil i want to mix with parmesan cheese and smother all over everything great product i highly recommend it
276454 let me begin by telling you that the recipe i used was
276455 thick 1 lb fresh brussels sprouts trimmed and cut in halves 1 large onion sliced 1 4
276456 this is a family favorite recipe that i make frequently with plain olive oil using the o olive oil with the lemon flavor was such a refreshing addition it managed to bring out the delicate flavors of the root vegetables as well as a new twist on the red bell peppers and the brussels sprouts this recipe makes a large amount so is excellent for large family meals i was very favorably impressed with the product and look forward to using it in other dishes

276458 e3 this year in my opinion it was pretty much disappointing to everybody
276459 the press were disappointed the people i talked to in the industry are disappointed almost everyone agree that that was the wrong way to do it
276460 i think we struck a balance of being vendor supported and still being in touch with the gamers
276461 we had over 6 000 hours of volunteer time thats like the polar opposite of e3 which is all about business

276472 as que al menos estoy contento de estar en renault recibiendo el m ximo apoyo del equipo y sabiendo que todos trabaja d a y noche para darme el mejor coche posible
276473 no fue una buena jornada pero no lo hicimos del todo mal
276474 las fallas hidr ulicas se presentaron durante todo el d a
276475 venimos aqu despu s de dos carreras dif ciles y nuestro objetivo tiene que ser extraer el m ximo potencial del coche y as asegurar el mejor resultado posible
276476 los resultados del viernes no suelen ser definitivos para saber qui n est por delante especialmente en una pista como hungaroring que siempre est sucia el primer d a
276477 es dif cil decir d nde estamos exactamente comparados con los rivales pero est claro que son muy r pidos
276478 los resultados del viernes son siempre dif ciles de evaluar ya que uno no sabe qu cargas de carburante llevan el resto de los equipos y m s aqu en budapest donde los neum ticos sufren mucho graining el primer d a
276479 un d a normal de entrenamiento en el que hemos dado muchas vueltas y recogido una gran cantidad de informaci n para analizar esta noche
276480 nuestro programa del viernes ha ido bien y hemos hecho progresos
276481 hoy tuvimos dos sesiones sin casi problemas salvo por las dificultades con el tr fico aunque eso siempre ocurre en este circuito
276482 un comienzo del d a constructivo simulamos situaciones de carrera y tanto lewis como heikki obtuvieron buenos tiempos por vuelta con m s goma en la pista las condiciones cambiar n ma ana as que todav a es muy pronto para juzgar d nde estamos comparados con nuestros rivales
276483 no empezamos el d a como quer amos hicimos bastantes cambios a lo largo de la sesi n para encontrar la mejor direcci n para nosotros definitivamente encontramos el camino con los cambios e hicimos algunos buenos progresos con el coche sobre los neum ticos todav a no hemos tomado una decisi n no est perfectamente claro qu opci n es la correcta pero lo analizaremos esta noche una vez m s la competencia parece muy fuerte especialmente los renault
276484 nuestro ritmo no ha sido el que quer amos por la ma ana as que hicimos algunos peque os cambios en el descanso entre sesiones los cambios funcionaron mejor para nosotros pues ten amos mejor ritmo por la tarde todav a tenemos algo de trabajo que hacer esta tarde para estar seguros de tener lo mejor del coche para ma ana tambi n s que tenemos que trabajar para mejor mi ritmo la verdad
276485 un d a ajetreado para el equipo durante el que hemos trabajado en varios cambios de reglajes en ambos coches a lo largo de las sesiones
276486 en general hemos tenido un buen d a que nos ha permitido conocer mejor la nueva suspensi n trasera con la que competimos por primera vez este fin de semana
276487 ha sido un d a complicado algo previsto ya que continu bamos el trabajo de reglaje con la suspensi n trasera y las piezas aerodin micas nuevas
276488 hemos dado un paso hacia delante con la nueva caja de cambios desafortunadamente no la podremos utilizar ni ma ana ni el domingo
276489 tenemos mucho trabajo por realizar durante la noche para poder darle a nuestro monoplaza un buen ritmo cuando hicimos vueltas completas logramos un buen ritmo pero siempre hay que ir a m s ma ana tenemos que seguir haciendo un buen trabajo
276490 tambi n hay una nueva generaci n excelente de pilotos de red bull y toro rosso est del lado de la nueva generaci n lo ideal ser a tener un piloto joven al lado de uno experimentado adem s tenemos que ver c mo se desarrolla bourdais en la segunda mitad de la temporada

276493 como es normal aqu en hungr a ha sido un viernes dif cil debido a la suciedad del circuito fue dif cil sacar conclusiones claras porque hab a un desgaste de los neum ticos que ha afectado al rendimiento del coche y al equilibrio general por lo tanto nos concentramos en encontrar qu tipo de comportamiento podemos esperar de los neum ticos espero que podamos tener otro fin de semana bueno porque me gusta la pista el coche ha sido competitivo recientemente y esperamos lograr m s puntos
276494 la ma ana fue bien para m en una pista sucia y no tuvimos problemas con el coche en la segunda sesi n la pista cambi hab a un poco m s de adherencia y el coche comenz a ser un poco m s dif cil de pilotar pero en general no ha sido un mal d a el de hoy esperamos que podamos continuar a esta velocidad si podemos clasificarnos bien y tenemos el ritmo de carrera de hockenheim podremos terminar en los puntos tras mi accidente en la ltima carrera estoy completamente recuperado entren en jerez la pasada semana sin problemas super un reconocimiento m dico ayer y me sent bien conduciendo el coche hoy
276495 la sesi n de hoy ha sido muy sencilla y pudimos salir airosos de una gran cantidad de trabajo en la aerodin mica y los reglajes

276506 but then i had one of my commanders sit me down and say brian you can use this platform to highlight the work of your fellow soldiers and you can use it to get the word out about mixed martial arts id never really looked at it that way before and it made perfect sense
276507 we have a war going on and lots of great young men and women fighting for us
276508 whether or not you disagree with the war and thats your right as an american i will always take the opportunity to highlight the great work and sacrifice of those serving overseas

276521 i think the average person has access to a very large audience potential that they wouldnt get over broadcast tv airwaves
276522 anyone can post content and potentially reach an audience of a few million its a way to bring attention to your cause
276523 when we created youtube we wanted to create a place where people can connect with others through online video
276524 its inspiring to see that its now being used for such important causes making the most of our community and a truly global reach it offers
276525 the biggest hurdle there ultimately is just because you post something doesnt mean people will care it ultimately relies on the community itself to help virally distribute and draw attention to any specific video
276526 their professionalism was something i learned from over the past couple years its something a lot of people will have to carry on

276552 the fact that there are internal changes does not change the fact that a threat exists
276553 it doesnt change the interests of israel that we are obligated to represent

276572 in return the united states of america would fulfil their commitments
276573 in june of 1996 i went to belgrade and negotiated an agreement with milosevic and two of karadzics henchmen that he would quit as president of the serb portion of bosnia and as head of his political party immediately and disappear from public life
276574 he reluctantly signed that agreement without ever coming to the negotiations but then in order to protect himself he put out this false story
276575 from the first days of this administration been very consistent in urging the serbian government to turn over karadzic as well as others that are wanted to the international criminal tribunal in the hague
276576 people listened intently to what was said one man who served as a serbian soldier was in tears and said the process should be scrapped they revere him as a leader of bosnian serbs and as a protector
276577 the beginning of the trial shows he is trying to spin his responsibility about what happened in the war
276578 i would like to see justice i am very glad to see karadzic in the dock i think he will have a fair trial i dont feel any sympathy about karadzic hopefully it wont last as long as the milosevic trial
276579 this is the day everyone connected with the international tribunal has been waiting for
276580 it is the day many victims of the crimes in the former yugoslavia have been waiting for
276581 the prosecutors are very eager to try and avoid that sort of disruption quite what they intend to do we dont know but they say they have learnt a lot from the case of milosevic
276582 of course it will take some months before the prosecution and defence will be ready to start it will be a complex trial but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient

276597 as a direct and proximate result of the university of central floridas negligence ereck plancher collapsed and died
276598 the plancher family has been frustrated by the fact that they have not been able to get an accurate account of what happened during the conditioning drills on march 18 they feel very strongly that they do not want any other families to go through what they are going through
276599 the health of our student athletes is our top priority and we provide superb medical care at ucf

276607 you can take something from 2 89 a pound to 2 99 a pound the consumer doesnt even really notice
276608 a lot of these people just feel very strongly about supporting their local businesses and local economy

276614 omg i cannot believe how much big law and i have in common we went to dinner at taurus where midtown meets buckhead and big firm paid for an amazing meal complete with tuna tartar filet mignon and squash souffl to die for and what great taste in wine there is just something very sexy about a law firm with good taste in wine we talked for hours about the opportunities for our budding relationship ahhh
276615 man summer associate is so refreshing she is so excited about the simplest luxuries and eager to spend long hours with me she is sooo impressed by my office space sophisticated practice areas and international clients she wants me
276616 cog is so lucky to be with me i am so much more sophisticated than she will ever be and there are a million other cogs out there dying to be with me and i am famous people know me who is she she better step it up if she wants to continue to hang with me and my peeps
276617 after two years in a committed relationship with big firm i just feel like he doesnt listen to me anymore he is all about his needs but he never asks me what i want anymore its just become so routine bill bill bill no more fine dining no paul simon concerts no flowers would he even care if i just left what happened i miss the good old days
276618 i dont even love him anymore but at least i know his flaws i am too old to get back out there i am comfortable with him he is stable and provides a good life for me ill just have to show him i am worth the commitment i will bill more hours
276619 in a state of tranquil enjoyment and content free from pain and trouble at ease
276620 in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
276621 call me na ve but if these investors take an ownership stake by buying merrill shares why do they get compensated if the price falls
276622 i thought providing equity capital to banks meant i shared in their upside and downside can i have the same please
276623 a vote of confidence for the management team and the underlying strengths of merrill lynchs franchise
276624 if you got the opportunity to buy something at a whopping discount of 22 cents on the buck would you jump at it or would you demand that the seller provide the financing
276625 that depends if you thought that what you were buying was a true rock bottom steal at 22 cents or if the 22 cents despite its rock bottom appearance had room to roam lower
276626 the announcement reminds us that the market clearing prices of many illiquid abs products are probably lower than where they are marked on bank books
276627 the danger is that these financial institutions are forced to sell at fire sale prices in order to preserve capital the news doesnt give us any confidence that this risk will subside anytime soon
276628 i am as poor as a church mouse because i repeatedly demonstrate my faith in the financial system by buying bank stocks when i think they are too low and quickly get shown they were in fact overvalued
276629 but the astronomical tables which i was compelled to use were not such as i could have wished them to be
276630 one mile and twenty eight poles from the south bank of the tennessee river
276631 one of the silliest questions i get asked is whether we should relieve our water problems through conservation or by increasing capacity by accessing the tennessee river
276632 certainly the legislature has authorized the governor to look at
276633 thats one thing jud turner is looking at we want to know the merits of the legal action
276634 people had paid south carolina taxes on those islands and deeds existed
276635 nobody had lived on the islands but they had been cultivated by people from south carolina the court concluded that was enough
276636 tennessee is going to say that theyve governed this territory for 200 years
276637 people there pay taxes to tennessee tennessee provides police support those are important factors
276638 expressly provid ed that georgias western border would reach and cross the tennessee river at nickajack
276639 tennessee subsequently claimed this faulty survey line to be the border but georgia has never officially accepted it and instead has repeatedly tried to get tennessee to correct the mistake
276640 even if the border were moved i think there will be tremendous legal obstacles to getting the water down to atlanta from tennessee
276641 lets do the things we can do that will have an immediate impact now and at a reasonable cost rather than spend money on tremendously expensive and long term litigation
276642 because transfers result in less water in the river system all transfers reduce hydropower generation because less water is run through the hydroturbines
276643 tva has considered charging for transfers and reserves the right to do so

276661 debido a que parece que el senador barack obama ha decidido ofrecer el puesto a la vicepresidencia a otra persona creemos que continuar pidi ndole que escoja a hillary no es saludable para las esperanzas del partido de ganar las elecciones de noviembre

276663 podemos deducir que clinton no est en la lista corta

276697 vmware esxi delivers dramatically quicker and easier installation of virtual appliances this enables our customers to deploy altor s virtual network analysis and security solutions even faster giving them instant visibility into their virtual network activity said amir ben efraim chief executive officer of altor networks with vmware esxi accelerating the pace of virtual appliance deployments in the datacenter the demand for virtual network firewalls also accelerates we are excited to be a vmware partner and support vmware esxi across our products simplifying the delivery and deployment of catbird s v agent virtual appliance via the open virtualization format ovf and vmware esxi is a terrific component of our goal of ensuring catbird customers have instant easy to use protection and compliance for their virtual environments

276703 im just too old hat for it in fact the other two i didnt even know who they were i knew who paris hilton was but then there were other two young girls
276704 say whatever you want about bill clinton but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president
276705 she has counseled her 1 886 delegates to vote for obama
276706 in touch with many delegates around the country and not one has told me that in fact they have received only brief communications from the campaign and they have never been counseled to vote for obama and as of now are all holding together for clinton
276707 and as long as its seconded her name goes into nomination

276711 it could be that mikko has a better position on the road tomorrow although the day was perfect for me today
276712 i think we have got the settings on the car quite right now the springs and dampers are perfectly matched it is difficult to know if running first on the road will give us a disadvantage there are some new stages tomorrow which are generally sinuous and twisty but we shall see
276713 generally the day has been very good and my driving felt really nice but seb was faster i dont mind being second and although seb was faster there are still lots of stages tomorrow some of which are new so anything is possible
276714 if any man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninety nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying if it turns out that he finds it truly i say to you he rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine which have not gone astray
276715 note there appears to a be a delineation between republicans embracing mccains new ad as
276716 there are some democrats who think things are going to look a lot different in the makeup of the next congress and why dont we just wait until we are more advantaged
276717 its my hope that theyll come back in september chastened by their constituents and ready to work with republicans on tackling the facing this nation
276718 should go home to their districts and explain their record of obstructing common sense proposals to address the pain at the pump being felt by american consumers and businesses
276719 are here to protect the interests of the oil companies plain and simple
276720 republicans in the congress and the president dont want to do any of the things that would have an impact on gas prices immediately
276721 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us
276722 im never confident they will do anything and im normally right
276723 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
276724 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
276725 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
276726 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
276727 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
276728 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue

276824 i am going to meet with him and if we can work out a deal that is acceptable to bob manny and to us then we will get the fight done
276825 bob and me have a pretty good track record of making big fights i will sit down with bob on wednesday and i think we will know in a half hour if we have a deal or not
276826 there are some deal points which need to be discussed such as the split of the revenues the weight i think the gloves maybe

276831 oscar really wants to do the fight you know oscar
276832 he honestly feels that freddie and pacquiao have been disrespectful
276833 manny is the best fighter in the world pound for pound but manny will see how oscar pulls the trigger in the ring and freddie can sit in the corner and watch oscar hit him
276834 when oscar read freddies comments he was like what the expletive is that he feels challenged now golden boy matchmaker and de la hoyas close friend eric gomez told him its not an easy fight because pacquiao is so strong and fast and so relentless what hes done to marco antonio barrera erik morales david diaz manny doesnt just beat them he destroys them the only one who has pacquiaos number a little bit is juan manuel marquez manny and bob know that which is why the third fight isnt happening but a fight with oscar can happen oscar gave me clear instructions to make the fight with pacquiao not to kill the fight

276842 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
276843 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
276844 as popular or unpopular as it is for as tough or as difficult as it is i think the organization has stood strong

276946 we took the view that we could make the distinction a lot clearer and we could educate investors about the different quality of earnings and the different aspects of earnings
276947 the sec should recommend that the fasb be judicious in issuing new standards and interpretations that expand the use of fair value in areas where it is not already required

276953 it is early in training camp what i feel good about is i believe we have three guys capable of winning games for us in the nfl that is a very good thing it is a good problem to have rather than three years ago when i didnt know if i had a quarterback on our team that could get us a win i feel good about that we are only a little more than over a week into camp were good we are basically on track with what we planned to do from the very beginning it is the only way you can do it when you are trying to find the best guy

276985 ghost in the shell is one of my favorite stories its a genre that has arrived and we enthusiastically welcome it to dreamworks
276986 recently we did a deal for ghost in the shell and were going to do it with steven spielberg and dreamworks were now in the process of working with the writer jamie moss and putting the story together its a complicated film for those who know the property and we have a big challenge ahead of us
276987 ghost in the shell is a passion project of steven spielbergs so it really just had to do with that its really something that hes been in love with for many years
276988 were going to do it as a 3 d film so its something that hes really pushing to help get more theaters built into 3 d using ghost in the shell right now as a symbol that you need to get more 3 d theaters
276989 i have a history of doing these songs where i incorporate the names of labels famous people or animals like i did on animal planet
276990 this time im speaking about cars but im speaking about them in a whole different fashion i start the song off by saying i took her off the floor no money down im talking about a female but im comparing her to a car im not talking about how much my rims cost my soft leather seats the tvs in the headrest and all these things that really have no value or meaning to me
276991 i never focus on what people are listening to or what other guys are doing
276992 since day one its always been about lyrics so i never go into the studio with the idea of making a club song or a radio song or something that females will like it just has to come naturally
276993 its something that people will enjoy and will love to have its needed

277002 yeah all isms sic feed off one another but at the top of the food chain is still the white corporate macho strong ox male not redeemable as far as im concerned i mean classism is determined by sexism because the male decides whether all other isms still exists sic its up to men im just saying that people cant deny any ism or think that some are more or less subordinate except for sexism i still think that in order to expand on all other isms sexism has to be blown wide open but there are thousands of green minds young gullable sic 15 year old boys out there just starting to fall into the grain of what theyve been told of what a man is supposed to be and there are plenty of tools to use the most effective tool is entertainment

277041 im honored to be named president and will enjoy carrying on bills business vision producing innovative and quality products with top performing employees focused solely on customer needs that is as good a business model today as it was in 1975 when bill started this company its a simple idea that weve totally embraced and it works very well for us i am looking forward to bringing wfcos brand of value added service into new markets with new problem solving products

277059 i obama was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative city and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
277060 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
277061 what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families

277071 when we were looking at publishers there were only a handful and we were really excited by the leadership john riccitiello flew to mesquite to talk to us and he is more of a gamer than i think people realise
277072 the questions that he asked and frank gibeau david demartini those guys run the most powerful publisher in the world and theyre all hardcore games they were excited about the title and we felt that ea would be the best partner for us and it wasnt about money
277073 weve made our par 3s longer and tougher narrowed the fairways and really paid attention to the landing areas
277074 weve also tried to make our bunkers more penal and very hazardous plus its difficult to get to the right spots on the greens the hole locations shrink them because of the undulations and shelving
277075 omg weve got to get that guy who outhit pujols yesterday
277076 once again my daughter and son in law have had their freedom and independence taken away and it scares me that their relationship is not going to work if theyre locked behind closed doors
277077 i cant imagine being with someone 24 7 locked in a house because the system took away my freedom and thats what scares me
277078 aw those poor guys what do they do that makes them so tired they sit around waiting to swing the bat and they go to bat maybe four or five times aw thats sooooooo tiring and then they just stand around in the field until they have to pick up that little ball and throw it poor babies its not like theyre playing football
277079 i do watch sports how could i not just for self preservation
277080 to me baseball is in some ways other than my family and wife my life and it always will be
277081 as the years passed he grew overbearing arrogant condescending dismissive and petulant there is only so much anyone can take from a know it all uncle who humorlessly preaches he is the smartest man in the room most viewers have long had their fill of packer
277082 billy packer had become old school and not in the good way of paying attention to detail or studying hard before he would go on the air but in the way of a crotchety old guy who chases neighborhood kids out of the yard what stood out about packer over the last few years was inability to project joy he had one of the most recognizable voices in ncaa tournament history but never sounded as if he was having fun
277083 nobody has been as good at explaining and analyzing a college basketball game his very presence at a game lifted its importance and made it a bigger event than if someone else was calling it
277084 roberts doesnt get much of a lead for a base stealer he really tries to time the pitcher he stays close to the bag so hes assured of not getting picked off he tries to time it and get a walking lead
277085 when you have a coach like leo mazzone its almost like having a celebrity pitching coach because he had all that fame with the great pitchers in atlanta so when mazzone came to baltimore he tried to use the same philosophy that he used in atlanta what has happened with rick kranitz is he has decided to work with each pitcher individually and using each of their own strength
277086 when you look at the lineup of the orioles you see a lot of seventh and second place hitters they dont have a really big bat in the lineup when you get down to the bottom of the lineup youve got a veteran player like jay payton who is an accomplished hitter but youve also got guillermo quiroz and freddie bynum they are players that when youre on your best day those are the guys you should get out
277087 that is heady stuff its stuff that managers shouldnt blurt out unless they believe it because you never want to put young players in that position to try and be that great but jones has improved his defense since spring training hes become a real solid center fielder they picture him as someone who is going to have a lot of power and drive in a lot of runs
277088 i will be doing the highlights for the red states and keith will be doing the highlights for the blue states
277089 the key ingredient we had working together was whatever you thought we were doing out there the actual intent of the program was an attempt by him to crack me up or by me to crack him up as long as we kept that undercurrent going we knew it would be fairly entertaining for the audience
277090 i wanted to work for dick ebersol i wanted to work with bob costas and then you combine that with working with keith ive got collinsworth who is the best analyst in the business so i was walking into a table that was already set well have fun but well have fun because i know all of these people i covered collinsworth when he was a rookie for the bengals
277091 i know he still gets this and i still get this people say all the time that we wish we could see you guys working together as good as he is and as good as i am as opposed to as good as i think i am when we work together were as good as any five people in the business i think thats the magic that is clearly not going to be created in any way shape or form it just happens i feel very fortunate that dan chose to do this and that dick and bob and everybody else signed off on it its very fortunate to get a second chance to make the proverbial first impression
277092 this is one of the more pleasurable announcements that ive been able to make these last 19 years
277093 last year we added one person and the show was a hell of a lot better than it was the first year this year were adding another and i suspect it will get even that much better
277094 i watch with a critical eye but i also watch with great admiration for those who can do it and do it well so i didnt sit there and go i can do that better i had a harder time watching sportscenter ill grant you that you do that for so long you do it for 18 years and then its kind of hard to watch its sort of like brett favre having to watch aaron rodgers with the packers maybe thats what it is i dont know its something along those lines
277095 in talking to bob costas bob brought it up sort of off the cuff and i said id love to approach dick ebersol about it and he said oh ill do that and then he did i talked to keith a couple times on and off and it happened pretty quickly so here i am ready to do some football with keith and certainly with bob and having bob signing off on it was very important because i trusted his judgment being able to sort of handle this and be the conductor in there i look forward to it it brings me back certainly working with keith ive never had a better partner to work with and it should be fun
277096 dans field is football and the super bowl in the years we have the super bowl he also will be involved with us in the olympics starting in vancouver we have not talked about doing anything beyond that principally because hes got a five day a week three hour program and he has four children and hed like to be home on alternate saturdays so at this point we have not talked about anything more largely due to his family desires
277097 i like the two man luge keith and i have done that before
277098 you havent seen matt lauer and al roker together on a luge its quite a site
277099 i was hoping for meredith viera but if al rokers available ill take him
277100 it had nothing to do with keith burning bridges because keith was still working with espn radio
277101 i was still working with espn radio after dan left
277102 it took 18 years but keith is the good one hes the good son
277103 i think its a great idea because it reunites one of the great combinations ever in tv sports ive been in favor of the idea ever since nbc sports reacquired the nfl but we havent been able to work it out until now
277104 just the other day i saw a deadhead sticker on a cadilac a little voice inside my head said dont look back you can never look back
277105 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault
277106 nobody in the history of the world has ever even conceived of making this much less actually made it
277107 i cant testify to the navs high speed handling in the twisties because im not an idiot
277108 well duh high ground clearance good off road tips over easily way to state the obvious frickin rocket scientists
277109 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
277110 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
277111 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
277112 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since
277113 im like a nail stuck in the wrist of their christmas

277133 94 360 invasive mrsa infections occurred in the united states in 2005 these infections were associated with death in 18 650 cases
277134 i think it is very likely that the situation is the same in the u s
277135 weve proven mrsa is in pigs and the marketed pork in canada and we know that its also in u s pigs its inconceivable that it wouldnt also be found in the pork products from those pigs
277136 higher food prices are here to stay i dont know if that means that the current high rate of inflation will continue i just wouldnt expect a substantial retrenchment
277137 its a clear signal to people that resources are scarce

277220 if you play defense you want to go to the number one defense in the country and thats lsu plus they won the national championship last year its hard to turn that down were definitely on the same page they are recruiting me the hardest and i have a good relationship with coach bradley dale peveto
277221 i could make my decision soon or i may wait
277222 i just havent had a chance to go there yet but right now i think theres like an 80 percent chance thats where ill go
277223 if you play defense you want to go to the number one defense in the country and thats lsu plus they won the national championship last year its hard to turn that down
277224 they are recruiting me the hardest and i have a good relationship with coach co defensive coordinator bradley dale peveto hes a good guy and he says that they would just put me in the middle and let me play
277225 id like to play for a team that is united and works for one goal
277226 id also like to go where ill have a chance to win a national championship
277227 i couldnt really afford to go to all the camps and places i wanted to this summer
277228 but they came on strong it seemed very random that they would even recruit me but they are a great program and ive heard a lot of good things about them theyre obviously doing things right up there
277229 ive only heard great things about them i guess more people showed up at their spring game than anywhere else bo pelini
277230 hes a great defensive coach and nebraska is always known for their defense and linebackers
277231 i still like those schools but im mainly looking at schools that have offered me and where i feel i could go and play
277232 if i had to make a decision before midnight i dont want to be thinking about usc ohio state or notre dame because they havent offered
277233 its not realistic they are still recruiting me a little but im not too concerned about that now if they do offer ill think about them again
277234 i really want to watch as many games as i can
277235 i just want to check out the depth charts and watch their defense closely i look for tendencies and see how the team acts on the field

277247 with everything randy has been through in his life this was really a pivotal point for him as he made a vow to be present in his community and help out the kids
277248 the randy foye foundation has a program called assist 4 life piloting in his old elementary school dr
277249 randy chose eight kids whose story was most similar to his own and we have been spending a lot of time with those kids this summer taking them on trips etc randy spoke to all 70 students in the two grades at the end of the past school year and they were fired up about having him back and participating in the contest the students we chose will be introduced at the gala we had a fun day taking them shopping for outfits at short hills mall last week in fact the schools literacy coach joyce mccree who accompanies the students on our trips told us that one of the students hadnt smiled in almost two months and on the day of the shopping trip he was beaming the entire time she thanked us for what she called the small miracles that randy is already creating just by being a presence in these childrens lives we will be providing mentorship throughout the school year while randy is away

277256 customers are concerned over speculation that interest rates would be increased
277257 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
277258 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
277259 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
277260 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
277261 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
277262 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
277263 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
277264 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
277265 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
277266 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone
277267 its happened to my children four times its cruelty beyond words
277268 the goal of the organization is to have a competent and professional group of armed volunteers ready to respond to a threat at a moments notice in any area where jews reside
277269 we do not carry out demonstrations or political activity of any kind as we have no political agenda our agenda is to protect jews wherever and whenever necessary and by any means needed
277270 felt a false sense of security in the united states
277271 because historically there has been less anti semitism than in other countries but there have been incidents neo nazi terrorist attacks arab terrorist attacks jews have to be vigilant
277272 the threat is not from the american people or government
277273 terrorist sleeper cells that want to target jews these people are very dangerous and the fbi issues warnings against them very often
277274 the average american is friendly to jews but were worried about those individuals on the periphery of society
277275 we realized there is a need for this kind of organization and as israeli combat veterans living in the us we have the skills and ability to respond to this
277276 we believe all jews in the us must be legally armed and trained
277277 and towards this goal we hold paramilitary training camps to train and equip jewish american youth
277278 are 100 legal and in compliance with all federal state and local laws
277279 we strongly believe in the constitutional right to bear arms and we express this right to its fullest
277280 well connected with the new york police and fire departments
277281 all members of the law enforcement community to join in our life saving activities
277282 we are all legally armed and carry radios and cellphones
277283 as we need to be constantly ready to respond to any incident
277284 know your rights and learn how every american can and must be legally armed and how to express the second amendment
277285 we wouldnt have a problem with non jews coming either
277286 239 196 bill this year after irs auditors found that employees with cellphones were not keeping logs uc san diego had to shell out 186 471 for the same reason

277288 weve got a few songs were kicking around that might ring the bell
277289 you are overpaid you have overstayed your welcome overplayed your hand with microsoft will you do the honourable thing and step down
277290 there was never any doubt about the position of this board and its openness to do a deal at no point did the board despite rumour or speculation did we ever resist we actively engaged with them
277291 they verbally in an offhand comment and this is important they said there may be a few more dollars on the table they never communicated this to the board or in writing
277292 and to this day i do not know why they did that
277293 at the end of june the fomc predicted that the unemployment rate would hit between 5 5 and 5 7 per cent in the fourth quarter little more than a month later it has already broken through the top end of expectations
277294 the lords found that the government had the right to take action we have called for a full review of the evidence by the sfo and i think they will come to the conclusion we have done nothing wrong
277295 it will never go horrendously wrong when youre offering the cheapest fares in europe we just have to keep flying more aircraft opening up more routes and offering people more cheap flights
277296 we are the perfect airline for the recession you dont want to waste any money at the moment on overpriced flights that will be delayed out of heathrow while your bags are lost
277297 we have guaranteed no fuel surcharges whatever oil increases there are
277298 we paid 60 000 to their charity but we got more than 5 million worth of free publicity so were happy
277299 im available to kiss and make up with mrs sarkozy any time she wants
277300 willie walsh the chief executive of ba is the one with the high fares and the fuel surcharges
277301 people may pretend they dont fly ryanair but everyone does it tony blair half the royal family if i showed you our passenger list wed have half the house of lords lots of mps
277302 green protesters are our best passengers theyre always flying off to their demonstrations the chatterati hate mass tourism but they travel with us to their italian villas they all love a bargain if they use it why should they exclude others its just snobbery
277303 i hate this censorious attitude to what people do if you think theyre setting a bad example i would point you to lunatics like robert mugabe he didnt go on a stag night he starved his entire people
277304 eventually therell be one last british airways flight with a bunch of old toffee nosed snobs on it but all the kids of the toffee nosed snobs will be flying on ryanair
277305 low fares have transformed europe politically theres much more movement of young people across the continent weve done more for european integration than any old fart politician in brussels therell be no going back to the old school of british airways charging you a fortune for the privilege of going on a one hour flight
277306 typical political posturing englands a wonderful country but it isnt right for every family or every holiday sometimes you need to get away
277307 david cameron may be holidaying in cornwall but he flew halfway round the world just to see some huskies brown is only staying in britain because he is too frightened that if he leaves someone will nick his job
277308 the green lobby are like those old guys in the medieval market place shouting about the end of the world climate change is not the biggest threat to mankind if it is why is the summer so crappy
277309 bugger bicycles i drive a car and a tractor i have a herd of 600 cows on my farm in ireland who probably make a more damaging impact on the environment than my airplanes do
277310 this global warming nonsense is no different to some of the more lunatic movements youve had throughout history they were excommunicating galileo 500 years ago for suggesting the earth might go round the sun now the nutbag ecologists say were boiling the planet to extinction this is just the crazy idea for the first decade of the 21st century
277311 all this climate change stuff is an inevitable byproduct of a ten year period of economic growth and low unemployment now we have a recession youll hear an awful lot less about the bloody environment
277312 they call them eco taxes but thats just spin its just taking more money off us
277313 air transport accounts for less than 2 per cent of co2 emissions
277314 marine transport accounts for 5 per cent double the aviation industry but you dont hear these nutbags saying lets tax the crap out of the ferries do you
277315 we can put more passengers in our planes we have a fleet of new aircraft that are more fuel efficient we take less weight entire brazilian rainforests of waste come off bas aircraft with all that extra packaging the ancient planes the waste of space in business class
277316 where do all these offsets go corrupt african dictatorships and staff in new york the money doesnt actually go to planting trees
277317 david cameron can hug trees because he wont have to do much to get into power but it is not a way to run a country
277318 its just government by poll and spin doctor thatcher and blair didnt dither they just made their decisions
277319 we are in a recession governments have to take the hard decisions cut public spending reduce taxation at ryanair we had a pay freeze announced redundancies cut flights from expensive airports but were still guaranteeing low prices and we will bounce back when oil prices settle down
277320 we will soon end up with four large airlines in europe ryanair will be the largest then lufthansa air france and ba but we will be the only ones keeping the big buggers honest
277321 i dont like to go abroad on holiday im an irish peasant farmer i dont like sunshine when i can stay at home in ireland what the hell would i want to go away for
277322 a sharp drop in discretionary spending is having a direct impact on insolvency figures with leisure companies featuring highly as well as property developers
277323 company liquidations seem certain to trend significantly higher over the coming months given that recession is now looking more likely than not
277324 businesses that a year ago had been able to paper over the cracks are now being fully exposed unfortunately this feels like just the beginning
277325 the outlook for the uk economy has worsened as 2008 has progressed and the degree of uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased there is a risk that the current economic and market turbulence could continue for a significant period of time and a risk of further uncertainty and contagion impacting the valuation of alliance amp leicester
277326 the proposal provided greater stability and greater certainty in uncertain times
277327 as with abbey in the early part of this century small banks lacking the skills set in capital markets are the ones being hurt most by credit events
277328 first half earnings at alliance amp leicester were almost completely wiped out by treasury losses as well as the expensive funding facility we fear this will mean a repeat performance at bradford amp bingley reporting on august 29
277329 the potential read across to bradford amp bingley particularly with respect to margins does not look good

277335 most ceos in healthcare are accountants who have bolted on the nursery bit im the reverse
277336 i was managing director with an agreement with john that if he ever decided he wanted to depart he would give me the opportunity to launch a management buyout
277337 i decided that as i had never had it i wouldnt miss it
277338 i got a phone call and was told dont go on holiday for six months come and see the business
277339 ive been recruited for two reasons to grow the business and take it forward into additional new business streams and to improve the performance of the existing core business

277342 we assume 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
277343 my pioneer dvr 420hs has an analog tuner thus when the digital transition kicks in the tuner on my dvd recorder will no longer work most dvd recorders out there right now have analog tuners so they will all be obsolete
277344 models without tuners are fine for use with cable boxes or satellite tuners
277345 valencia cf has made no agreement nor are they involved in any negotiations to transfer david villa and david jimenez silva to any club in spain or abroad
277346 it is completely untrue i have informed both the players and their agents in an official and clear manner that the firm intention of the club is for both of the players to stay with us and see out their contracts
277347 a known fan and member of real madrid something he has never been of our club
277348 last week we could have stopped the transfer of david villa to real madrid
277349 there are family reasons which have also been taken into account
277350 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract

277352 i never told anyone i would be leaving this club never ever im very happy weve found a solution
277353 i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family
277354 when we started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving this club and he knew my desire
277355 but i said slavery with young people european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 year old boys and bring them to the big clubs
277356 i have never mentioned that for ronaldo but the press they have distorted it
277357 i think in football there is too much modern slavery transferring players or buying players here and there and putting them somewhere and we are trying now to intervene in such cases
277358 they real madrid and manchester united will solve this problem

277382 our minimum wage adjusting for inflation is lower than it was in the 1950s and why is it one of the things going on is that income and wealth inequality have gone back to the 1920s we are back at levels that we saw right before the great depression
277383 if you look into the religions they have this deep idea of human dignity and the source of dignity being conscience this capacity for searching for the meaning of life and that leads us directly to the idea of respect because if conscience is this deep and valuable source of searching for meaning then we all have it whether were agreeing or disagreeing and we all ought to respect it and respect it equally in one another
277384 the slavery that survived long past emancipation was an offense permitted by the nation perpetrated across an enormous region over many years and involving thousands of extraordinary characters some of that story is in fact lost but every incident in this book is true each character was a real person every direct quotation comes from a sworn statement or a record documented at the time
277385 for a long time during the middle of the twentieth century it wasnt even clear what it meant to be a judicial conservative then with great suddenness during the presidency of ronald reagan judges and lawyers on the right found a voice and an agenda their goals reflected and reinforced the political goals of the conservative wing of the republican party

277400 this was not a random shooting these four individuals know each other and apparently have some differences between them
277401 a team of u s marshals and jso officers went in to get castaneda but he wasnt paying all that much attention to them his focus was on this he was calm cool and collected playing a video game he didnt have a care in the world
277402 he was on the run since this incident happened he knew he was a wanted man and thought that he could hide out here in jacksonville and keep a low profile
277403 i guess i was just outraged that somebody was doing this to me
277404 to report incidents of identity theft and mortgage fraud that had been perpetrated against them
277405 with the materials that they felt were relevant to their presentation to the fbi
277406 people who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster
277407 all of a sudden i saw it come down it sounded like a forest of trees cracking and breaking

277443 iran is continuing to advance toward a military nuclear capability and is heading towards a major breakthrough
277444 for us such a situation that iran will have a nuclear power is an existential threat and from the state of israel point of view it is unacceptable
277445 our estimation is that already by 2009 iran will reach enrichment capability and as soon as 2010 will have option to reach uranium production at military levels
277446 one thing is clear is iranians are continuing their policy of buying time and so far they are succeeding
277447 we all know time is a decisive element in our ability to change the picture and remove the iranian threat
277448 and the window of influence is becoming smaller and i believe about to close

277470 and i say to you whoever divorces his wife except for immorality and marries another woman commits adultery
277471 god has no place within these walls just like facts have no place within organized religion
277472 is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason
277473 that at the beginning the creator made them male and female
277474 thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind it is abomination
277475 for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words
277476 then the lord said to moses write down these words for in accordance with these words i have made a covenant with you and with israel moses was there with the lord forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant the ten commandments
277477 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god
277478 now therefore why tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved even as they
277479 you are not going to tell me it is wrong
277480 and i say to you whoever divorces his wife except for immorality and marries another woman commits adultery
277481 allowing gay marriage means society approves of something they consider to be fundamentally wrong
277482 allowing gay marriage means the majority of society approves of something the
277483 all the candidates are sinners mccains sin is hardly a reason for legitimizing another
277484 allowing gay marriage means the majority of society approves of something the minority considers to be fundamentally wrong
277485 having laws that prohibit legitimizing a lifestyle that is fundamentally opposed to the beliefs of the majority doesnt mean that everyone who supports the law claims to be sinless
277486 does marriage only apply to one man and one woman what about all the godly people in the bible that had multiple wives what about the men who never got married are they sinners
277487 having laws that prohibit legitimizing a lifestyle that is fundamentally opposed to the beliefs of the majority doesnt mean that everyone who supports the law claims to be sinless

277496 what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
277497 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
277498 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
277499 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
277500 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
277501 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
277502 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
277503 the hands that once picked cotton can now pick a president
277504 he was never really an anonymous sperm donor he always was present in the childrens lives
277505 kind of a smooth and what i would consider a supportive relationship in terms of the kids
277506 and he wasnt interested in the accompanying responsibility to provide financial support for the kids
277507 what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before

277519 this really helps us connect with the soldiers on a whole different level
277520 were letting them know that were all here were thinking about them
277521 so far weve collected almost 20 000 worth of equipment and donations
277522 its amazing how many people have wanted to take part
277523 its a great way to kill time and soldiers love that they can just slip the games into a pocket or a bag
277524 it lets the military know we are receiving support from home and people are thinking about us serving in iraq and afghanistan
277525 peter and i admire what these men and women overseas go through every day we felt we needed to do something to let them know we care

277537 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
277538 it was a comfortable lap but sometimes a comfortable lap is a slow one not this time
277539 we have made a lot of progress since the season started
277540 last night i was getting ready to go to sleep and thinking about today and different things about the racing and what im going to be looking for out of my race car
277541 last time when we came here i had no idea what to expect
277542 we had an opportunity to go to dover last year and try to qualify for the race
277543 i think we practiced like 38th fast and then went out to qualify and i think ended up 47th out of 49 car that were there that day we were pretty disappointed about that
277544 but then we go back there in june and we qualified 16th and we got a top 20 run 18th at the end of the day
277545 i think that just shows how much easier it is the second time you go to a track and just know what to expect out of these cars and what youre looking for out of the car
277546 obviously coming back to a track for me is just experience and gives you confidence
277547 but as a team were working through this new car and being able to come back with a baseline starting point is only going to help us to improve our performance
277548 you get an hour and then you qualify and where you qualify really dictates how your weekend is going to go
277549 not having to worry about figuring out the racing line and figuring out what you need to do that first hour and be able to just go out there and work on the car and work on your qualifying trim is going to be a big thing
277550 the unknown of what to expect from the new car as the races go on is going to be a little bit less now that were going back the second time to these places
277551 last year i couldnt even breathe getting in the car for qualifying because it was so nerve racking for me
277552 now i have the confidence in the team that we have a fast enough car to just go out there and put a lap down and not just make the race but qualifying in the top 10 and run up front
277553 its definitely a lot better but i dont want to do it much longer
277554 the track is fine its perfect its the same track for everyone
277555 the more bumps and the more patches and cracks and character it has i think the better thats my take on racetracks is that theyre not supposed to be perfect
277556 we think about it every week top 10 finishes are what we need to do to secure our spot in the chase and go to new york for the postseason awards ceremony and all that were working hard at it
277557 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
277558 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
277559 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
277560 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
277561 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
277562 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue
277563 realistically that track did something that weve never seen it do before and thats not take rubber
277564 that is somehow different from what we experienced in 06 and 07
277565 the whole combination of that tire the car of tomorrow on that racetrack caused that right rear tire to wear like we had never seen before the fronts were similar to what we had seen in 06 and 07 the wear improved on the front but the rear never got any better
277566 it doesnt matter the first ranking i want to be healthy
277567 if its going to happen it will happen but at the moment i dont deserve that spot i am not in the best shape
277568 i was feeling good and i was hitting the ball well but then all of a sudden i just got exhausted completely lost my concentration
277569 im still not in the best physical shape i felt dizzy on the court i needed a little bit of time after the match to come to life again im still not feeling that strong
277570 in the first games i was nervous and made a lot of mistakes then i found my rhythm and started believing in myself
277571 the talks between mr gilani and mr singh will mark the highest level interaction between the two countries in 15 months
277572 the ceasefire is in operation for around five years and it is in the mutual interest of pakistan and india to protect it
277573 we will not allow that because the isi is directly working under the prime minister
277574 rejecting afghan and indian allegations he said that isi is a disciplined organisation and a national asset responsible for the security of the country
277575 pakistan on friday denied a newspaper report that its intelligence service helped plan a bombing of indias embassy in kabul that killed at least 41 people
277576 im very very very excited to be going in its a great opportunity a great challenge i want to support rex i miss him so much and i really really want to see him
277577 i want success every time i take the field i dont play percentage football
277578 im fit but this knee is weary after so many years of football during which it has picked up injury a few times the latest being a few months ago but when the coach asked me to go there i was more than happy
277579 they are not doing badly sunil chhetri has improved a lot and has started to enjoy the game at the international level others are too young and will mature with time so i wouldnt say theres a vacuum
277580 i dont think they turkmenistan will have a psychological edge over us we now know we have to win and will play accordingly they have won big all right but every game is a new game both teams will start afresh
277581 we dont want to frighten people we want them to take precautions
277582 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
277583 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
277584 my own take on all the available reports is that they suggest a problem to be concerned about
277585 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
277586 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
277587 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
277588 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
277589 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
277590 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
277591 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin
277592 i would likely have brought the case in for autopsy
277593 my familys worried ive got alzheimers but i know i havent
277594 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
277595 poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand service
277596 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
277597 raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
277598 i agree that we do have jurisdiction in general over these areas however we do not have any rules governing internet network management to enforce
277599 we now look forward to executing on our strategy and continuing to build our great company last year yahoo s board of directors and management took steps to thoroughly reexamine the companys direction and to improve the companys performance since then yahoo has made significant strides in executing on its strategy performing particularly well in light of the challenging circumstances of the past six months our board looks forward to continuing to work with management to maximize value for all stockholders
277600 we are at a unique point in our history where we have the eyes of the world focused on our company and tracking our performance we are redoubling our commitment to driving sustained profitable growth for our stockholders the value inherent in yahoo s unique collection of assets is truly extraordinary and the progress weve made on our initiatives this year signals our ability to capitalize on the underlying potential of these assets
277601 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
277602 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
277603 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
277604 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
277605 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
277606 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
277607 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
277608 who are open to doing something on the production side
277609 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
277610 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
277611 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
277612 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
277613 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
277614 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
277615 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
277616 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
277617 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
277618 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
277619 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
277620 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
277621 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
277622 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
277623 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
277624 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
277625 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
277626 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
277627 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
277628 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
277629 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
277630 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
277631 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
277632 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
277633 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
277634 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
277635 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
277636 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
277637 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
277638 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
277639 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
277640 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
277641 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
277642 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
277643 creo que el decreto argentino con nuevos impuestos a los fondos va a profundizar el mal clima que reina en el mercado de capitales
277644 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
277645 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
277646 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
277647 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
277648 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
277649 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
277650 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
277651 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
277652 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
277653 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
277654 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
277655 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
277656 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
277657 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
277658 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
277659 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
277660 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
277661 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
277662 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
277663 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
277664 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
277665 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
277666 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
277667 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
277668 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
277669 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
277670 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
277671 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
277672 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
277673 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
277674 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
277675 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
277676 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
277677 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
277678 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
277679 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
277680 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
277681 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
277682 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
277683 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
277684 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
277685 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
277686 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
277687 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
277688 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
277689 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
277690 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
277691 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
277692 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

277726 these are not issues which you could keep any substantial percentage of your constituency awake to listen to but there are very strong feelings about them
277727 we knew that there was a great deal of sympathy for reform in certain parts of the high tech community and certain parts of the financial community and there were concerns about it from some old line companies and pharmaceutical companies

277803 iran is continuing to advance toward a military nuclear capability and is heading towards a major breakthrough
277804 for us such a situation that iran will have a nuclear power is an existential threat and from the state of israel point of view it is unacceptable
277805 our estimation is that already by 2009 iran will reach enrichment capability and as soon as 2010 will have option to reach uranium production at military levels
277806 one thing is clear is iranians are continuing their policy of buying time and so far they are succeeding
277807 we all know time is a decisive element in our ability to change the picture and remove the iranian threat

278012 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates but that i think that what people are really concerned about what theyre looking for is fundamental change on the economy things that are going to help their families live out the american dream there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phoney allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
278013 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american

278044 pride lust of the flesh and unmerciful conduct at a time of prosperity were the leading sins of sodom and of these the rulers of jerusalem and the crowd that was subject to them and worthy of them were equally guilty now

278055 holy practice is the aim of that eternal election which is the first ground of the bestowment of all true grace holy practice is not the ground and reason of election as is supposed by the arminians who imagine that god elects men to everlasting life upon a foresight of their good works but it is the aim and end of election god does not elect men because he foresees they will be holy but that he may make them and that they may be holy

278074 for you i am lifting a nearly ten year god embargo
278075 they got rid of rebecca they were getting rid of me
278076 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
278077 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
278078 were not asking him to fill those shoes specifically were asking him to be a member of a winning baseball team with the emphasis on the last word
278079 things got to the point where they had to do something and they did
278080 things escalated to degrees where something had to be done either way either way i think its a relief that theres closure to something thats been going on for the last week or 10 days im just relieved theres an actual solution which there was going to be regardless on this day
278081 i feel like this did have to happen sometimes you make decisions regardless of whether you got a worse player or better player out of that deal it makes your team as a whole better i think thats what their decisions was based on that feeling of camaraderie and 25 guys playing for the same goal
278082 as soon as 2010 iran will have the option to reach uranium production at military levels
278083 it is a race against time and time is winning
278084 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
278085 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
278086 using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues
278087 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
278088 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
278089 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
278090 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
278091 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking sen
278092 pointing out your opponents worldwide celebrity is not the low road and neither is pointing out that he opposes oil drilling and supports higher taxes
278093 my independence hasnt always made me friends in washington i was not elected ms congeniality in the united states senate
278094 my concern with sen obama is that on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
278095 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
278096 you havent heard a positive thing out of that campaign in a month all they do is try to run me down
278097 were in the middle of photography right now were shooting out in new mexico weve brought some of the cast here were going to share some of the picture with you shortly were really looking forward to it just looking out at this audience makes me realize that this whole thing began with listening we listened to the fans everybody wanted to look at the future we werent excited about making t4 we were excited about making a new beginning and indeed this picture is post judgment day to get a look at those worlds that the previous pictures only teased and that was the reason for making this picture
278098 i made sure to talk to jim cameron and of course arnold schwarzenegger we hired stan winston may he rest in peace as you will see his designs are all over the picture
278099 who you might now from a little picture called the dark knight and then we needed an actor and we knew the challenge we were facing was a challenge of credibility it was the privilege of the audience to say hey i dont know i dont know about that i dont know about this mcg guy i dont know what their intentions are with this movie so i wanted to protect the movie and protect all of you by hiring the most credible actor of his generation christian bale i can report back to you fairly after weve shot a lot footage and been through a lot together out there i the deserts of new mexico hes doing a great great job
278100 were shooting the picture with the picture first at all times
278101 i know theres been some talk about a pg 13 rating and its interesting because there are two people in the world who would care about the rating of this picture one guy his name is jeff robinoff and another guy named jeff blake and ive been given their blessing to make the picture and if its a rated r picture its a rated r picture and thats that
278102 im going to call our collective friend in japan christian bale hes working on promoting the dark knight i told him if you didnt yell loud enough you were just gong to get the panel and not the footage
278103 we wanted it to be tactile we wanted it to be real were making the future look a little different by shooting the film with color stock but treating it with as much silver as you would traditionally treat black and white film we want everything to feel different and rejuvenated and exciting and credible at all times
278104 but there is also the issue of this picture taking place in 2018 the schwarzenegger model the t 800 is from 2029 therefore skynets not there yet theyre still doing the research and development the machines havent come to a place of proficiency that were accustomed to we see the becoming of skynet we see the state of the war in that period
278105 christians a very passionate and dedicated actor you go toe to toe with him you better have your fucking game on youre going toe to toe with fucking batman
278106 you need an actor who can stand up in a two shot to christian
278107 and thats not easily done and so many actors as we know in their late 20s early 30s theyre real thin theyre real fashionable and we needed someone tough someone tough someone we could believe in
278108 thats one of the joys of making the picture we get to see machines that we call harvesters transports aerostats hydrobots and theyre done in a greasy grimy brutal soviet tank design language that we saw giger jim cameron and ridley scott do so well in the alien pictures ours is not a clean comfortable future its a very difficult future filled with duress and you see these giant machines stomping through the landscape and harvesting people for their nefarious purposes so yeah theres a lot of hardware worship weve got ilms best on it and i cant wait to show you guys that we purposely held that back
278109 we definitely play with the notion of fate bryce has an interesting physical expression of fate and free will
278110 one would assume if i drop these cups that theyre going to hit the table right so what i demonstrated to mcg one day is that you can drop the cups but you can catch them with the other hand so you can say that your destiny in to hit the table but your free will can divert any destiny that may be in place
278111 one thing we want to do is protect the mythology of the first two movies i wasnt going to sign on if we were going to disregard what jim cameron had done what weve been trying to do is look deeply into those movies take what they have to say about fighting about the future about the destiny of man and hopefully kind of advance it
278112 answering both of those questions would deprive all of us of the joy of the release of the picture
278113 hopefully in that statement you realize where were headed in regard to both questions
278114 michael biehn in the terminator is fucking awesome and well see how he became that awesome and how he got to the point where linda hamilton would sleep with him
278115 and i broke it down and saw who this guy was and the most interesting thing is to see where this guy came from so i think what you see in this film is the development of this guy becoming a hero and seeing that he had the same aspects as a young man he was still down to fight for what he thought was right hed still fight for the human race you can see that the environment hes growing up in is just hellish but what you see in this environment is a guy of such pure spirit
278116 our approach has always been that of what chris nolan did with the batman movies
278117 i dont think that chris or anyone involved in that picture would characterize batman begins as batman 5 were going to honor the mythology were going to begin again and its certainly going to be the story that youre most familiar with but in the spirit of time travel and in no fate but what you make you can take a little bit of license here and there to tell the most compelling story possible
278118 their professionalism was something i learned from over the past couple years its something a lot of people will have to carry on
278119 contest putting viewers in control of creating the next hero from scratch
278120 an upscale two tone decor makes for an attractive interior
278121 classic jeeps largest most luxurious suv and it sports new configurations for the 2008 model year ranging from the base sport model to the loaded overland with the limited filling the gap between the two
278122 bears a striking resemblance to the formers beloved and boxy design
278123 the commanders shape made it instantly recognizable as a jeep when it arrived in early 2005 and it remains fresh today
278124 sports cabin is more rugged than rich appropriate for a vehicle with off road pretensions
278125 extra trim and leather upholstery creates a more upscale ambiance
278126 an upscale two tone decor makes for an attractive interior
278127 dashboards upper sections have exposed allen head screws theres no shortage of a c vents and most surfaces are hard to the touch
278128 helped by an alert automatic transmission the v6 has surprising spirit
278129 capable not only off road but on highways and byways too
278130 its off road prowess is a force to be reckoned with and it tows a stout 7 400 pounds
278131 the base jeep commander sport gets its pep from a standard 3 7 liter v 6 while this engine is a decent source of motivation in smaller jeeps its barely adequate in the 4 800 pound commander
278132 helped by an alert automatic transmission the v6 has surprising spirit with adequate power off the line and around town
278133 accelerating easily to highway speeds with smooth linear power and a burly exhaust sound well into the upper revs
278134 notably less refined than the v 6 or 5 7 liter v 8
278135 it shifts quite early in most situations and around town theres a discernable lag as it moves from gear to gear
278136 much more agreeable with hassle free kickdown for easy passing
278137 although not quite as capable off road as the smaller suvs in its size class the commander is a superb trail buster able to tackle rock strewn paths and steep mountain tracks without breaking a sweat
278138 three four wheel drive systems are available and all three earn jeeps trail rated designation
278139 a low range gear for off roading is standard on limited and overland optional on sport
278140 has good straightline stability but its tall build results in body lean that prompts lots of slowing down for tight turns
278141 prolonged curves induce plenty of body roll and the suv feels especially top heavy if its loaded with people and cargo
278142 ample headroom legroom and shoulder space for even large adults but flat seat bottoms lack support for longer trips
278143 the standard eight way power drivers seat has lots of travel
278144 the cramped 3rd row suits only grade schoolers and is overly complicated to access
278145 generous space is made more useful by a wide flat floor and large hatch opening
278146 a pocketed shelf sits above the glove compartment and there are several nooks around the gearshift to stash cell phones or parking stubs
278147 the silver plastic surrounding the center controls and window switches is respectable in quality
278148 too much hard plastic for an suv in this price range
278149 road and wind noise stay in check on the highway but the commanders poor aerodynamics mean crosswinds can catch drivers off guard
278150 standard safety features include side curtain airbags for all three rows
278151 thick roof pillars and theater style seating combine to block rear visibility almost entirely
278152 stability system uses chryslers electronic roll mitigation which attempts to intuit an imminent rollover and trigger preventative braking measures
278153 thick roof pillars and theater style seating combine to block rear visibility almost entirely
278154 a few more kid friendly features and a more powerful v 8
278155 a low range gear for off roading is standard on limited and overland
278156 automatic dual zone climate control power adjustable pedals rain sensing automatic wipers satellite radio and a power sunroof with twin skylights for those ensconced in the second row
278157 will appreciate a few new kid friendly options this year among them are sirius satellite tv which debuted in minivans not long ago it streams mobile content from nickelodeon the disney channel and cartoon network to the commanders rear flip down screen
278158 chryslers mygig infotainment system incorporates a hard drive that can store some 1 600 songs enough that you can leave your ipod at home a navigation system can be coupled with it and the system includes real time traffic monitoring provided you subscribe to sirius satellite radio which streams the data in
278159 the point is yes the outlook in the u s is weakening but with that said sun is underperforming against that backdrop

278176 the zvbox allows internet tv watchers to move from the small screen of their computers and the discomfort of the home office to the superior viewing experience of their hdtvs and the comfort of the couch zvbox is the first device that allows consumers to watch anything they can get online or on their computers on all the hdtvs in their homes by simply connecting to the monitor output of the computer zvbox turns the computer screen into a new high definition tv channel called zv which it then localcasts across the existing coaxial cable wiring to all hdtvs in the home
278177 we are pleased that sales for our major business segments security products and furniture components during the second quarter of 2008 essentially matched the level experienced in 2007 softness by historically strong customers within these segments was offset by focusing on new products and providing higher levels of security for markets susceptible to increased theft in lean times
278178 however our smaller segment providing components to the high performance marine market mirrored that industrys sales drop in that area as well we continue to focus on these relatively recent acquisitions to expand in house manufacturing capabilities and to design and introduce new products we believe these activities throughout our company will serve us well as we work our way through current economic conditions and will prepare us for expansion when the economy improves

278186 nobody in the world would deny that that is an ad to hurt pat mccrory and elect bev perdue
278187 if she thought it was bad if she wanted to be positive shed step out and say hey i dont like this
278188 we dont like this activity but if its going to happen lets stay focused on issue differences
278189 you need to read between the lines and see what theyre doing
278190 theyre trying to buy an outcome and its up to us to protect it the outcome is our outcome not theirs
278191 when the application store launched it was a learning process not only for us as a publisher and a developer but for everyone that works on the application store and learning whats things are going to work and what things arent going to work
278192 were looking at this as a marathon not as a sprint out of the gates
278193 how do you weed through hundreds if not thousands of games six months down the road and finally the ones that are cream of the crop
278194 with ds and psp theres an approval process to get a certain quality of game onto the device its really going to be up to the consumer to speak loudly about which games they want to be playing and really communicate that out to the network of thousands of consumers
278195 the biggest fear is that youre going to have a great game a title that is just loved but it isnt positioned properly and just falls off the app store because nobody knows about it
278196 apple could become a victim of their own success where everybody wants to develop for the platform but how do you really ensure those games are really getting out there and being downloaded
278197 the biggest fear is that youre going to have a great game that falls off the app store because nobody knows about it
278198 yes youd like to see apple show some control but on the other hand it allows for independents we were all pretty small at one time so having that opportunity its tough to knock that
278199 its kind of been a little bit of a race to the bottom
278200 i like the fact that some of the titles are holding fast and steady at the 9 99 price point if a dorm room kid developers a 99 cent texas hold em game puts it up on the platform and then starts getting downloaded the game may not be as good as say a product from us which is at 4 99 its a challenge i would prefer to see some sort of stable pricing model but i dont think thats something were going to see in the future

278202 one of the services we do offer our customers is riders edge new rider course its basically a motorcycle safety course
278203 familiarize yourself with it before you go out on the main roads and do the driving
278204 i dont recommend getting on it for the first time and going down minnesota avenue or 41st street
278205 they dont always see us when were out on motorcycles or scooters
278206 anytime you see a potential hazard you really need to pay attention to it
278207 well they got the legislation passed for electric cars so its just a matter of time before youll have to have a license for these which we encourage you should
278208 i would definitely do it ive never heard of it but i think it would definitely help with before school
278209 everybodys out buying stuff i think that would be a great idea
278210 i look around and i go to sales and i have three kids in school and prices matter they do
278211 i dont know it would make a huge difference it might be burdensome with paper work
278212 i can see it working better for some businesses over others
278213 a lot of people can do it with one hand but theres no way you cant control your car when youre doing it
278214 for me sitting high in a truck or bus you can watch people
278215 but if youre sitting in a car next to somebody theres no way you can tell what theyre doing
278216 i dont think theyll stop it until people have been made an example of pulled over and stopped doing it
278217 their co payments for each prescription range from about 2 25 for a generic product to about 5 65 cents for a brand name drug thats all they pay even if the drug cost hundreds of dollars retail so the savings are tremendous
278218 check in to it theres people theres help out there if its available you should take advantage of it because it is very helpful
278219 two weeks may appear as too short but its not inflexible im sure that the facilitators will adjust as the progress moves forward
278220 the digital assets that people have are clearly climbing and with that comes the potential need for a home server
278221 there needs to be something beyond backup to make the home server story come alive for consumers
278222 the server category has to demonstrate application extensibility where its projecting things you couldnt do previously rather than just being a source of backup and storage it needs to proactively help people with their media
278223 if you have to buy these yourself the trend is going to be slower but when service providers latch onto this and let you just add 5 to your 100 monthly cable bill its not a noticeable impact then youre going to see some action
278224 lcds and plasmas cant produce 100 percent of the grayscales in the original image oleds can
278225 you could have a paper thin wall size oled that displays video shows photographs or provides ambient light with a flick of a switch
278226 now that there is certainty that the vast majority of cable customers will have access to a tru2way system we can all build products that we can sell with confidence at retail
278227 unlike sony vizio is not going to endorse tru2way unless the cable industry can convince us that it will save our customers money and not just increase cables profitability
278228 the question will be will it add to the price

278234 in 2008 we ll probably see more asian americans at the ballot box because of large numbers
278235 i ve noticed my students are much more interested this year
278236 in local and state elections asian americans are very critical of who wins and loses
278237 if they are concentrated in large numbers that makes a difference and around d c and virginia they are starting to emerge as a potentially important vote
278238 with less loyalty you get fewer bloods versus crips and more blood versus blood or crip versus crip things
278239 if you are selling drugs for the bloods it doesn t go up the food chain
278240 if they live with us work with us and pay taxes like us it is fair that they could decide like us through the right to vote
278241 the question presents a variety of difficulties which depend on the laws and situation of each country

278247 can an america whose cities are in some parts indistinguishable from third world slums and whose already large underclass continues to fall behind the rest of society maintain the moral authority required for world leadership
278248 large numbers of blacks and other minorities fall outside the productive economy and have become alienated from mainstream society
278249 america has not done well at incorporating blacks and hispanics into the work force or tapping their full productive potential
278250 even more menacing to the security prospects of the western alliance than was the cold war
278251 demography is the study of human numbers but it is the human characteristics of those numbers that define world events what is called a demographic problem may better be described as a moral and intellectual emphasis added problem that takes demographic form indeed divorced from an understanding of the people behind the data population studies can provide little insight
278252 the fact that so many middle income homes managed to find the money to buy the game having already purchased the expensive hardware to drive it indicates that the middle class is in no imminent danger of disappearance

278259 iran is continuing to advance toward a military nuclear capability and is heading towards a major breakthrough
278260 for us such a situation that iran will have a nuclear power is an existential threat and from the state of israel point of view it is unacceptable
278261 our estimation is that already by 2009 iran will reach enrichment capability and as soon as 2010 will have option to reach uranium production at military levels
278262 one thing is clear is iranians are continuing their policy of buying time and so far they are succeeding
278263 we all know time is a decisive element in our ability to change the picture and remove the iranian threat
278264 and the window of influence is becoming smaller and i believe about to close

278266 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
278267 for more than any other reason because it is the absolute highest quality image capture system available
278268 what that means for chris is he can put on quite a show it makes a much more epic event of the movie
278269 for me at a time when a lot of filmmakers are choosing to go with lower resolution digital systems it gives me an opportunity to use the highest quality film negative available you expose 65mm and it is printed to 70mm

278286 we are at a unique point in our history where we have the eyes of the world focused on our company and tracking our performance we are redoubling our commitment to driving sustained profitable growth for our stockholders the value inherent in yahoo s unique collection of assets is truly extraordinary and the progress weve made on our initiatives this year signals our ability to capitalize on the underlying potential of these assets

278288 elliott gould donald sutherland and tom skerritt head an elliott gould star for an uptight age 2 more extremely effective low keyed cast of players
278289 in gould as the totally unmilitary but arrogantly competent supercool young battlefield surgeon a reluctant draftee whose credo is lets get the job done and knock off all this army muck the film finds its focus and its statement
278290 the performances are perfection and at the end you are left with a haunting image of the feiffer world where little daily murders done to mans soul have made feeling not merely dangerous but impossible
278291 theres been a shift in focus of movie heroes and movie stories out of this shift came the possibility of careers for the likes of gould alan arkin and dustin hoffman what really happened is that hollywood is trying to update its mythology and these are the stars of the new mythology
278292 one of cinemas wittiest and savviest deconstructions the long goodbye 1973 transposes chandler to the nam era and ends up an anti noir anthem with elliott gould as a beleaguered slovenly marlowe slumming around glitzy 70s l a
278293 s lick and often witty cop thriller with gould and blake in fine form as the vice squad detectives going it alone in the face of apathy and corruption among their superiors in their attempts to clean up la
278294 the aggressive and impudent half of the two friends who are the films focus
278295 george segal is the more buttoned down but despondent bill gould came closer than any other actor perhaps to in his loose uncontainable acting style embodying in physical form the qualities which help constitute the altman vision
278296 the films biggest asset is star elliott gould playing a character who cant find a segment of society in which he totally fits gould stands apart from others even when hes assimilating
278297 both gould and anderson give intense and candid performances and nykvists cinematography as ever is breathtaking
278298 offers one of the most civilized movie going experiences in the city
278299 a stomach churning gory often tasteless but frequently funny black comedy
278300 if as ex wife streisand once suggested gould was the american belmondo
278301 the long goodbye is the closest hollywood ever came to making its breathless seldom has artifice seemed more spontaneous
278302 altmans astonishing mise en sc ne contemplative of every level of interaction within a room a bar a place has rarely been put to more revelatory or personal ends its a masterpiece

278308 the second edition has been expanded and amended with an additional 36 new pages slotted in throughout the book
278309 other interesting information and previously unseen photographs had come to light since the first edition was printed which i wanted to include many of the original pages have been re jigged and updated with some photographs changed to facilitate this now the book has 160 pages in total
278310 finally the second edition has a hardback cover which has a slightly different layout to the first at the request of storm
278311 this is a great opportunity for us to show chinese readers what first class journalism we can deliver

278315 the commission the accc needs some additional powers to try and give independents a more level playing field
278316 unfortunately unless a new petrol commissioner is given new powers the petrol commissioner will become a punching bag in the same way as the previous one
278317 i kept hoping for the best so hearing its gone just kind of took the wind out of me
278318 it staggers the brain to think about how much devastation a fire can have how many people this affects
278319 the tugboat crew did a great job by calling the coast guard for assistance after activating the boats fire extinguishing system
278320 the call allowed the coast guard to act quickly to get the crew off the tug and the fire extinguished with no injuries or pollution to the environment

278323 it is an extremely exciting time in our nations history to be in washington i think we have the strongest portfolio of news programs and outlets in america
278324 it was a big change for me to leave the washington post co and go into television but journalism is journalism
278325 the big difference is the speed at which we do things in broadcast
278326 i cant think of anyone who is a better fit in that particular management position
278327 mark brings a certain sensitivity to that position where he will include diversity in his agenda as it relates to coverage out of that bureau
278328 for black viewers i think you are going to see a more level playing field in terms of assignments and coverage coming out of that office
278329 the way the industry looks now a black bureau chief is long overdue
278330 weve spent a lot of time talking about getting more points of view and people of different backgrounds on our broadcasts i think weve made real progress in the last year
278331 we will continue to work on it and i will do everything i can as bureau chief to further those goals and work with nbc news president steve capus to promote diversity on msnbc
278332 ben wont play for us while he remains in the current situation he rejected a new deal and wants to leave

278349 the site says of itself that although coming from different traditions
278350 it it also announced that it would seek to influence the 1998 and 2000 elections and included an advisory board of flynn spoke at the tenth anniversary celebration of priests for life and declared that catholics need to be told how to vote
278351 flynn believes that there is a catholic way to vote that catholics need to be told how to vote he has alligned himself with the most authoritarian and rightwing catholic religious and political leaders in the united states who would define their particular form of catholicism and the politics and policies that stem from it as normative for catholics and would impose them on all americans if they could
278352 there was never a compelling offer put on the table

278356 with investigators close to filing charges against him the scientist
278357 but he was clearly in great mental anguish in recent weeks maryland court documents show he had been under psychiatric treatment and had been served with a restraining order directing him to stay away from a woman he was accused of stalking and threatening and a lab colleague told the a p he was recently removed from his workplace by the police because of fears that he had become a danger to himself or others justice department agreed to pay 4 6 million to settle a lawsuit by another biodefense researcher at the same facility the settlement ended a five year legal battle over dr hatfills allegations that investigators violated his privacy by leaking information on the investigation to journalists department of justice emphatically denied any liability in connection with dr hatfills claims despite agreeing to settle with him and it was far from clear whether the suicide of dr ivins might bring an end to the anthrax case
278358 the los angeles times first reported the investigation of dr
278359 the 2001 anthrax mailings were baffling in several ways not least because the victims
278360 it was really the anthrax letters with the first one sent on september 18 just one week after 9 11 that severely ratcheted up the fear levels and created the climate that would dominate in this country for the next several years after
278361 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u
278362 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
278363 much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to islamic terrorists there was a specific intent indispensably aided by as their top news story that government tests conducted on the anthrax tests conducted at ft
278364 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
278365 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
278366 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
278367 that applies to much of the beltway class including many well connected journalists who were quietly popping cipro back then because like cohen they heard from government sources that they should
278368 in chicago an 80 year old cast iron water main broke earlier this year spilling thousands of gallons and opening up a 25 foot hole in the street
278369 cleveland has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on infrastructure in the past 20 years but still must repair daily breaks
278370 the amount of wasted water from these breaches is staggering
278371 water utilities largely managed by city governments have never faced improvements of this magnitude before
278372 another 464 vermont bridges are ranked functionally obsolete defined as a span that doesnt meet current criteria for lane width carrying capacity clearance or roadway approach alignment
278373 thats a problem that vermont shares with the rest of the nation
278374 revenue for the transportation fund in vermont is declining because vermonters are cutting back on their driving and buying less gasoline
278375 a crumbling public infrastructure combined with a lack of political will to spend the money it will take to rebuild and expand it will doom this state and this nation to second rate status

278379 i like jerry but i think a new ceo is needed
278380 it would have been nice if they announced other directors were leaving or announced the icahn nominees
278381 a good development but i dont think hes the full solution
278382 i might have to cut my losses i voted against the entire board
278383 i think jerry and david filo are to be congratulated for what theyve created but i dont think jerry is the guy for the day to day ceo role

278399 ich habe zeit und arbeitsaufwand hineingesteckt um dies zu einem ort zu machen in den sich die menschen verlieben k nnen genauso wie es mir ergangen ist
278400 jetzt wo wir beide allein sind brauchen wir nicht mehr all den platz den dieses haus bietet
278401 aber wir lieben diese gegend so sehr dass wir auf einem nahe gelegenen grundst ck ein kleineres haus gebaut haben einfach nur damit wir hier bleiben k nnen ich hoffe dass irgendjemand anderes jetzt dieses haus und das was es zu bieten hat sch tzen wird wundersch ne natur friedliche gr nfl chen und ein haus das man das ganze jahr ber geniessen kann

278418 communication is very important and useful in our lives if we dont communicate there is no understanding one another in your own family and everywhere you go it is good to have good communication it is very important to develop good communication in our society
278419 ive known that communication is an important part of life but until now no one has ever been able to tell anyone how to communicate
278420 i learned how to be calm when responding to a disaster
278421 we couldnt get access to her with the fire engines and used our helicopter
278422 this has been the busiest january ive had in 20 years
278423 will be able to live in the home for up to eight months with no mortgage payments
278424 your credit can be repaired and you will be able to purchase a house in as few as two years
278425 should never insure loans when the homeowner clearly does not have skin in the game
278426 theres just no way you can find anything here where that limit comes even close
278427 youd think that in a time of war when youre doing a stimulus bill and raising all the other loan limits you might remember the vets but that didnt happen
278428 it makes the va program irrelevant in a lot of places
278429 bolstered huds interpretation that if a real estate broker cannot produce evidence of the services it performed for the administrative or other add on fees it charges a violation may exist
278430 underscores the importance of performing actual services in exchange for
278431 for the increasing costs they incur to run their businesses
278432 if the sellers or buyers dont like that arrangement they can walk down the street to another broker
278433 contributed to the growing foreclosure crisis and turmoil in the housing market
278434 we have agreed to roll over and just do it
278435 servicers tell everybody call us as soon as you have problems making the monthly payment
278436 not the loss mitigation department where loan modifications and short sales are handled
278437 so i find myself telling clients look if they arent working with you maybe you shouldnt make any payments for a couple of months then theyll pay attention thats a ridiculous situation
278438 the collection folks are trained to recognize loss mitigation opportunities early
278439 things can drag on for months because the servicers fail to negotiate with you in good faith
278440 on a loan of 300 000 and with a credit score of 675 which is not a bad score and a 75 percent loan to value ratio 25 percent down payment the cost is an additional 2 250 per loan
278441 to get any sort of quote youre going to need to know your fico score in advance and before actually applying you may need to take some steps to raise your fico score
278442 but now weve got this whole new gray area between 620 and 680
278443 investors are just too afraid to take the risk anymore
278444 we see this every day now investor e mails telling us the minimum fico for certain loans we want to see is 700
278445 were beginning to see tightening in areas where delinquency rates are high
278446 remove the mortgage interest deduction on mcmansions homes over 3 000 square feet
278447 in order to address the issue of climate change we must address the issue of consumption
278448 we strongly support increasing energy efficiency in houses but basing taxation on square footage rather than actual energy usage doesnt make sense
278449 different people measuring square footage can come up with different numbers thats why mls multiple listing service listings usually say the square footage is approximate
278450 we believe a much better approach would be to look at consumer behavior how efficient are the appliances theyve installed how energy efficient are the windows insulation heating and air conditioning
278451 any proposal from chairman dingell very seriously because of his impressive record of legislative accomplishments
278452 we would have seen a nationwide drop in the rate of foreclosure filings
278453 weve got to use the most recent market data that is available to us
278454 if the appraisal comes in above the contract that tells you something unusual is happening out there
278455 it certainly puts us in an uncomfortable position when we find that the selling price is below market value
278456 we wonder whats going on out there are sellers giving in to the bottom feeders
278457 have to look not only at closed sales and current listings
278458 sheer size sprawl and commutes lead to dramatically more energy use or to put it more simply a larger carbon footprint
278459 the residential part of the climate change problem is very significant
278460 the mortgage interest deduction was meant to be an incentive for people to buy and afford a home but now we see it has significant energy impacts
278461 we think dingells idea is terrific the carbon tax would give important incentives to minimize energy consumption
278462 hedge funds high net worth individuals wall street investment banks and groups of doctors and lawyers
278463 we might offer 65 percent of a propertys expected value after repair now in some places were looking at 50 percent
278464 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead we are talking about attacks like the sub prime mortgage that was a phenomenon that started in the african american and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell and the jena six and on and on in the face of all these attacks why is it that you have not one time had the ability to speak to the interest and the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community in this country
278465 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together that i think has got to be our agenda
278466 thats not what so and so says this passage is about
278467 i like to think of it as wanted 1 5

278530 im not going to be surprised one day that franklin breaks that record the number of goals kicked in one game that will never surprise me
278531 it doesnt really come into my head if im kicking the goals and the points are still there and were winning ive got no problem with it to be honest
278532 id rather the ones from the boundary less pressure on me
278533 ive got my own natural kicking style theres not point changing it is there
278534 ive been doing my goal kicking from the start of pre season so ive just been sticking to what ive done nothings really changed at all with my goal kicking
278535 theres a lot of people out there who seem to be displeased with it his goal kicking but were pretty happy with the contribution that he makes
278536 maybe there might be an opportunity for the media to focus on the guys that cant get the footy rather than the guys who can get the footy then focus on the goal kicking

278554 we remain on schedule to deliver the first android based handset in the second half of 2008 and were very excited to see the momentum continuing to build behind the android platform among carriers handset manufacturers developers and consumers
278555 i think there are going to be many mobile phone platforms its not going to converge quickly

278558 the open web foundation differs from most formal standards bodies as it is based around individual membership like the apache software foundation and is designed to have a lightweight process which makes it easier for a community of individuals and or companies to come together and start work on an open specification
278559 like the apache software foundation the incubation process will also focus on building a diverse community of contributors to each specification as well as ensuring the existence of multiple interoperable implementations like the ietf does
278560 one thing i dont like about oscon is it feels a little bit too commercial for me

278577 we figure out how to use it in the enterprise
278578 these prices require two year contracts and are available to the following customers
278579 iphone customers who purchased before july 11 customers activating a new line with at amp t and current at amp t customers who are eligible at the time of purchase for an upgrade discount
278580 eligibility for the upgrade discount typically involves a number of factors including how long you have been in your current service agreement your payment history for example prompt payment of bills and more
278581 in general you are more likely to qualify if you are at or near the end of your current service agreement and pay your wireless bills promptly
278582 with so many players on both teams there has to be some cross fertilization going on and no doubt some discussions
278583 having an open source os that is adopted by a broad array of device manufacturers allows the manufacturers to better compete for additional business by allowing sales of games music videos apps and other services even on those devices not manufactured by their own company
278584 google is learning how hard it is to create a good mobile os
278585 the mobile market needs some level of consolidation of platforms if it is to make big leaps forward as app developers currently struggle to make their products available on so many platforms
278586 a combination of the android and symbian efforts would be good for the industry good for google and good for symbian
278587 it would also help spur growth in the availability of applications and services the downside is minimal everyone wins

278590 i dont think rogers will make any changes to their pricing plans
278591 this could be an opportunity for bell and telus which will be offering the blackberry bold sometime this summer
278592 lower your prices and then i will think about it but until then no thanks not a chance
278593 get a clue rogers this is outrageous when will canadians finally take a stand against rogers first high prices then no rollovers and now these outrageous iphone deals and a 3 year term get with it were far behind in the cell phone world far behind 3rd world countries
278594 has always been to squeeze as much profit as they can from early adopters before introducing any price drop
278595 rogers and other carriers will hold onto current price structures until new competitors enter the market and start offering lower prices
278596 rogers has the monopoly on the iphone here and is confident the iphones appeal will win over users
278597 most of our clients say they are likely to stick with their blackberries because their networks are heavily invested into these devices
278598 this is a fairly straightforward procedure that has been used in the blackberry and other cell phones
278599 this is the price we pay for fostering a monopolistic market weve seen this thing happen with the blackberry before and well see it with other devices until real competition comes around
278600 the phone can change its personality to become whatever is most suitable for the task at hand
278601 it will shed foreign material similar to how a freshly waxed car will repel water and allow it to roll off
278602 the nanosensors will continuously monitor different environmental things from air pollution to the bodys biochemical processes
278603 dialing picking up and hanging up the phone are voice activated
278604 beta release 8 is compatible with the final iphone os 2 0 release and must be used to build and sign any iphone os application to be submitted to the app store as a reminder you must be a member of the iphone developer program to submit apps
278605 we encourage developers to apply to the iphone developer program for access to additional support resources as well as access to a certificate that enables development directly on an iphone or ipod touch
278606 the outlook for the uk economy has worsened as 2008 has progressed and the degree of uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased there is a risk that the current economic and market turbulence could continue for a significant period of time and a risk of further uncertainty and contagion impacting the valuation of alliance amp leicester
278607 the proposal provided greater stability and greater certainty in uncertain times
278608 as with abbey in the early part of this century small banks lacking the skills set in capital markets are the ones being hurt most by credit events
278609 first half earnings at alliance amp leicester were almost completely wiped out by treasury losses as well as the expensive funding facility we fear this will mean a repeat performance at bradford amp bingley reporting on august 29
278610 the potential read across to bradford amp bingley particularly with respect to margins does not look good

278612 the increase in volume of iphone searches demonstrates just how heavy that interest has been for the next generation of apples popular phone even when its existence was still just a rumor
278613 mobile browsing was considered a second class citizen on the web
278614 you had to serve completely different content with a different markup language and different protocols
278615 theres now a convergence of the desktop web and the mobile device web
278616 the iphone really cracked that open and people are starting to think differently about the services on their device
278617 people browsing the web from a mobile device dont expect an alternative universe which lacks features theyre used to
278618 with the proliferation of smartphones throughout our business it poses a great risk if and when hackers get good at pumping malware through those devices
278619 the phone has advanced exponentially while users have not caught up and realized that they are walking around with a computer
278620 you can get cross site exploits that can dive down into the phones browser then its a problem
278621 anything that is network connected and can be altered is a potential threat says rob enderle principal analyst for enderle group a technology advisory firm in san jose
278622 most of the known viruses and trojans will propagate through bluetooth or multimedia messaging mms
278623 so all it takes is one person walking into a meeting with an infected device and the rest of the room now needs a dose of penicillin
278624 its really important in planning a mobile deployment of devices outside your firewall that you establish a mobile security strategy including application security
278625 you create an approved list of applications and the privileges they have when theyre running on the handset
278626 project crackberry is a research project which aims to study the impact of push mail technology e g via blackberry on productivity and work life balance of professionals
278627 i am a self declared crackberry crackberry is a nickname for the blackberry that was coined because of the devices addictive nature

278632 if he would have been 6 4 or 6 5 everybody in the country would have wanted him hes hands down the best offensive lineman ive coached in 39 years theyve got a jewel
278633 coach sherman coached offensive line in college and in the nfl so hes offensive lineman minded hes also put together a great coaching staff thats family oriented i loved the atmosphere over there
278634 my kid is better than your kid because youre a lousy parent
278635 we want to get these little scooters together have some rides and have some fun
278636 yes kinetic used to sell its luna mopeds and if one recollects it also sold a consignment of its pride scooterette but at that point in time the performance loving yankee soccer moms preferred the huge suvs and pick ups making these the wrong products at that time
278637 and he doesnt want to remind people how close the race was
278638 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
278639 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
278640 as the american army we have drivers cooks crewmen and legal personal
278641 we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
278642 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations
278643 so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees
278644 he was a driver and auto mechanic he was not at all a military man
278645 he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pick up trucks
278646 i was personally responsible for transporting and getting out all families from afghanistan to
278647 it is the responsibility of the people to vote the congress out of office for good we need action not talk
278648 we are giving our wealth to the middle east because we refuse to provide our own energy why because our congress represents the corporate state and not the people
278649 in fact every new promise that the new members of congress ran on to get elected remains exactly that an empty promise i have to laugh when i recall the self righteous finger waving of house speaker nancy pelosi and company now go on and enjoy your vacation you earned it
278650 we have all been wringing our hands about energy and our dependence on foreign oil for the past 30 years
278651 and we wonder why the public is cynical and the wrong track numbers are at an all time high
278652 members of congress and in this example i mean the majority have refused to take any action because it is easier to wait out the presidential election and then see what the climate is like because unfortunately for the people congress can choose to vote only when it is convenient to do so
278653 because there is nothing they can do for immediate energy prices and they have profound differences for the long term that are not easily reconcilable
278654 right now the publics anger at washington is mainly being taken out on the party of the president
278655 and its not likely that is going in change due to congresss failure to act during the august recess
278656 allowing offshore drilling will have no impact on gas prices its a drop in the bucket
278657 but the idea that this is a conspiracy by the big oil companies is wrong as well

278673 ive just got a feeling hes going to be a significantly better player not just because of the weight but because of the work ethic is one of the things i wanted him to get better at browning said
278674 im really excited about seeing him at 240 as opposed to 268 hell be able to play lower because of it and if he plays with great pad level he is a hard man to tackle he is a powerfun human being

278681 the commission the accc needs some additional powers to try and give independents a more level playing field
278682 unfortunately unless a new petrol commissioner is given new powers the petrol commissioner will become a punching bag in the same way as the previous one
278683 they got rid of rebecca they were getting rid of me
278684 in the hope that we may return him to australia so its just comes as a sad note that weve sent him back to a very violent environment and he is now shot dead
278685 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we were a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case
278686 this was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
278687 spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
278688 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
278689 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
278690 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
278691 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders
278692 at no point did this board or management in any way ever resist microsofts proposal
278693 we proactively engaged with them and tried to reach a positive conclusion for shareholders
278694 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
278695 if you have a bad breakup walk away and dont say anything
278696 this is an absolutely marvelous game that fills me with envy
278697 as a citizen of the united states and speaking for the us as a whole we do now officially disown and disavow the rpg net poster known as zenten he does not speak for us and his opinions in no way reflect the opinions or attitudes of the united states or its populance please do not refer to him as an american that is our word and he has no claim upon it
278698 im not really a femme fatale i was never an adulteress since i never got married
278699 the industry is encountering sales levels we havent seen in decades
278700 in the next several months maybe even years the unfolding credit situation facing customers will take center stage
278701 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
278702 thats why were accelerating production of four cylinder models and quickly responding to market conditions
278703 in its may 30 e mail notice to eimprovement a participating assurz retailer assurz citing a contract stipulation that lets it discontinue service with a three day notice said it would terminate its service as of june 2 because your refund rate has been consistently greater than fees we have received for the services leading to cumulative net losses from refund payouts by assurz
278704 as a creditor what you can do is file a proof of claim this is your legal statement that the business owes you money the administrator in charge of the chapter 11 case called a trustee will determine whether it is possible for you to be paid do it soon as there is a deadline for filing
278705 if the company is paying back all its obligations through the chapter 11 then you would get paid eventually if they are not paying back everyone then theres a line that forms secured creditors go first those who loaned the company start up capital for equipment or real estate then the government in case the company owes corporate and employment taxes then unsecured creditors such as yourself

278715 every time i hit the send button it saves me 42 cents times the 249 e mails on my list
278716 in scrapbooking there are new products coming out all the time to stay competitive i need to keep my customer base informed of new arrivals otherwise they might go elsewhere
278717 i cant believe the number of people who are actually walking into our restaurants and redeeming the coupons

278721 for some of my favorites most linux distributions come with a copy of openoffice
278722 first we would like to assure you that brother stands behind our product and the information disclosure that we provide to the consumer it is always our policy to provide such information to consumers to help them understand both the product and the conditions under which the product operates
278723 to address your specific question regarding ink volume the rated yield for each cartridge follows the industry standard of that period which was based on 5 page coverage
278724 importantly there is a technical and performance reason for why the small amount of ink is remaining in a cartridge that is identified as empty as mentioned in the user manual even though the machine informs you that an ink cartridge is empty there will be a small amount of ink remaining in the ink cartridge it is necessary to keep some ink in the ink cartridge to prevent air from drying out and damaging the print head assembly by doing so the machine is protected and consistent print quality is ensured to satisfy the consumer in effect remaining ink should not be viewed as waste but as brothers affirmative action to provide ongoing high quality output and performance of the machine
278725 its environmentally unfriendly the more frequently were required to change our ink cartridges unnecessarily the more landfill waste granted many people recycle their used cartridges but just as many throw them in the garbage
278726 change the name in your rant from brother to canon and its exactly the same story my brand new canon was telling me the color cartridge was dangerously low for months before i actually got a printout with some missing color
278727 ive been in the supplies industry for 30 years and 7 years ago developed my own web site officesupplyoutfitters com to sell aftermarket and compatible replacement alternatives why because inkjet and toner cartridges were appallingly high priced if that werent enough the printer manufacturers are now using new technology to get you to buy more than you need now some of the printer manufacturers are using chips on their cartridges to prevent aftermarket suppliers from being able to remanufacture their cartridges
278728 just have to add my 2 cents to this in addition to my raging fury with hp for installing mini ink cartridges in new printers that will print a test page and then force you to buy full sized ink cartridges right out of the gate the hp officejet pro k850 forces me to change practically full cartridges because it says they have expired this machine takes 4 high yield tanks of ink at about 80 to replace

278747 the answer is yes they see and notice racial differences from a very young age even in infancy
278748 for children under the age of seven race or rather physical traits like skin color language and hair texture are just signs that someone is in some way different from themselves similar to gender or weight its not unusual or unhealthy for kids to gravitate toward the familiar so early in life kids views only become prejudiced when they start linking these physical traits to flaws in character or behavior we adults are the ones who ascribe malice to simply noticing racial differences
278749 they assume that if they raise their children not to recognize racial differences theyll prevent them from becoming racist
278750 instead of trying to ignore race research suggests that parents should be more pro active

278869 pre modern islamic literature considered gender irrelevant to love and beauty alternatively male beauty and male homoeroticism were considered the superior sentiments
278870 the figure of young adolescent men as object of desire was linked with the practice of gazing
278871 by the end of the nineteenth century portrayal of beauty became differentiated by gender
278872 reading the female male couple not simply as an amorous couple but as a scene of multiple desires is grounded in iconic points the male figure in the male female amorous couple is always a very young man without a beard or mustache at most with a hint of newly emerging down that icon of young mans beauty he may be a nawkhatt but never an adult man the figures in these paintings have a strong outward gaze which may be inviting the viewer to be an accomplice in the pleasures of the visual text to become actively engaged in the production and circulation of desire inside and outside of the visual text
278873 the anger at european readings of iranian social and sexual mores began to reconfigure structures of desires by introducing a demarcation to distinguish homesociality from homesexuality
278874 condensed double meanings if shah king and holy man jamshid and ali
278875 the gendered construction of modernity whereby the homeland was a female body the military masculine was the protector of the female homeland
278876 argues that binarization of gender and the heteronormalization of love and sexuality should also be seen as the work of nationalism and patriotism
278877 iran as a female beloved in turn consolidated love as heteroeros
278878 vatan meant national homeland but its emotive force still depended on ones affiliation with and affection for the land of ones birth the sentiment associated with the known tangible soil of ones birthplace was transferred to the larger more mediated iranzamin
278879 in him ibid both the factions blamed the prevalence of homosexuality and pederasty on gender segregation and female homosociality 147
278880 acquired through modern education as an internal quality of the self
278881 contest notions of citizenship through schools the press and the courts
278882 from its inception iranian feminism has been deeply enmeshed in disavowal denial and eradication of male homo eroticism
278883 what if instead of disavowing male homosexuality and same sex affectivity feminism would being to inquire into the kinds of affinity
278884 it will certainly cause cracked plaster and broken windows but probably not structural damage

278898 when someone pulls out those cotton balls from a medicine bottle its the creepiest thing
278899 i like that josh is not a typical punk rock drummer
278900 its a 12 song concept album were going to go back and do some pre production work edit the songs and make them more powerful each song is an effort to communicate particular emotions and feelings even though its a militaristic setting its not about political activism its really about forgiveness its about two friends
278901 i think its a story everyone can relate to because it holds basic moral values that are universal like turning the other cheek
278902 play florida shows go out of town and build a fan base after that we hope we can open for a national act and do an east coast tour

278905 i just said whatever beef we had lets just end it now and focus on the band ever since then adam and i have become really close friends
278906 i write with ebbs and flows and polyphonic sounds together and that goes for everybody
278907 the basic idea that we have as a band is to take the listener on an emotional roller coaster not just write about girlfriend problems but to have this seamless album from start to finish and really have it communicate to them
278908 the forbes report is further proof that california has a hostile business climate that forces companies to shift jobs to other states because government regulations have made it too expensive to do business here its clear that the legislature must act now to pass the economic reforms proposed by republicans to jump start our economy and encourage more job creation which will bring more revenue to our state increasing taxes on businesses will further hurt our economy and lead to more job losses
278909 the governors action today underscores the severity of the states fiscal situation the reality highlighted by the governors action is that californias budget process must be reformed it is the only way to avoid these types of drastic measures in the future republicans are working to pass a responsible budget one that will reform our system without hurting taxpayers or the economy
278910 todays action is truly unfortunate republicans take our budget responsibility very seriously and are committed to reaching a budget agreement as soon as possible so state workers are fully paid for their service to california we are continuing to advocate for a responsible balanced budget that gets spending under control improves our economy and protects taxpayers republicans are also fighting to reform our broken budget system to avoid such drastic measures in the future

278932 can there be any greater shame for the prime minister and the congress leadership but the worrying thing is that there is no sense of remorse or guilt at these immoral and shady practices such is the degeneration of the congress party in its lust to remain in office

278937 the land was first transferred and then suddenly taken back to appease the hardliners
278938 the bjp has used the agitation to communalise the situation whereas congress was trying to consolidate its 2002 gains here

278943 sechs wochen vorbereitung so was gab es damals noch nicht und bei uns fing die saison erst ende august an
278944 da war nur etwa die h lfte der ersten mannschaft dabei der rest von uns weilte ja eben noch in urlaub statt dessen haben da einfach viele jungs aus der umgebung mittrainiert die wollten alle mal ins fernsehen
278945 mit zustimmung der hochzeitsgesellschaft konnten wir dort den beitrag sehen die haben sich wirklich mit uns gefreut und daf r ihre feierlichkeiten sogar ein wenig unterbrochen

278954 if it wasnt for him she wouldnt have made it thats why we wanted to thank him
278955 i am very happy were here today because i believe these men deserve their right to justice and theyve spent a lot of years waiting
278956 the bottom line is as we sit here today the individual that sexually assaulted mrs wilson is not in prison
278957 it does nobody any good to have innocent people locked up and perpetrators walking free
278958 just because the dna result came in it doesnt necessarily exonerate the defendants of all criminal wrongdoing
278959 he didnt want to feel bitter or hateful to anyone involved in the case and he felt really sad for the wilson family because they havent been given justice
278960 theyre not innocent by any means no way are they innocent

278969 i am not in the best shape i am not at my highest level so it will take time for me to get better
278970 i want to be healthy i want to improve i want to play tennis i dont really think about no 1 or whatever happens if its going to happen it will happen
278971 to make my opponents all tired and then just beat them
278972 it will take time for me to make that better because at the moment im struggling to play at a high level for two sets
278973 if i was playing three sets i dont know they would probably have to take me out in an ambulance
278974 im starting to believe that i can beat the best players in the world im not giving them as much respect
278975 having so many tournaments in a row that are very important is quite difficult
278976 its the same for me and for all of the players as you can see there are a lot of injuries a lot of top players who are not really at their best its hard but we have to deal with it
278977 it could be possible because this is the first time i beat the no 2 in the world
278978 im really getting confidence i think also the big players will start to respect me
278979 this is very much making us little more than a reseller
278980 it seems like a way to limit our growth so this wont happen
278981 it seems like hes this weird kind of pack rat

278985 i went oooh that looks like my bike i found my baby
278986 everyone there leaves their bikes unlocked i think we should be able to be like that
278987 it was one of those happy sad moments it was all rusted out and not treated properly it wasnt worth taking home but it was a sense of closure
278988 a lot of people instead of calling and saying thats my bicycle would just pay igor 30 and take their bike back
278989 we were in plainclothes that afternoon just on our way to another bike bait location
278990 these guys had to empty the garages and in this heat and they took them all over to the police garage on hanna and they ran out of room so they had to put them all in the truck and bring them over here when i got back on shift they said you better watch your car rowe im gonna owe those guys some cold drinks at some point
278991 we cant hang horse thieves anymore so we want to see how the process works
278992 now that igors in jail you see all the crackheads circling around igors shop and scurrying away everyone used to see his truck driving around full of bikes
278993 we knocked three homicides off the front page because everyone can relate to having their bike stolen

279003 in my opinion it would be more wiser of brad amp angelina to use other means of raising money for their foundation than using their innocent kids that arent old enough to have any say in the matter cuz the end results security wise of them putting their kids on display like that could have very diverse effects on them someday
279004 in prior news articles they were telling people that they are going to get 11 million and now it is 14 mil cant they make up their fricken minds as to what the true amount is next week they might be telling everybody that it will be 20 million then the next week 25 million bucks or more what the hell is wrong with them people

279026 when borja fernandez bought his two bedroom apartment in madrid in 2005 it was valued at 530 000 euros even though he only paid 486 000 euros that allowed caja madrid to overstate the amount of home equity backing his 450 000 euro mortgage

279036 dave retter designated broker and co owner of windermere tri cities in kennewick thinks the market will have a strong second half of the year every year youre not going to set a record in a good market retter said
279037 i know that folks in the housing business are going through some tough times but im not willing as a card carrying member of said media to take responsibility for it we didnt invent the housing bubble or the mortgage crisis or the resulting economic recession and while we do write a lot about it perhaps lengthening the trough we also helped hype the market when it was on the way up
279038 remember how buyers needed to hurry needed to pay more than listing how it was ok to borrow more than you could afford because appreciation would take care of it where were the complaints about those stories
279039 people have stopped braying on about how much their property is worth and what they are going to do when all the lovely lucre from it is realised no one is banging on about doing up rambling farmhouses in france or fincas in spain no one gives a floating shelf what sarah beeny or kirstie allsopp thinks this week
279040 while dreams of making pots of money from our houses which would enable us to run off into the sunset in pursuit of the remote worker yoga teacher perfect downsized dream are being shattered by falling property prices this economic standstill could prompt a new appreciation for the houses we are stuck with
279041 but it is a relief that nomadism among the professional classes and better yet talking about it is being forced to stop we might get to know each other and our homes a bit better

279045 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
279046 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
279047 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
279048 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
279049 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
279050 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
279051 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
279052 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
279053 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
279054 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
279055 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
279056 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
279057 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
279058 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue
279059 realistically that track did something that weve never seen it do before and thats not take rubber
279060 that is somehow different from what we experienced in 06 and 07
279061 the whole combination of that tire the car of tomorrow on that racetrack caused that right rear tire to wear like we had never seen before the fronts were similar to what we had seen in 06 and 07 the wear improved on the front but the rear never got any better
279062 weve got a lot of resources working on this weve done a lot of modeling weve got our top chemists working at that we need to decide obviously what we need to do as a tire company to manufacture a tire thats going to work on this car on that racetrack
279063 when they asked me to do the third one i was grounded in the subject as a film viewer
279064 if the mummy movies have a theme it is the quest for life after death and the idea in western culture that if you meddle with that the natural processes bad things are going to happen
279065 i consider it sort of the off page form of christianity the dark side of the idea that only through me will you gain eternal life
279066 you know you had in the roles the two great horror actors ever boris karloff and lon chaney most people if they have seen one have seen the karloff version for me i saw these movies when i was 10 these movies make you both fascinated and fearful of this place called egypt
279067 i thought it was so funny as a kid all of the jokes that those two guys could generate around a genre that at that point had a lot of mummy movies
279068 i like what stephen sommers did in the first one it had kind of a campy treatment but a modern visual effects treatment a guy in ragged bandages limping around in the dark looking for his tanis leaves suddenly became a wide scale visual effects spectacle i liked that jump
279069 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
279070 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
279071 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
279072 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
279073 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
279074 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
279075 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
279076 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
279077 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
279078 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
279079 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
279080 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
279081 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
279082 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
279083 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
279084 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
279085 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
279086 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
279087 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
279088 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
279089 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
279090 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
279091 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
279092 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
279093 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
279094 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
279095 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

279097 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
279098 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
279099 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
279100 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
279101 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
279102 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
279103 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
279104 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
279105 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
279106 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
279107 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
279108 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
279109 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
279110 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
279111 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
279112 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
279113 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
279114 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
279115 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
279116 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
279117 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
279118 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
279119 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
279120 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
279121 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
279122 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
279123 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
279124 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
279125 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
279126 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
279127 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
279128 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
279129 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling

279179 i think that the major difference that everyone has noted compared to other wto meetings is that china has been included in the main core of the negotiations
279180 this is an important change because china is a very specific country that doesnt really need this deal to improve its trade balance or to benefit more from trade
279181 china has been under a lot of pressure from the u s to become more engaged in these negotiations

279200 he had a great game against us a few years ago the u s a and was real brash about it
279201 i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
279202 i think it started with dwight early in the game he got it going on the defensive end which led over to the offensive end once he holds it down in the middle like that we feed off of that
279203 kobe locked him up he got a couple of open shots throughout the course of the game but when kobe was on him i dont think he scored
279204 i think he was actually a little tentative to shoot the ball when kobe was on him

279234 our study suggests that demyelinated tissues produce signals that can enhance the generation of new neurons in damaged areas of the brain based on our findings there is enough evidence to support the idea that new neurons can re grow in multiple sclerosis lesions
279235 the basic science discovery may provide the basis for the development for new therapies for ms and other neurodegenerative diseases
279236 our findings raise the possibility that the physical symptoms of depression are particularly toxic to the cardiovascular system
279237 identifying the most harmful aspect of depression is important because we will then know which specific components to target with our treatments
279238 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis
279239 in addition we broke depression down into physical and cognitive emotion symptom clusters which is uncommon
279240 no secondary prevention trial has successfully reduced cardiovascular risk by targeting depression
279241 there currently exists no evidence that treating depression will help prevent heart disease
279242 the biggest reason is that studies that would be needed to draw that conclusion would have to be large and therefore very expensive
279243 hopefully an added bonus will be to reduce the risk of developing or suffering from heart disease
279244 businesses and corporations are seen as greedy selfish and evil business needs to become holistic and integral with deeper more comprehensive purposes if business owners entrepreneurs begin to manage their business more consciously for the well being of all their major stakeholders while fulfilling their highest business purpose then i believe that we would begin to see the hostility towards capitalism and business disappear

279301 none of us would ever wish the evil that was done on september the 11th yet after america was attacked it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror and saw our better selves we were reminded that we are citizens with obligations to each other to our country and to history we began to think less of the goods we can accumulate and more about the good we can do
279302 our nation this generation will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future we will rally the world to this cause by our efforts by our courage we will not tire we will not falter and we will not fail

279314 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
279315 gay activists push sexuality issues so intensively and blame us for talking about them too much
279316 there is no evidence at all to suggest that starting sex education at the age of four is going to reduce sexually transmitted infection and abortion rates among teenagers
279317 we have had 30 years of sex education in secondary schools and it has never been more easy for teenagers to get hold of contraception without their parents knowing yet both abortion rates and sexually transmitted infection rates have continued to rise
279318 i do not believe that it is the business to teach four years old those things which should only be taught by their parents
279319 there is enough state intervention already the parents should be able to control the pace of revelation
279320 i recommend progress and priorities as required reading for all who plan local delivery of sexual health services the actions advocated in this report will drive further improvements
279321 since the national strategy for sexual health and hiv was published seven years ago we have seen considerable action and funding from the department of health to improve services however the nhs is a very different place with a very different structure to what it was in 2001
279322 we must have leadership and commitment to sexual health at a local level if this doesnt happen we are in danger of slipping back into the dark days when gum clinics were to be found in portakabins and sexual health services were an afterthought when decisions were taken around planning service provision
279323 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
279324 gay activists push sexuality issues so intensively and blame us for talking about them too much
279325 alienates anglicans from the orthodox church and contributes to further division of the christian world
279326 such a practice contradicts centuries old church traditions dating back to the first christian community orthodox christians consider women bishops to be even more unacceptable

279335 eventually our plans are for the achievement system to become an account based system
279336 for now the points are just a wow character score as we graduate to that blizzard account system which is right on the horizon it will switch over to a blizzard level
279337 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing
279338 things like i have a horde and alliance character at maximum level or i have three max level characters
279339 for wow itll let us do a lot of really cool achievements and we can start doing those once achievements exist at the account level my system information
279340 we dont know why it got lost but once it did it chose to strand because it was sick
279341 i went quite far im sorry i didnt go farther but you know what can you do america has spoken no canadians were allowed to vote
279342 i wish canadians wouldve been able to vote because i have a lot of support here it couldve helped me out quite a bit but you know thats the rule
279343 voting is open to all persons located in the 50 united states the district of columbia and puerto rico
279344 in the end its been a really great thing and ive met a lot of amazing people
279345 i think its brought my comedy to a lot more people and hopefully ill be able to capitalize on that in america
279346 thats only in canada that people would kind of question if its fair that im involved
279347 its the only place anybody ever asked me why are you doing this arent you already doing well and im like well doing well in canada as a performer monetarily its not enormously lucrative and its a small market
279348 while this only impacts a small number of students we are deeply disappointed that the state department believes that flight training programs no longer further the public diplomacy mission of the united states this country has long been a world leader in flight training and we want to see that continue

279356 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
279357 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out
279358 ipod touch at least with the itouch you dont have the problem of listening to a song then worrying that if a call comes the device will freeze then you may end up missing your call
279359 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
279360 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
279361 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
279362 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
279363 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
279364 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue
279365 realistically that track did something that weve never seen it do before and thats not take rubber
279366 that is somehow different from what we experienced in 06 and 07
279367 the whole combination of that tire the car of tomorrow on that racetrack caused that right rear tire to wear like we had never seen before the fronts were similar to what we had seen in 06 and 07 the wear improved on the front but the rear never got any better
279368 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
279369 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
279370 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
279371 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
279372 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
279373 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue

279375 that is somehow different from what we experienced in 06 and 07
279376 the whole combination of that tire the car of tomorrow on that racetrack caused that right rear tire to wear like we had never seen before the fronts were similar to what we had seen in 06 and 07 the wear improved on the front but the rear never got any better
279377 weve got a lot of resources working on this weve done a lot of modeling weve got our top chemists working at that we need to decide obviously what we need to do as a tire company to manufacture a tire thats going to work on this car on that racetrack

279380 going back over my history has been like crawling over broken glass in the dark
279381 i hit women scared children assaulted strangers and chronically lied and gamed to stay high
279382 it is one thing to talk about how back in the day you were a narcissistic abusive loser it is another to show up two decades later in apparent sound mind and body and proceed to engage in reporting on your own life a vainglorious endeavor that is presumptuous in the extreme fact checking what i remembered is a fine idea in the abstract but as a practical matter it made me feel like a golem of my own abasement

279388 yesterday along with richard durbin a democratic leader in the senate i introduced a bill to reform the fda and give them more authority to address food safety
279389 we are temporary stewards of this unique national treasure the largest fresh water system in the world
279390 senate passage of this compact will help us protect the great lakes from water diversions and preserve this invaluable resource for future generations sensible conservation goals in water use will ensure that our children and great grandchildren benefit from the great lakes as we do
279391 todays passage is incredible news because the great lakes are not only an indispensable natural economic and recreation resource for ohio and many other states they are one of our nations greatest natural resources
279392 the best way we can preserve and protect them is by passing and enacting the great lakes compact and keeping control of the lakes in the hands of the states that surround them and value them the most
279393 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
279394 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
279395 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
279396 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

279400 we wanted a language that would be best suited to on demand development and deployment in effect we wanted all the flexibility of a dynamic language during the development process in the cloud that requires no compilation or linking or p code translation for any incremental code edits and testing etc but then all the power and performance of a intricately instrumented hand crafted 3gl language like c c and java that can reduce down to a compiled highly optimized format during the deployment stage it would be very difficult to achieve both attributes simultaneously with a traditional language offering where the emphasis is on one or the other dynamic interpreted vs compiled highly optimized

279481 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
279482 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
279483 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
279484 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
279485 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
279486 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
279487 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
279488 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
279489 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
279490 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
279491 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
279492 the state should lead by example and move away from our dependence on coal at the state owned heating plants in madison
279493 the state should seriously explore the possibility of eliminating coal at the plants considered in this study and move to technologies and fuels that will provide a cleaner energy future for the capitol city
279494 the public overwhelmingly encouraged the state to stop using coal as a fuel source and gave strong support for investment in and use of renewable energy sources
279495 drug addled anne hathaway chops off her hair for a wedding
279496 indeed we will go on making offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring libations to her do you think that we made cakes
279497 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
279498 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
279499 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
279500 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
279501 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
279502 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
279503 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
279504 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
279505 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
279506 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
279507 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
279508 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
279509 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
279510 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
279511 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
279512 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
279513 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
279514 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
279515 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
279516 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
279517 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
279518 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
279519 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
279520 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
279521 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
279522 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
279523 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
279524 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
279525 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
279526 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
279527 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
279528 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
279529 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
279530 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
279531 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
279532 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
279533 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
279534 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
279535 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
279536 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
279537 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
279538 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
279539 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
279540 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
279541 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
279542 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
279543 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
279544 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
279545 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
279546 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
279547 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
279548 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
279549 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
279550 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
279551 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
279552 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
279553 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
279554 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
279555 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
279556 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
279557 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
279558 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
279559 he just said we need to do all these things
279560 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward
279561 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
279562 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
279563 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
279564 integrated into a mainstream investment process in a way that enhances profitability
279565 an inconvenient truth the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do about it
279566 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
279567 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
279568 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
279569 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
279570 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
279571 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
279572 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
279573 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
279574 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
279575 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
279576 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
279577 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
279578 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
279579 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
279580 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
279581 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
279582 the voters we need to get are people not a whole lot unlike obama
279583 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
279584 are you better off now than you were four years ago
279585 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
279586 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
279587 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
279588 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
279589 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
279590 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
279591 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
279592 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
279593 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
279594 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
279595 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
279596 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
279597 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
279598 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
279599 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
279600 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
279601 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
279602 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
279603 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
279604 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
279605 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
279606 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
279607 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
279608 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
279609 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
279610 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
279611 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
279612 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
279613 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
279614 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
279615 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
279616 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
279617 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
279618 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
279619 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
279620 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
279621 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
279622 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
279623 there is not much that evangelicals have in common with the policies promoted by barack obama
279624 despite his best efforts to court people of faith voters understand the difference between lip service and public service and john mccains record is much more in line with the values of the evangelical community
279625 one thing that it clearly is indicative of this poll is that this nation cares about the christian values and ethics of a candidate for national office and it makes enough difference that the news media reports on it
279626 people of faith have always been involved in the political process they have a patriotic and scriptural obligation to do so it is to be ignored at the candidates peril
279627 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
279628 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
279629 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life
279630 the survival of the united states of america as we know it
279631 the tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately without taking the others into account
279632 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three
279633 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures that are needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
279634 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
279635 and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
279636 the quickest cheapest most efficient and best way to start using all of this renewable energy is in the production of electricity
279637 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
279638 it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
279639 get us off oil make us energy independent invest in clean energy and create a new generation of high quality green collar jobs
279640 one more rustbowl outpost that crawled out of the wrong side of the 1980s
279641 our families cant stand 10 more years of gasoline price increases
279642 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
279643 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
279644 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
279645 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
279646 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
279647 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
279648 hes got the emmy the oscar hes a nobel laureate why would he want to go back to that
279649 her favorite scene is me running naked covered in blood down a corridor with a chain saw in my hand she doesnt really understand why everyone found it so controversial
279650 i dont know an actor just tries to figure out a role
279651 i think too much is put into saving celebrities and we need do more about saving animals we need rehab for animals
279652 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
279653 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
279654 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
279655 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
279656 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
279657 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
279658 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
279659 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
279660 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
279661 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
279662 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
279663 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
279664 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
279665 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
279666 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
279667 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
279668 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
279669 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
279670 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
279671 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
279672 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
279673 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
279674 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
279675 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
279676 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
279677 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
279678 the arctic ocean is warming up icebergs are growing scarcer in some places and the seals are finding the water too hot
279679 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
279680 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
279681 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
279682 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
279683 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
279684 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
279685 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
279686 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
279687 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
279688 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
279689 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
279690 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
279691 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
279692 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
279693 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
279694 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
279695 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
279696 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
279697 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
279698 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
279699 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
279700 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
279701 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
279702 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
279703 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
279704 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
279705 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
279706 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
279707 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
279708 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
279709 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
279710 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
279711 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
279712 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
279713 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
279714 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
279715 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
279716 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
279717 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
279718 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
279719 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
279720 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
279721 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
279722 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
279723 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
279724 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
279725 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
279726 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
279727 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
279728 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
279729 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
279730 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
279731 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
279732 even coal has a role to play if the carbon dioxide is captured and safely buried but clean coal does not exist right now
279733 but we cannot do the job with renewable and efficiency alone
279734 an expanded role for nuclear energy as well as natural gas and clean coal with carbon capture and storage
279735 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
279736 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
279737 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
279738 climate change and energy security are not just threats they are opportunities
279739 we need to change the debate in this country from what we cant do to what we can do
279740 a new political environment in this country that will allow the next president to do what i think the next president is going to think is the right thing to do
279741 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
279742 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
279743 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
279744 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
279745 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
279746 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
279747 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
279748 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
279749 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
279750 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
279751 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
279752 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
279753 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
279754 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
279755 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
279756 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
279757 i am a doctor and am seven months pregnant with my first baby girl my iron levels have always been low i take iron supplements already but this product has helped my body to carry out its job of absorbing iron and im not so tired or run down i applaud you for a natural product that supports the body systemically from the inside out without serious side effects just wonderful
279758 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
279759 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
279760 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
279761 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
279762 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
279763 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
279764 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
279765 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
279766 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
279767 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
279768 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
279769 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
279770 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
279771 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
279772 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
279773 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
279774 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
279775 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
279776 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
279777 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
279778 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
279779 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
279780 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
279781 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
279782 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
279783 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
279784 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
279785 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
279786 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
279787 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
279788 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
279789 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
279790 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
279791 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
279792 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
279793 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
279794 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
279795 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
279796 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
279797 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
279798 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
279799 e quant cazz frisc e quant cazz bon lucas in one tree hill
279800 cavolo di tanti modi in cui morire perch hanno scelto di farla morire proprio cos
279801 come le galline a cui una volta mozzata la testa continuano vivere finch non muoiono dissanguate lo stesso non dovrebbe accadere per paris tanto il cervello non mica un organo vitale per lei
279802 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
279803 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used
279804 pawlenty is john mccains choice and that the announcement is coming very soon
279805 i stopped talking about the vice presidential issue for all the reasons we talked about last week and earlier today but i really appreciate you asking
279806 reelected in one of the toughest reelection years in the history of the republican party his father i am pretty sure drove a truck he has been pretty successfully able to work across the aisle in minnesota with the democrats
279807 no ones called me and i would have expected i would be called said steve andrews a tallahassee lawyer who was hired to dig into crists background by a group supporting his opponent in the 2006 governors race
279808 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative
279809 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
279810 the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect
279811 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
279812 and he has anointed himself ready to carry the burden of the one
279813 shes got it all and is a remarkable leader who brings a number of good qualities to the table
279814 im happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes
279815 in fact im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down
279816 like a dress on a beautiful woman long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest like my colleague jujus
279817 this kind of remark has no place in any setting and martin knows that and is truly sorry for his serious error in judgment
279818 if theres a can of whoop ass out here i open it
279819 if melinda had any information nancy grace stopped the investigation in its track
279820 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
279821 im disappointed that sen obama would say the things hes saying
279822 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
279823 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
279824 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
279825 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
279826 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
279827 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
279828 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
279829 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
279830 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
279831 while big oil is making record profits you are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
279832 4 billion each year to the oil companies including 1 2 billion for exxon mobil alone
279833 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
279834 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
279835 theres a lot of controversies that i have eagerly leapt into in my time im not so dumb that im going to jump into that one
279836 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
279837 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
279838 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
279839 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
279840 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
279841 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
279842 you know its not about you its about your country
279843 we have a really aggressive delivery program with this mrap
279844 and we found it was taking lots of time to locate the vehicles in the various processes it was very discouraging to us and we were using labor to accomplish this
279845 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
279846 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
279847 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
279848 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
279849 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
279850 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
279851 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
279852 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone
279853 we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
279854 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
279855 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
279856 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
279857 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
279858 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
279859 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
279860 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
279861 former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
279862 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
279863 the vice presidents main effort is to mobilize the american people behind meaningful action and less talk about global warming
279864 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
279865 none of us can walk away from this issue without agreeing with him that we do have a very serious problem and its only going to get worse unless we do something about it i hope to be a part of that and i would like to see the free market take the lead not the government
279866 it pointed out that the only way we have a chance to drive down oil prices is if we become free of the slavery of oil if we can give americans choices of electrical cars or biodiesel cars then and only then do we have a chance of dealing with this cost issue that is why 4 a gallon gas is not an enemy of action its an ally of action
279867 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
279868 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
279869 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
279870 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
279871 things are starting to green up a little bit but again once that moisture is gone out of the system in a week or two it will get very dry again
279872 yeah it was kind of scary to learn that i might not get the money i was looking forward to
279873 i couldnt focus on my studies i couldnt go to school during the day because i had to work
279874 so i was going to night school relying on summer school it really wasnt working
279875 basically you choose another lender you fill out another promissory note
279876 so its an extra step that you wouldnt have had to do
279877 some students may find when theyve been eligible before theyre no longer eligible for alternative loans
279878 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault
279879 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people they will delight our readers who have followed the growth of the jolie pitt family
279880 sooners won big 12 but came up short in fiesta bowl theyre looking for bigger and better things behind qb sam bradford who led the nation in passing efficiency rbs demarco murray and chris brown wr juaquin iglesias ol duke robinson dls gerald mccoy and demarcus granger and db nic harris
279881 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
279882 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
279883 que o terreno onde a escola foi constru da n o apresenta capacidade de suporte para a estrutura
279884 we know for instance that the public has said that if there is an upgraded video system they will feel safer and the perception of safety is very big
279885 he needs my support he needs me to help him live because the rest of you would allow him to waste away like some old fool
279886 he is blind not dead i will not allow him or anyone else to think otherwise
279887 all the word really means is that its been woven on a shuttle loom
279888 but the inference is higher quality because the yield is so horrible and the production method so slow it wouldnt make sense to use crap materials
279889 men are more savvy now than ever and theyre interested in the details and quality
279890 ainda sonho com o jogo s vezes nem consigo acreditar no que aconteceu a primeira vez que convivo com essa situa o e estou muito feliz
279891 ainda n o sei como vai ser mas isso comum na vida de todo jogador de futebol tenho que me acostumar
279892 tenho muita coisa para aprender e nem penso nisso ser titular tenho que subir cada degrau devagar trabalhando e procurando sempre ajudar quando for chamado
279893 temos que come ar o jogo com muita for a mas preciso jogar de maneira equilibrada e inteligente
279894 todo mundo aqui tem um nome a zelar a situa o n o confort vel mas cada um tem que dar o seu melhor para conquistar a confian a da torcida de novo
279895 quem est em campo n o pintado n o jogador nem presidente o n utico por isso treinamos aqui aqui a nossa casa e esperamos que a torcida venha incentivar
279896 okay now were getting into the somewhat serious stuff now
279897 i am prepared to stay here as long as we can
279898 when we come back in september were very hopeful they will allow this bill to come forward
279899 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
279900 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
279901 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
279902 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
279903 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
279904 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue
279905 realistically that track did something that weve never seen it do before and thats not take rubber
279906 that is somehow different from what we experienced in 06 and 07
279907 the whole combination of that tire the car of tomorrow on that racetrack caused that right rear tire to wear like we had never seen before the fronts were similar to what we had seen in 06 and 07 the wear improved on the front but the rear never got any better
279908 am ende haben wir aber ein ergebnis erzielt das mit sicherheit nicht alle erwartungen der kollegen erf llt das aber auch f r ver di vertretbar ist
279909 many of these commitments have been violated repeatedly and blatantly
279910 the recent dialogue between the chinese government and representatives of the dalai lama did not result in any progress
279911 thousands of peaceful tibetans still languish in prisons in the aftermath of protests that began in march chinese authorities stepped up their so called patriotic education campaigns that require tibetan buddhists regardless of their true thoughts beliefs and convictions to publicly denounce the dalai lama
279912 on july 30 the u s house of representatives considered a resolution calling on the chinese government to end abuses of human rights cease its repression of tibetan and uighur citizens and end its support for the governments of sudan and burma
279913 the resolution also calls on the president to make strong statements on human rights and meet with the families of jailed prisoners of conscience while in beijing it passed by a vote of 419 1
279914 your recent meetings with chinese dissidents at the white house are to be commended however your participation at the opening ceremony of the olympics will send a signal to the chinese people and the international community that could be misperceived as your approval and that of the american people for the draconian policies of the chinese government
279915 therefore it is essential that you unambiguously speak out for human rights and meet with the families of jailed prisoners of conscience while you are in beijing
279916 unser geheimdienst isi ist sehr kompetent g be es da sympathisanten wir w rden das nicht zulassen weil der dienst direkt dem premierminister untergeordnet ist
279917 oh wow well there goes another crazy feeding their own agenda off of the terrorism scare were all under

279919 tim russert whom we really coulda used for at least one more election year shortly after another big blow to me personally paul newmans still with us after his recent health scare
279920 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me
279921 if god is for than who can be against us
279922 keep your feet on the ground and jeep reaching for the stars
279923 devo uscire con uno e lui vuole trombare ma io non so come si fa aiutoooo
279924 la mia migliore amica mi ha sempre trattato male e sparlava di me con tutti poi alla fine mi ha rubato il ragazzo ho fatto bene a tagliare i ponti con lei
279925 oggi a pranzo ho mangiato questo questo e quellaltro ho mangiato troppo
279926 i dont really give a flying fuck if you tell me your number or not
279927 just go the fuck away and get the fuck out
279928 look at me because im pretty was once popular and therefore feel i dont have to abide by the rules
279929 can you you know like write down how many essays i have to do
279930 uhh high school was so much easier i just need like everything written down for me so i can like do it
279931 the absurdity here is that while carter complained about declining production it was american policies that forced that decline just as it does today ronald reagan relaxed restrictions and tax penalties on production and the energy crisis abated today we have at least six saudi arabias in oil shale alone let alone what we can get from anwr and the ocs and just like in the carter era the democrats wont let us get it
279932 el apoyo de petrocaribe para mejorar la plataforma de generaci n de energ a el ctrica en la regi n va desde la construcci n y financiamiento de nuevas plantas hasta el alquiler de grupos electr genos a partir de las solicitudes realizadas por cada pa s
279933 los proyectos de infraestructura desarrollados en el sector el ctrico permitieron reducir las interrupciones del suministro de electricidad en nicaragua al aportar alrededor de 30 de la demanda
279934 si llegan a tiempo estas plantas cuyo n mero no han precisado no habr riesgos de racionamiento de energ a el ctrica

279938 la vita come una scatola di cioccolatini non sai mai quello che ti capita
279939 that whole pc first thing you have to go back in id history to see why id initially developed for the pc
279940 wolfenstein 3d there was a nintendo version of that that was like a black day in id history how they made us change it to run on the nintendo platform
279941 wouldn t let you publish games on the console we didn t want to have our content governed by a third party
279942 but that dynamic isn t really like there anymore there are lots of games that have content whether its language or other forms of adult content that is pushing the bounds of content on all platforms
279943 we need to have all of these coordinated and released at the same time because thats the way to get your game out to the most people
279944 i think there are still some problems in the pc market
279945 there are issues in the market from a business standpoint which means having a pc only title that the level of investment to make a triple a game is a tough thing if your not doing a subscription model
279946 to open that up for the type of games we make isnt really appealing to us
279947 world of warcraft i can understand that they have a service based aspect to that game with our games we have always been about the free multiplayer stuff
279948 ik heb ontzettend aardige mensen ontmoet en nu ga ik er een eco vriendelijk hotel laten bouwen
279949 het wordt zonder fossiele brandstoffen gebouwd in abu dhabi waar ze al die olie tot hun beschikking hebben
279950 e3 this year in my opinion it was pretty much disappointing to everybody
279951 the press were disappointed the people i talked to in the industry are disappointed almost everyone agree that that was the wrong way to do it
279952 i think we struck a balance of being vendor supported and still being in touch with the gamers
279953 we had over 6 000 hours of volunteer time thats like the polar opposite of e3 which is all about business
279954 its crazy but its true i only want to be with you
279955 if the red sox trade manny ramirez to florida i will become a marlins fan
279956 be used in a variety of interpersonal situations to look smart connect with friends and family and even move up the socio economic ladder
279957 al comune di fasano c bisogno di un piano di recupero del senso politico dei consiglieri comunali di alleanza nazionale escluso il consigliere mimmo capozzi per questa attivit non c bisogno di delega ma di atti misericordiosi
279958 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
279959 he had no reason to lay off as a group some of our lowest paid workers
279960 theyre not making much anyway and now theyre making nothing
279961 the governor did an end run around the labor process and the government code
279962 its not simply flipping a switch and all of the salaries of identified employees go to 1 100 a month
279963 the state constitution and a supreme court decision clearly support the governors action
279964 he is prepared to defend this in court if necessary to protect the states ability to meet its obligations
279965 i think the leaders share the governors sense of urgency in getting a budget as soon as possible
279966 i think it will hit heavy on the way back to san diego when they realize they wont be doing this again
279967 people are already used to how things are done in those systems
279968 assignment and settlement agreement pursuant to mo rev stat section 537 065 1986

279970 ley derechos de los ni os ni as y adolescentes a la disciplina sin castigo f sico ni trato humillante
279971 ense ar a los padres madres y encargados de los ni os y ni as a educar con amor disciplina y ejemplo y no con castigo corporal
279972 quien corrige con violencia cosecha violencia un ni o agredido en su hogar saldr a empu ar un arma en su barrio en lugar de recibir un diploma en un colegio
279973 si en cambio corregimos con amor restamos j venes en los callejones y los sumamos en las universidades y empresas porque un ni o sin golpes es un ni o con oportunidades y porque un joven sin humillaciones es un joven con metas y sue os propios
279974 el pa s debe concentrarse en promover nuevas formas de educaci n sin violencia ense ando a los padres de familia mecanismos novedosos de aprendizaje orientados al establecimiento de l mites para sus hijos pero para nada se puede justificar los golpes
279975 la idea es hacer la menor cantidad de modificaciones en la regulaci n y aprovecharlas de la mejor manera obviamente respetando las normas de cada pa s y ofreciendo condiciones ideales tanto para emisores como para intermediarios e inversionistas de lado y lado de la frontera
279976 unjustly enriched at the expense of and detriment of costco
279977 the suspect was on the transformer and grabbed one of the live wires
279978 this was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
279979 spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
279980 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
279981 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
279982 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
279983 the recently revealed lawsuit that was sheepishly leaked to the press by troyers attorney is an abomination of the legal process
279984 their professionalism was something i learned from over the past couple years its something a lot of people will have to carry on
279985 were not going to rush i know now hes very excited his brothers here
279986 presunto coautor de los delitos de homicidio en persona protegida concierto para delinquir y terrorismo

279989 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
279990 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
279991 is proposing to offset the cost of his emergency energy rebates over the next five years by enacting a windfall profits tax on big oil companies
279992 obama simply asks that big oil companies contribute a reasonable share of the windfall profits they receive from high oil prices over the next five years to pay for emergency assistance for families right now
279993 what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
279994 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
279995 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
279996 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
279997 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
279998 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
279999 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
