7520177 at the time i realized that like most men i was clueless about prostate cancer and at how little men know about their own bodies
7520178 i later realized that i could use my own abilities to help raise awareness by drawing attention to prostate cancer im hoping more men will get prostate checkups and psa screenings and that more research will focus on this disease when was the last time you heard someone talk about prostate cancer
7520179 it has been a gratifying experience i was one man but the support generosity and personal stories of so many wonderful people who traveled with me in my heart lifted my kayak along the way i met hundreds of men of all ages and their families many of who have been touched directly by prostate cancer for others it was the first time they really thought about this disease if i reached just a dozen men who are now committed to annual prostate screening and early detection it has been worth the effort

7520205 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7520206 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7520207 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7520208 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7520209 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7520210 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
7520211 im not very nice to my mother and i dont get along with my sister
7520212 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7520213 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7520214 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7520215 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7520216 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7520217 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7520218 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7520219 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7520220 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7520221 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7520222 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7520223 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7520224 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7520225 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7520226 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7520227 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7520228 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7520229 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7520230 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7520231 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7520232 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7520233 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7520234 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7520235 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7520236 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
7520237 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
7520238 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
7520239 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7520240 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7520241 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7520242 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7520243 being able to race in front of a large crowd of enthusiastic fans is something special for any racing driver and i am looking forward to being part of this excitement at barcelona
7520244 i can hardly await getting behind the wheel of the audi a4 dtm
7520245 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7520246 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7520247 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7520248 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7520249 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7520250 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7520251 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7520252 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7520253 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7520254 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7520255 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7520256 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7520257 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7520258 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7520259 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7520260 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

7520262 i would suggest that christian activists act in a different fashion
7520263 interestingly one group that over consumes the mini packs is chronic dieters individuals constantly trying to manage their weight and food intake
7520264 on the one hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be a generous portion of food numerous small food morsels in each pack and multiple mini packs in each box on the other hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be diet food for chronic dieters this perceptual dilemma causes a tendency to overeat due to their emotion laden relationship with food
7520265 while restrained eaters may be attracted to smaller foods in smaller packages initially presumably because these products are thought to help consumers with their diets our research shows that restrained eaters actually tend to consume more of these foods than they would of regular foods
7520266 the effects of reduced food size and package size on the consumption behavior of restrained and unrestrained eaters
7520267 in order to have effective prevention we need to know who is getting infected today not 10 years ago
7520268 parents usually dont understand their role in the course of their childs career development and cross the line between involvement and intervention
7520269 sports is one of the most popular interests in the school this can be seen by the fact that the athletes needs are met through designing special programs consideration of their needs consideration of their teachers competitions and placing the school athletics program high on our list of priorities
7520270 sports is as popular a subject as communications and electronics but sports raise school pride while other areas of study do not
7520271 they are cognizant of their own needs but not the needs of others its not a good part of their character or their personality the contempt for others their condescending behavior and their feeling of superiority
7520272 for young athletes those that are active in sports leagues and primarily those that represent their school there are unique needs that require special handling given that the focus on athletic achievements and the pride they bring the school could harm other educational values that students should be taught
7520273 its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7520274 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year there is a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7520275 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
7520276 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else

7520279 a guy wouldnt be so desperate if he didnt have to pay so much for the stuff
7520280 when addicts could carry on like normal people drugs were cheap and it didnt take a lot of money to get all you needed an addict kept his respect and remained congenial and polite to meet him then you wouldnt have known he was a drug fiend
7520281 little doubt that the european system of cheap drugs and medical treatment is infinitely superior to our faltering system of straight police suppression
7520282 violently opposed by those who profit from drug trafficking and one should expect opposition and interference from such criminals
7520283 restlessness hedonism selfishness ingratitude parasitism cruelty resentment of discipline and lack of concern for the future
7520284 determined to go ahead to see if we can prove that it will work
7520285 with a family who took to drugs two months ago and wants to stop before he loses his job and is caught by the police
7520286 you cant learn to face and handle life by being in an incubator
7520287 that is unless youre going to live there permanently and that will be your life
7520288 the result of increasing police pressure on the drug market which usually results in inferior drugs and a wider variety of potentially dangerous drugs such as barbiturates being used as a substitute for heroin
7520289 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie

7520296 testimony could describe a legend because it goes right back to the time and place of the event itself
7520297 as gary habermas points out most scholars even liberals believe that this testimony was part of an early creed that dates right back to the resurrection itself eighteen months to eight years after but some say even earlier
7520298 most scholars believe that this testimony was part of an early creed
7520299 most scholars believe that this creed dates right back to the resurrection itself
7520300 theres no possible way that such testimony could describe a legend because it goes right back to the time and place of the event itself
7520301 it certainly seems fair to say its no more appropriate to take the hardest and most fantastic part of a piece of literature and write all the rest of it off as a result than it is to take the most sober corroborated piece of literature and use that as a reason for believing everything else in the document
7520302 had little need or occasion to refer back to jesus earthly ministry
7520303 no evidence at all for any views they may have held
7520304 no ancient opponent of early christianity ever denied that jesus existed this is the achiless heel of attempts by a few modern scholars such as g a wells to deny that jesus existed
7520305 of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one
7520306 by christians out of hostility and by jews as a means of self protection
7520307 that singular cornerstone of christian belief the mysterious universality and finality of meaning of jesus the christ
7520308 spiega la cirelli docente di psichiatria dellateneo americano alcuni scienziati ipotizzano addirittura che il sonno sia un modo semplice per imporre al corpo uno stato di quiete e immobilita e non sia di per se stesso importante per mammiferi e uccelli dunque almeno in linea teorica si potrebbe rinunciare a pisolini e pennichelle senza troppi danni limitandosi a restare zitti e fermi si tratta della cosiddetta ipotesi nulla respinta pero al mittente da cirelli e tononi il sonno sostengono infatti gli studiosi non e affatto una pausa inutile ancora non comprendiamo appieno lo scopo del sonno ma deve essere qualcosa di importante dal momento che lo fanno tutti
7520309 puo essere il prezzo pagato per essere dotati di un cervello plastico e fresco il giorno dopo

7520315 grey wolfs customer base experienced employees and rig fleet will be enhanced by precisions high performance systems and super series rig technology
7520316 together we can deliver high value services that will provide significant value to our customers employees and security holders
7520317 grey wolfs board of directors believes this improved offer from precision is in the best interests of grey wolf shareholders customers and employees and we are pleased we have been able to reach this agreement
7520318 today we have over 7 5 million beneficiaries of microfinance bank loans in bangladesh
7520319 the advantage of the loans given to these poor was that majority of the wards of the beneficiaries are now graduates who run their own businesses without looking for job from the government
7520320 i am very very humble in victory and i am encouraged by this support to put in more to serve the people i want to commend inec for conducting a free and fair election
7520321 it has served to strengthen us and all cross riverians it has strengthened our resolve to serve our people and to do even better than we did before we are not going to have any excuses because we now have total support of the people
7520322 governance is about serving the people and there are going to be changes when necessary governance is not about who gets what
7520323 this is the most peaceful election so far no snatching of ballot boxes materials arrived early and elections started as early as 8 am in some places
7520324 the rapid growth of the national oil company sector has outstripped the availability of employees in many parts of the world and it is now a real risk to the future of some of these companies as they and their contractors struggle to meet demand and deal with the issues created by a workforce approaching retirement age
7520325 this report finds an interesting dichotomy between the largest and smaller national oil companies and their concerns
7520326 a further important finding of the report should be noted and that is the increasingly important role that service companies are playing through the key projects they have undertaken with nocs i predict that the growing power of service companies will play a significant role in the future of the industry
7520327 senator yerima is trying to create a situation of argument and in the process create tension in the state by heating up the polity just to distract the developmental programmes of the government thereby making it look as if it is the governor that is causing the problems
7520328 what is happening in zamfara state today as far as i am concerned is fuelled by people who double speak and tell lies
7520329 yarima was the head of last administration which i was part of i know and it is a fact that some basic amenities that ought to have been provided by that regime were not provided some towns needed roads we did not provide some needed hospitals and the likes but were not provided so since we have gotten one among us who is providing these facilities we should support him in whatever way we can
7520330 i only imagine what would have been happening to us all had either the pdp or dpp won the state as i said we should be grateful that one of our own is doing the work and is doing it well
7520331 the level of progress recorded by this administration in just one year in office has surpassed all his achievements recorded in eight years and he is jealous
7520332 yarima is afraid the present administrations policy of developing all sectors in all parts of the state has started making shinkafi a toast to all categories of people in the whole state
7520333 will however not be held hostage by those who had powers yesterday but failed to make judicious use of it
7520334 we challenge the pdp to provide evidence to support their allegation failing which we meet in the court
7520335 we were outraged by the statement because of its national security implications and therefore challenge the pdp to go the whole hog by exposing the foreign entities invovled and details of the plot
7520336 cnpp also wishes to reassure nigerians that nud is not working with any foreign group either overtly or covertly and subscribes to the truism that democracy remains the best form of government especially where the sanctity of the ballot box is upheld and the primacy of the peoples vote counts
7520337 transcended its literal functionality to become an iconic symbol of the ideal
7520338 almost branded icons of hopeful we can beat them better mousetraps
7520339 right now it stands for dont confuse me with the facts
7520340 to sail around the world on my own and have the best time of my life
7520341 we hebben het hiertoe beperkt omdat dit het meeste voorkomt en er over de behandeling van deze lichte vormen veel onduidelijkheden bestaan
7520342 de pati nt moet weten dat de pijn gaat toenemen maar dat het toch belangrijk is de nek te bewegen
7520343 in de literatuur is geen voordeel voor de nekkraag te vinden de kraag druist in tegen het hele idee te bewegen
7520344 itu karena adanya perbedaan pendapat diantara elemen umat islam apakah awal masuk dan keluarnya bulan ramadhan itu ditentukan oleh ru yatul hilal melihat hilal ataukah dengan ilmu hisab
7520345 karena adanya perbedaan pendapat apakah di dunia ini hanya berlaku satu mathla tempat keluarnya hilal ataukah masing masing negeri mempunyai mathla sendiri sendiri
7520346 apa hubungannya antara ketaatan terhadap penguasa dengan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan
7520347 barangsiapa menaatiku berarti telah menaati allah barangsiapa menentangku berarti telah menentang allah barangsiapa menaati pemimpin umat ku berarti telah menaatiku dan barangsiapa menentang pemimpin umat ku berarti telah menentangku
7520348 di dalam hadits ini terdapat keterangan tentang kewajiban menaati para penguasa dalam perkara perkara yang bukan kemaksiatan adapun hikmahnya adalah untuk menjaga persatuan dan kebersamaan umat islam karena di dalam perpecahan terdapat kerusakan
7520349 seseorang hendaknya bershaum bersama penguasa dan jamaah mayoritas umat islam baik ketika cuaca cerah ataupun mendung
7520350 sebagian ahlul ilmi menafsirkan hadits ini 1 dengan ucapan mereka sesungguhnya shaum dan berbukanya itu dilaksanakan bersama dan mayoritas umat islam
7520351 yang jelas makna hadits ini adalah bahwasanya perkara perkara semacam ini menentukan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan berbuka puasa iedul fithri dan iedul adha pen keputusannya bukanlah di tangan individu tidak ada hak bagi mereka untuk melakukannya sendiri sendiri bahkan permasalahan semacam ini dikembalikan kepada penguasa dan mayoritas umat islam dalam hal ini setiap individu pun wajib untuk mengikuti penguasa dan mayoritas umat islam maka dari itu jika ada seseorang yang melihat hilal bulan sabit namun penguasa menolak persaksiannya sudah sepatutnya untuk tidak dianggap persaksian tersebut dan wajib baginya untuk mengikuti mayoritas umat islam dalam permasalahan itu
7520352 dan selama belum terwujud bersatunya negeri negeri islam di atas satu mathla dalam menentukan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan pen aku berpendapat bahwa setiap warga negara hendaknya melaksanakan shaum ramadhan bersama negaranya pemerintahnya masing masing dan tidak bercerai berai dalam perkara ini yakni shaum bersama pemerintah dan sebagian lainnya shaum bersama negara lain baik mendahului pemerintahnya atau pun belakangan karena yang demikian itu dapat mempertajam perselisihan di tengah masyarakat muslim sendiri sebagaimana yang terjadi di sebagian negara arab sejak beberapa tahun yang lalu wallahul mustaan
7520353 inilah yang sesuai dengan syariat islam yang toleran yang diantara misinya adalah mempersatukan umat manusia menyatukan barisan mereka serta menjauhkan mereka dari segala pendapat pribadi yang memicu perpecahan
7520354 aku telah shalat di mina hari hari haji pen bersama nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam abu bakr umar dan di awal pemerintahan utsman 2 rakaat dan setelah itu utsman shalat 4 rakaat kemudian terjadilah perbedaan diantara kalian sebagian shalat 4 rakaat dan sebagian lagi 2 rakaat pen dan harapanku dari 4 rakaat shalat itu yang diterima adalah yang 2 rakaat darinya
7520355 engkau telah mengingkari utsman atas shalatnya yang 4 rakaat mengapa kemudian engkau shalat 4 rakaat pula
7520356 jika awal masuknya bulan ramadhan telah diumumkan di salah satu negeri islam semisal kerajaan saudi arabia namun di negeri kami belum diumumkan bagaimanakah hukumnya apakah kami bershaum bersama kerajaan saudi arabia ataukah bershaum dan berbuka bersama penduduk negeri kami manakala ada pengumuman demikian pula halnya dengan masuknya iedul fithri apa yang harus kami lakukan bila terjadi perbedaan antara negeri kami dengan negeri yang lainnya semoga allah subhanahu wa taala membalas engkau dengan kebaikan
7520357 setiap muslim hendaknya bershaum dan berbuka bersama pemerintah negerinya masing masing hal itu berdasarkan sabda nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
7520358 waktu shaum itu di hari kalian umat islam bershaum waktu berbuka adalah pada saat kalian berbuka dan waktu berkurban iedul adha di hari kalian berkurban
7520359 umat islam di luar dunia islam sering berselisih dalam menyikapi berbagai macam permasalahan seperti penentuan masuk dan keluarnya bulan ramadhan serta saling berebut jabatan di bidang dakwah fenomena ini terjadi setiap tahun hanya saja tingkat ketajamannya berbeda beda tiap tahunnya penyebab utamanya adalah minimnya ilmu agama mengikuti hawa nafsu dan terkadang fanatisme madzhab atau partai tanpa mempedulikan rambu rambu syariat islam dan bimbingan para ulama yang kesohor akan ilmu dan wara nya maka adakah sebuah nasehat yang kiranya bermanfaat dan dapat mencegah terjadinya sekian kejelekan semoga allah subhanahu wa taala memberikan taufiq dan penjagaan nya kepada engkau
7520360 umat islam wajib bersatu dan tidak boleh berpecah belah dalam beragama sebagaimana firman allah subhanahu wa taala
7520361 dia telah mensyariatkan bagi kalian tentang agama apa yang telah diwasiatkan nya kepada nuh dan apa yang telah kami wasiatkan kepadamu ibrahim musa dan isa yaitu tegakkanlah agama dan janganlah kalian berpecah belah tentangnya
7520362 dan berpegang teguhlah kalian semua dengan tali agama allah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai
7520363 dan janganlah kalian seperti orang orang yang berpecah belah dan berselisih setelah keterangan datang kepada mereka dan bagi mereka adzab yang pedih
7520364 dan tidak mengapa bagi penduduk negeri manapun jika tidak melihat hilal bulan tsabit di tempat tinggalnya pada malam ke 30 untuk mengambil hasil ru yatul hilal dari tempat lain di negerinya jika umat islam di negeri tersebut berbeda pendapat dalam hal penentuannya maka yang harus diikuti adalah keputusan penguasa di negeri tersebut bila ia seorang muslim karena dengan mengikuti keputusannya akan sirnalah perbedaan pendapat itu dan jika si penguasa bukan seorang muslim maka hendaknya mengikuti keputusan majelis departemen pusat yang membidangi urusan umat islam di negeri tersebut hal ini semata mata untuk menjaga kebersamaan umat islam dalam menjalankan shaum ramadhan dan shalat id di negeri mereka wabillahit taufiq washallallahu ala nabiyyina muhammad wa alihi wa shahbihi wasallam
7520365 dan berpegang teguhlah kalian semua dengan tali agama allah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai
7520366 allah subhanahu wa taala mewajibkan kepada kita agar berpegang teguh dengan kitab nya al qur an dan sunnah nabi nya serta merujuk kepada keduanya di saat terjadi perselisihan
7520367 wahai orang orang yang beriman taatilah allah dan rasul nya dan ulil amri diantara kalian
7520368 yang dimaksud dengan ulil amri adalah orang orang yang allah subhanahu wa taala wajibkan untuk ditaati dari kalangan para penguasa dan pemimpin umat
7520369 wahai rasulullah kami tidak bertanya kepadamu tentang ketaatan terhadap penguasa yang bertakwa yang kami tanyakan adalah ketaatan terhadap penguasa yang berbuat demikian dan demikian ia sebutkan kejelekan kejelekannya
7520370 akan ada sepeninggalku nanti para imam penguasa yang mereka itu tidak berpegang dengan petunjukku dan tidak mengikuti cara jalanku dan akan ada diantara para penguasa tersebut orang orang yang berhati setan namun berbadan manusia
7520371 hendaknya engkau mendengar dan menaati penguasa tersebut walaupun punggungmu dicambuk dan hartamu dirampas olehnya maka dengarkanlah perintahnya dan taatilah dia
7520372 seburuk buruk penguasa kalian adalah yang kalian benci dan mereka pun membenci kalian kalian mencaci mereka dan mereka pun mencaci kalian
7520373 jangan selama mereka masih mendirikan shalat di tengah tengah kalian dan jika kalian melihat mereka mengerjakan perbuatan yang tidak kalian sukai maka bencilah perbuatannya dan jangan mencabut meninggalkan ketaatan darinya
7520374 urusan kaum muslimin tidaklah stabil tanpa adanya penguasa yang baik atau yang jahat sekalipun
7520375 wahai amirul mukminin kalau penguasa yang baik kami bisa menerimanya lalu bagaimana dengan yang jahat
7520376 sesungguhnya walaupun penguasa itu jahat namun allah subhanahu wa taala tetap memerankannya sebagai pengawas keamanan di jalan jalan dan pemimpin dalam jihad
7520377 adapun kewajiban menaati mereka penguasa tetaplah berlaku walaupun mereka berbuat jahat karena tidak menaati mereka dalam hal yang maruf akan mengakibatkan kerusakan yang jauh lebih besar dari apa yang ada selama ini dan di dalam kesabaran terhadap kejahatan mereka itu terdapat ampunan dari dosa dosa serta mendatangkan pahala yang berlipat
7520378 ketahuilah bahwa kejahatan penguasa tidaklah menghapuskan kewajiban menaati mereka pen yang allah subhanahu wa taala wajibkan melalui lisan nabi nya kejahatannya akan kembali kepada dirinya sendiri sedangkan kebaikan kebaikan yang engkau kerjakan bersamanya akan mendapat pahala yang sempurna insya allah yakni kerjakanlah shalat berjamaah shalat jumat dan jihad bersama mereka dan juga berpartisipasilah bersamanya dalam semua jenis ketaatan yang dipimpinnya
7520379 telah sepakat para ulama ahli fiqh ilmu dan ahli ibadah dan juga dari kalangan ubbad ahli ibadah dan zuhhad orang orang zuhud sejak generasi pertama umat ini hingga masa kita ini bahwa shalat jumat idul fitri dan idul adha hari hari mina dan arafah jihad haji serta penyembelihan qurban dilakukan bersama penguasa yang baik ataupun yang jahat
7520380 aku telah bertemu dengan 1 000 orang lebih dari ulama hijaz makkah dan madinah kufah bashrah wasith baghdad syam dan mesir
7520381 aku tidak melihat adanya perbedaan diantara mereka tentang perkara berikut ini beliau lalu menyebutkan sekian perkara diantaranya kewajiban menaati penguasa dalam hal yang maruf
7520382 di dalam hadits ini riwayat al bukhari dan muslim dari shahabat abu hurairah di atas pen terdapat keterangan tentang kewajiban menaati para penguasa dalam perkara perkara yang bukan kemaksiatan adapun hikmahnya adalah untuk menjaga persatuan dan kebersamaan umat islam karena di dalam perpecahan terdapat kerusakan

7520407 we talked about what wed done well in the first five or six games before that auckland test and went back to what we saw as our strengths and that worked for us
7520408 to lose vicks pretty early on we did a lot of work on our lineout throughout the week obviously with him running the show and for those guys to come in and hold it together for the rest of the game was full credit to jimmy horwill and to mummy as well when he came on

7520446 the logistics industry recorded strong growth over the past decade due to globalization and an increased demand for imported goods

7520615 our foreign secretary is in the u s and the two delegations have been meeting
7520616 the united states and india will continue our vigorous joint advocacy for the initiative at the highest levels of nsg government
7520617 we will continue to work with our indian partners to persuade the nuclear suppliers group countries that such an exemption is in the international communitys best interest
7520618 wake up were going to the pool in 20 minutes if you want to come youve got to get up the kids are getting antsy
7520619 well dont be like that i was just asking how you were doing
7520620 whats the matter old man never did anything wild in your life
7520621 got drunk once and had sex with a peacock i was just wondering if you were my son
7520622 at the moment we have a web of documents but the semantic web aims for the web of data
7520623 the semantic web wants computers not only to be able to process but also to understand data
7520624 if you talk to warren hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
7520625 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
7520626 the president of the united states will adopt the wording the world
7520627 perche ti metti a leggere quelle schifezze non potresti utilizzare il tuo tempo per leggere un vero libro di qualche vero scrittore
7520628 perche dunque non lo incontri li in strada il tuo mondo perche ti ostini a cercarlo nel web
7520629 in strada ormai non si esprime piu nessuno mentre nel web sembra che tutti abbiano qualcosa da dire e se voglio addentrarmi sotto la scorza superficiale internet e il luogo ideale per farlo
7520630 ahora no firmar a que el huesca se salvara en la ltima jornada

7520633 i was summonded to a hotel room in town asked for my access pass and told not to go back to the office and that my desk would be packed up and f hrungswechsel bei der rea group
7520634 i was summonded to a hotel room in town asked for my access pass and told not to go back to the office and that my desk would be packed up and f hrungswechsel bei der rea group
7520635 whosoever gives up the golan heights abandons the security of the state of israel
7520636 are you strong enough to be my man or my president
7520637 what im hearing from sen obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy
7520638 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7520639 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7520640 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7520641 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues
7520642 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7520643 its like honey what do you want to be a pariah what do you want to be crucified its a good thing in this country we dont have to tell anybody its no ones business who we vote for
7520644 i will be able to dance i went to the hospital ill be fine
7520645 i am very pleased that were going to have the roll call vote i think that was very important to do but i dont think that means those people are against barack obama
7520646 there may be some who are still unhappy about the outcome and that is understandable but as i say they are democrats and they understand that if we are going to take the country in a new direction we cannot have four more years of george bush and thats what john mccain would be
7520647 i would love to see a woman president a woman vice president a woman on the ticket every single time
7520648 but its no use discussing it we have a candidate
7520649 the challenge then is for people to better understand who he is
7520650 if others will criticize him because he is lofty in his aspirations we have to make sure that people know that those aspirations are not for himself but for working families
7520651 izolas been here as a stabilizing force for over 50 years
7520652 you always know izolas is open 24 hours six days a week
7520653 she always got time to talk and keep you up on whats going on
7520654 laluji and guruji soren came to my residence as per our traditional values atithi deva bhava guests are like god moreover after giving a second thought i decided to support him in the interest of upas unity
7520655 i told during the meeting with lalu prasad and soren to continue all the unfinished development works taken during my 23 months of tenure
7520656 see both of them koda and stephen are giving the letters of support to him soren
7520657 there is no need for the pml n to be part of the coalition government if one party is taking decisions unilaterally
7520658 pressure should be brought to bear on health and human services secretary mike leavitt
7520659 but it no longer defines some types of contraception as abortion after family planning groups complained an earlier draft would have defined abortion to include birth control pills and the intrauterine device or iud
7520660 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers
7520661 but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial
7520662 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals
7520663 that would be an international marriage would you get married just after one or two blind dates
7520664 our foreign secretary is in the u s and the two delegations have been meeting
7520665 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
7520666 investment in china has been boosted by the governments energy policy which secures renewable energy as a vital and important part of the countrys energy mix
7520667 to make the uk a world leader in attracting investment in this sector and to avoid it slipping further down the index the government needs to consider creating tangible incentives for investors following the lead of germany and the ambition of china
7520668 china is also likely to become a significant exporter of wind turbine equipment in a few years adding to its already strong presence in the solar industry
7520669 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
7520670 everything now hinges on stopping coal whether we prevent runaway climate change largely depends on whether we keep using the most carbon intensive fossil fuel unless we either leave it and the carbon dioxide it produces in the ground human development will start spiralling backwards the more coal is burnt the smaller are our chances of future comfort and prosperity
7520671 ccs ready could be used as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
7520672 let nuclear plant building happen as long as its total emissions are taken into account we know exactly how and where the waste is to be buried how much this will cost and who will pay
7520673 unlike ccs wind wave tidal solar hydro and geothermal power are proven technologies unlike nuclear power they can be safely decommissioned as soon as they become redundant
7520674 it is not because of polar bears that i will be joining the climate camp outside the coal plant at kingsnorth it is not because of butterflies or frogs or penguins or rainforests much as i love them all it is because everything i have fought for and that all campaigners for social justice have ever fought for food clean water shelter security is jeopardised by climate change those who claim to identify a conflict between environmentalism and humanitarianism have either failed to read the science or have refused to understand it
7520675 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs is enormous i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
7520676 itu overshoot disebabkan banyak hal antara lain kena angin dari belakang samping dan belakang jadi tidak pas mendarat

7520678 toen de site net live was genereerde hij 16 000 pageviews per dag dat zakte in de periode daarna in tot zon 2 500 pageviews en is inmiddels opgeklommen naar 4 000 paginas per dag
7520679 maar dat wordt nog behoorlijk wat puzzelen dat is niet iets dat we zo 1 2 3 maken
7520680 i am delighted to present this hawker 4000 to mr deboer who is a nationally recognized entrepreneur and a devoted customer
7520681 just as his hotel accommodation conglomerate exemplifies the comfort in a home away from home the hawker 4000 provides the same comfort with its fully customizable interior while offering segment leading performance perfectly fit for all of his global travel needs
7520682 this seems to suggest that we will have strong growth in fixed investment activity particularly over the next two years
7520683 it looks like it is a factor that will do the trick for us the fact that we have this infrastructure spending that we have this private sector spending is going to keep us out of recession
7520684 it debt service costs is right up there in danger territory
7520685 it is not a pretty picture and it has been reflected in retail sales
7520686 villanova and rutgers are recruiting him hard and both schools have done a great job
7520687 his conditioning has improved as has his work ethic and he is now regularly nailing the 15 foot jump shot once he starts lifting weights regularly he is going to be scary i am happy with his progress he has unofficialed at villanova and will do the same at rutgers and penn state this fall
7520688 i have heard from big east schools who are very interested in frantz as well as some big ten and acc schools
7520689 high major d1 schools are intrigued by his size court vision and passing and ability to get his teammates good shots frantz is the true definition of a lead guard and is a pass first player i have been pushing him to be more aggressive on the offensive end because he can score the ball and in july he did just that i would not be surprised if he chooses a school based on educational value he is very focused on education and his future outside of basketball his gpa is about a 3 4 he has unofficialed at princeton and coach johnson has done a great job recruiting him thus far we are trying to get him to fordham umass temple lasalle and st joes this fall

7520695 tries to empower indian women to use develop and contribute to the world of free and open source software foss
7520696 back when i started being active online revealing ones gender meant the usual picture requests or maybe personal questions after a few mails under the guise of volunteering but i doubt if it will happen to a woman today
7520697 its the lack of infrastructure while the lack of computer access also plays some role most men who dont own computers would use a friends machine women in india would not have the freedom to stay late at a friends place to hack away
7520698 at the entry level volunteering is easy if you know what you want to do also most men ive met so far appreciate the extra efforts put to cross that gnu linux learning curve
7520699 however today its a lot more difficult to be sexist and the existence of foss womens groups makes it tough to get away with negative behaviour
7520700 its been a self taught learning experience thanks to all the online manuals tutorials and mailing lists i started off volunteering with dmoz org and wikipedia communities then linuxchix
7520701 there are few women in technology and fewer still in foss women still have to straddle other responsibilities especially if they are employed women at least in india still havent broken free completely
7520702 knowing a lot of women from rural india i have had a number of discussions with them their parents and later in laws are the ones who decide for them
7520703 the reasons for fewer women in foss seems comparable to the reasons for fewer women in research i personally can quote a number of problems faced
7520704 ma io vi dico in coscienza che se dovesse essere rifatto lo rifarei non la pattuglia

7520707 well there is a place now that will take your stuff but they dont pay you for it
7520708 anti union managers are free to campaign to every employee every day throughout the day but pro union employees can campaign only on break time
7520709 management can post anti union propaganda on bulletin boards and walls while prohibiting pro union employees from doing the same
7520710 employers can force workers to attend mass anti union propaganda events but pro union employees are not given equal time

7520716 support windmills in west virginia not mountaintop removal valley fills
7520717 were optimistic about the potential for local leaders to support this project this would be the biggest wind farm proposed on the east coast and could provide a model for other counties in west virginia looking to develop affordable clean energy and create safe healthy jobs in their own communities
7520718 economic development is of the utmost importance but concern for the well being of citizens is a priority this wind farm could save local communities peoples lives and our way of life while also bringing new economic development to the area this idea is an excellent alternative and maybe the only alternative for our lands which are being permanently destroyed
7520719 not to mention that there is underground mining already on that mountains and the underground mining can go on while the wind farm is in operation
7520720 uefa supports the platform because it has an international focus and seeks to foster a dialogue and strengthen relationships between actors in developing and developed countries committed to using sport as a tool for development

7520739 prior to infoblox we were using a general purpose server based solution to manage all the dns and dhcp services across the network this system was inherently insecure and difficult and timely to patch and upgrade
7520740 there was a distinct effort from our it department to put a more robust secure and stable infrastructure in place and we wanted to go with infoblox the infoblox appliances have unique technology that provides secure and reliable core network services we know we can count on
7520741 before infoblox there was no redundancy and when we had to schedule a network upgrade there was an 8 to 10 hour outage
7520742 now when we upgrade the systems there is no recognizable downtime to our staff and end users that is an incredible cost savings and operational advantage for our it team

7520761 while preserving the mountain for future economic and community benefits
7520762 the national conversation on energy and global warming makes it clear that america needs to start investing heavily in renewable energy as well as get ourselves off foreign sources of energy
7520763 carbon taxes could make coal more expensive in coming years and west virginia needs to prepare itself by developing innovative affordable new sources of domestic energy before that happens
7520764 the importance of coal to west virginia our nation and the world economy is not well understood and is sometimes misrepresented
7520765 some elected officials and others with sincere environmental concerns and some who also have competing economic interests have proposed that coal be eliminated
7520766 these voices are driving the national debate about whether coal truly has a future in america
7520767 despite significant advances the requirement remains for urgent and mandatory efforts to ensure continuing improvements in the safety cleanliness and efficiency of the mining and use of coal
7520768 the future of coal will be significantly influenced by federal and state actions following debate about what types of greenhouse gas regulation will be imposed

7520823 when the student to pc ratio moves from about 9 1 to 3 1 it makes sense to get the computers out of the labs and into the classrooms
7520824 and once there are enough computing stations in each classroom the teachers can personalize lesson plans be more productive and better engage their students

7520847 it is still utterly deceptive because the irrational appeal of proximity to the jackpot motivates the consumer far more than an expressed intent to support the activity advertised

7520870 while there are some rules for tv there are no rules when you move online
7520871 we dont want to reduce junk food advertising to kids on tv and then find that it has just moved to another platform
7520872 listen up fellow parents when we point a collective finger three more are pointing right back at us
7520873 when will we stop playing the victim and start taking personal responsibility for our kids health and eating habits
7520874 have you ever been somewhere where your food choices were confined to starchy fatty or sugary foods when what you really want is a piece of fruit or something healthy
7520875 thats the problem im trying to solve i would love for people especially kids to have healthy choices

7520877 the ideablob prize money will help launch her project and make a difference in her community and beyond
7520878 im making a call to action for all my social media connected friends please be a part of this effort raise visibility and help find the cure i ask that you suggest other things we can do as a community to increase awareness
7520879 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
7520880 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
7520881 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
7520882 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
7520883 major roads play an important role in the economy but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas
7520884 policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones
7520885 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible i know people are angry and rightfully so
7520886 i am prepared to take all that responsibility for the good of the team i still back the players do they suddenly become bad players or is there something else wrong
7520887 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played its just that final thing we are missing either a pass not going to hand or someone having the wrong body position and losing the ball in contact or not working hard enough in support
7520888 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7520889 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7520890 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7520891 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7520892 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7520893 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7520894 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7520895 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7520896 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7520897 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7520898 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7520899 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7520900 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be
7520901 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7520902 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7520903 i am not going to talk about the politics of it
7520904 ill just say that sen biden is a very fine statesman i have known him for a long time he has been a really very supportive committee chair and before that ranking member for the state department and our diplomatic efforts
7520905 what is it with you and lora leigh dont they all just blend into one book after awhile
7520906 abry is one of the most experienced private equity firms in the media communications and information industry we believe they are the right partner to continue our aggressive growth plans while providing outstanding service to our valued customers

7520909 we are very excited to offer a high availability dns solution to the market its capabilities give our customers another level of reliability and an effective mechanism for maintaining business continuity
7520910 as a parent and a teacher i like this idea in order to give families personal time as an environmentalist it makes sense to cut down on energy use and transportation costs with such an alternative schedule
7520911 a four day a week calendar means longer days for students to meet these minimum requirements for the littlest ones this is a concern from a developmental perspective for oldest ones the long day means not much is accomplished during the last hour of the day when fatigue and boredom set in
7520912 you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7520913 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7520914 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response of the police
7520915 i dont know who to be mad at any more
7520916 we couldnt take the risk that if something went wrong we could be in debt for 100 000 or more to have these babies delivered
7520917 financially it was a no brainer for lynette to move out of nevada but emotionally for both of us its just awful
7520918 we believe that removing any funds from the wisconsin fund could cause the system in wisconsin to destabilize and feel it is prudent to leave the system as it is
7520919 at that time some insurance carriers would not insure doctors at all other carriers wouldnt insure certain specialists such as orthopedists neurosurgeons and anesthesiologists
7520920 in fact the state bar of wisconsin the medical society and the insurance industry all opposed it
7520921 the insurance companies who provide medical liability coverage here know that any one case will not cost more than a million dollars
7520922 even though thats still a lot of money its a very limited amount
7520923 i left a wonderful practice and great partners in a nice area close to my family
7520924 the medical liability crisis escalated to the point where it wasnt really an option anymore to practice in the state of pennsylvania
7520925 theres not a single hospital in south philadelphia that has a maternity service not a single one
7520926 all we need is a reduction in reimbursement and another rise in malpractice premiums and were dead meat
7520927 one trial lawyer claims doctors are injuring people left and right
7520928 but we wont have to worry about that because there wont be anybody left to take care of people here
7520929 some are opting out of delivering babies and just going to stay with gyney gynecology work and they cant find obs here
7520930 because i think illinois is going to go through an absolutely amazing crisis in the next 12 to 24 months access to health care is going to be horrible
7520931 people just dont understand how this could be possible in henderson a las vegas suburb
7520932 so how can you have one of the fastest growing communities in the u s have doctors leaving its just amazing
7520933 you should have doctors swarming here to take on the increased patient load
7520934 what happened to me is not going to become the exception its going to become the rule
7520935 im going out there and will be there for the next two weeks and see if i can happen to be there when theyre born
7520936 i think steve is kicking himself in the pit area right now im not sure why he took the low line there at the end it was his race to lose i have to thank my guys it is good to be on a roll like this heading into the postseason
7520937 this is the first time we have won in this car
7520938 things are going good right now but like i said we shouldnt have had this one tonight i could only get my car to work on the cushion and when steve stayed low i thought i might have a chance

7520963 we started the season off really well getting lots of points and being bloody reliable and things were going our way then it all started at the hockenheim test and we have struggled since then we havent been competitive in any session anywhere or any race

7520988 i personally put our bad start to the season down to the new stadium we dropped some points that any team will drop when they move to a new stadium it is linked with the unfamiliarity as well as the fact that a team that comes to the stadium has no bad memories

7520990 we drew at wigan on sunday and i was asked about the state of the pitch after the game of course i would have preferred a better pitch because frankly it was a disaster the excuse is that wigan have a rugby team who play on the pitch but having a surface like that is disrespectful for the fans who come and pay money to see the game

7520992 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7520993 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7520994 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7520995 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7520996 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7520997 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7520998 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7520999 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7521000 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7521001 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

7521045 we must note with bitterness the threat of a progressive deterioration in the climate of confidence and cooperation that should characterize relations between nations
7521046 with which humanity strives to form that common awareness of being the family of nations that john paul ii indicated as the ideal to the general assembly of the united nations
7521047 we must deepen the awareness of being united by a common destiny that in the final analysis is a transcendent destiny to avert the return to nationalistic conflicts that in other historical periods have had such tragic consequences
7521048 the recent events have weakened the confidence in many that such experiences had been consigned to the past
7521049 we must instead actively commit ourselves to reject the temptation to confront new situations with old systems
7521050 routes to take with tenacity and creativity to build fruitful and sincere relations and to guarantee to present and future generations times of concord and moral and civil progress
7521051 in a country of primarily orthodox religion the fact that the head of the catholic church should be concerned in such a determined way about the ongoing conflict and that he keeps the georgian people in his heart and prays for them has caused a great impression
7521052 arrived suddenly and who didnt even have a mattress to lie on
7521053 there still is tension people cannot understand why despite the agreements everything is blocked and no one can go wherever he wishes
7521054 both the georgian government and the orthodox patriarchate have requested aid from the catholic church and we are doing everything possible with a great spirit of collaboration

7521073 it feels so great to be back on the scene
7521074 i went through a struggle and i really needed to get myself together and connect with my purpose which is music
7521075 music is all i know to be on this set today i feel very blessed for the second chance and for the opportunity my record company believing in me and everybody here just showing me so much love and support my fans it just feels good to be back and i never wanna leave for that long again

7521077 i mean at the end of the day we wanted to do something for the fans and show the world that we got this chemistry that cant be denied and cant be stopped
7521078 its definitely a big pop sounding album international sounding but she hits a little bit on the country side
7521079 vocally she does a lot of little country twangs with her voice we kid around we joke around that the next album is gonna be country were both gonna step out and do some country music but were kinda tapping into it to show that you can mix that sound with urban and r amp b and hip hop its just music and good music lives
7521080 i wanted to make it for everybody not just urban but every race every color every creed whatever
7521081 i just wanted to make a universal album and thats what we did and we accomplished that and im really excited about it its out november 11 and we launch it november 10 with oprah so im really excited
7521082 i wrote the title track to the album and basically what that song is about is forgiveness mistakes are gonna be made were all gonna make them one of the lines in the song is im only human i might just tell a lie im only human im an angel in disguise theres another song on the album called warm it up with love im talking about how the whole world is freezing but we just need to warm the world up with love then theres piano man where i go to this piano man and ask him to play a song of love play a song about heartache so we can have the whole world singing tonight its really some cool concepts on the album
7521083 you can take it like youre talking about a mother and a daughter a sister brother girlfriend whatever its universal in that way
7521084 and the video concept is me crossing over to the other side and coming back into my familys life just popping up everywhere just singing to them and its got an i am legend feel sometimes you see me on the street by myself completely and its pretty cool little x is directing it im really excited about it i just hope it turns out great and everybody loves it

7521110 weve been working pretty well together i feel really comfortable with him behind the plate really it comes down to mixing up pitches and keeping hitters off balance keeping them guessing hes done a great job with that
7521111 with him it seems like were on the same page after the first or second hitter
7521112 it seems like we fall into a good rhythm he had really good stuff today it was down the fastball seemed like it was overpowering
7521113 lou just gave me his point of view of what he thought i should change
7521114 i was able to work on that a little in the cage but i cant think of stuff like that while im at bat so i wasnt able to fully introduce whatever he told me to in todays at bat
7521115 the telltale sign is hes not driving the ball to left field like what i saw in spring training
7521116 that says hes taking off too soon and his stride is a little long hes just got to get back to what he was doing he was getting into a good hitting count earlier in the year and he had some good swings when he did have a good pitch to hit
7521117 other players on the team were more excited than i was i really appreciate all the support and because of that it makes me want to succeed even more

7521156 i say frankly on a private level that i always intend to stay true to these statements i do always say what i actually feel at that time after each metal gear when i say i am going to move on to the next project but its like when hayao miyazaki says he is not going to do more and then always ends up doing it i think i am kind of in a similar situation i have ideas other than metal gear and i want to go on to make other new games but for political business or technology reasons there is always a time when i have to return but i have to say my feeling hasnt changed i would like to pass on the metal gear series to younger staff members and then go on to produce the title and not be so attached to it
7521157 i always want to be in a creative position where i can concentrate and grow as a creator i feel if i dont do that i might as well not be in the industry but on the other hand i am looking after and responsible for the business side of konami as a whole as well as for kojima productions and it would be ridiculous for me on the business side to say i will just bring out a game every four years therefore i would like to keep doing what i do but at the same time pass my own ideas to the staff who can take over and produce thats what i have been doing and i would like to keep doing it this way and in my spare time i want to establish a new game which i have been wanting to do for a long time i do have strong urges to create a new title other than the metal gear series as a businessperson i might worry whether it will sell more than the metal gear series but thats another issue but when i said its a difficult question to answer i mean that when we look ten years into the future maybe yes i may well end up spending more time on the metal gear series
7521158 its absolutely surreal i never thought that this would be possible i wasnt even sure of my medal chances at all after i did my last dive and i saw i was in first i thought thats it its a silver medal i am so happy with this and then i won i cant believe it im so happy
7521159 its very special its very special for me its not easy to achieve this for me after hard work after so much effort
7521160 my main target was always 2012 it wasnt actually these olympics im only 19 this was my first games and people tend not to win anything at their first games
7521161 i would go as far as to award her a separate medal i have enormous respect for what she has done and just looking at someone like her is an inspiration
7521162 all i can say is yo jamaican sprinters are taking over the world
7521163 i admit the system is good at getting medals but it is too focused on competition

7521171 this is just another reason why we play in bathing suits
7521172 i have to say that after the first game a 2 0 loss to norway i didnt know the gold medal would be possible but we took it one game at a time and kept believing in ourselves my focus this whole tournament was just to work hard and things will come
7521173 i mourn the loss of my father in law greatly my heart aches for my wife and for our family for their loss on the other hand i am extremely proud and happy for my team those are the two emotions i have and they are a little bit conflicted obviously i cannot change what happened in either sphere i can just embrace whats occurred and try to deal with it accordingly
7521174 they say nba players cant play together they can its not about the name on the back of the jersey its the three letters on the front
7521175 i couldnt have been here without my parents both of my parents have been a big influence on my life my dad is in the gym with me every day hes the reason i am an olympic champion my mom is on my side providing emotional support its an equal effort i couldnt have achieved this without either of them so im very thankful and i give them a lot of credit

7521208 immigration hasnt been a central issue in past campaigns but thats changing this year
7521209 our platform on immigration is much better than the democrats its tying in to positions on globalization and free trade any free trade pact should have free passage over borders like in the eu
7521210 this will be a reflection of what the green party can offer minorities
7521211 the green party is not well known by latinos yet but this is an opportunity for the party
7521212 the mission was basically self deter mina tion for puerto rico and for the neighborhood
7521213 community empowerment and the whole question of puerto rico being a direct colony of the u s
7521214 prior to that no one had really fought back against the daley machine
7521215 a certain element was definitely not interested in dropping the drugs and the violence

7521217 gutierrez is very powerful hell probably harness most of the money but ill run a very grassroots campaign with the community groups soccer leagues churches
7521218 people see gutierrez as a champion of immigrants but the proposals hes put forth are far from that
7521219 i dont see immigration as a problem of national security where you need to militarize the border i see it as a labor issue as long as you criminalize immigrants and ignore their economic contribution youre shooting yourself in the foot
7521220 we are going to stumble on many latinos who will reject the green party because they joined the democratic party in search of privileges a job to be elected to a political position even to get some consulting and patronage contracts

7521317 while the web hosting industry does not view social networks as a threat to its business people are going to functional hosts for services that allow them to share information online this demonstrates that there are opportunities for web hosts to tap into consumers who embrace social networks but these opportunities are being overlooked by the very industry that knows the internet best

7521406 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7521407 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7521408 the american lung association is going to add it as a risk factor
7521409 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7521410 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7521411 its a population based study which means that you can make an association but not necessarily a conclusion
7521412 it probably promotes more work in the area of routine household items and things we need to be looking at more prospectively to make a clear cause and effect relationship
7521413 anything that affects air quality negatively is not a good thing

7521501 im very sad to see a building which i together with some musicians fought so hard to acquire for the union now turned into a chop bar
7521502 in nigeria when some musicians were facing similar problems they formed their own professional union and is now the biggest union so far so there is no big deal in forming ours because its going to be the biggest union ever in the history of the music industry
7521503 it is as a result these problems and many others that the young artistes in the industry mess up with their work they dont go through any form of workshops and training things the union is supposed to be organising that is why they choose anybody at all who expresses willingness to assist them as their producers and managers
7521504 the union is in total sham and i really pity these young ones who are coming into the system because if they are not strong and hard working like me and some few others they will go hungry

7521540 and the banks need to change their people for example many banks made huge investments in crm thats the easy part the technology what they really need to do is change their people by taking all the inefficiencies and non value added services and processes from the branch so that tellers can listen to the customers once transaction oriented tellers start to listen they ask questions and these questions bring opportunities for the bank
7521541 you want to move from being transaction driven to a cross selling channel so banks need to try to reengineer their operations by taking out the waste
7521542 you have to change the behaviors culture and processes and keep tweaking
7521543 it might even mean having to let go or reassign some branch managers because they dont have the skills set to operate like this
7521544 these tools can increase sales by allowing the bank to set targets on things like quality or how quickly a loan is opened youre getting your people to perform against key performance indicators youre holding them accountable

7521558 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations
7521559 exploit his background to argue that an apostate is leading the global war on terror to galvanize sympathizers into action

7521565 you just told me a pregnancy should always come to term if possible where is your commitment
7521566 were very disappointed that our logo and brand position were used in that way
7521567 hey im interested in what obama and biden have to say
7521568 abc news sara just reports journalists who were awake until the wee hours waiting for confirmation that sen joe biden d del was indeed barack obamas running mate cannot be blamed if their hearing is a little fuzzy today but after todays obama biden speeches to a massive crowd in springfield ill many reporters are rolling back the tape and asking each other did he really say that when introducing his running mate obama said so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the us of america joe biden and then when it was bidens turn to speak the delaware senator called the presumptive democratic nominee barack america instead of barack obama

7521570 pennsylvania is well known for its vast amount of puppy mills and people brought so many of those dogs in to us but the mills kept going to be able to see one of those close down instead of just taking dogs theyve sold has been a dream come true for me
7521571 the dogs pelvis is not broken the bad news is it is paralyzed in the rear legs the good news is one of the organizations here best friends animal society has committed to taking care of that dog for the rest of its life
7521572 the dog has been in this condition for some time
7521573 they dont know how to walk in grass they get in it and they feel this strange sensation on their feet and they will stumble and fall over you literally have to teach them to walk on grass
7521574 these dogs have had very little human attention they fight for it dogs from puppy mills typically dont do well with other dogs these dogs have never been on a leash they have seen so many more people in the last 24 hours than they have seen in their entire lives
7521575 if you cant see where the dog was born and raised you simply shouldnt be buying that dog
7521576 now it is time to get busy electing the team
7521577 i am disappointed in some ways but my reality check is that this is the process and sen obama has been through the process and is the victor it is time to let bygones be bygones
7521578 i know several individuals who are saddened over sen clintons loss but i hope we can get past that and realize how important it is we elect sen obama to bring about change
7521579 im excited to be here and to hear the speeches of our leading democrats
7521580 i think theres quite a contrast between joe biden and john mccain i like biden hes a real person who understands middle class and working families
7521581 the 19th amendment was ratified on aug 26 1920 and the league started a couple of days before so both are turning 88
7521582 theres an important election coming up and we want everyone to be able to exercise their choice and to be heard on nov 4
7521583 voters have to be registered at least 30 days prior to the election
7521584 we hope women and men will drop by anytime tuesday and register
7521585 well also serve refreshments to celebrate this day that women finally won the right to vote
7521586 over time there have been many factors that contributed to the progress women have made in the united states most social historians will argue that the single most important factor was acquiring and exercising the right to vote
7521587 the struggle for equality is an ongoing and often painfully frustrating process but the right to express oneself through the promise and the power of a single vote is the first step in becoming an active and equal participant in the social life of the country
7521588 young people can register too if they turn 18 before nov 4
7521589 its a little bit too hot but otherwise its a good day for a ride

7521600 there is a profound and mysterious relationship between music and hope between song and eternal life
7521601 it is no coincidence that christian tradition shows the spirits of the blessed as they sing in chorus captivated and enraptured by the beauty of god
7521602 reminds us furthermore of the value and the universal importance of artistic heritage
7521603 in order to build a world founded on justice and solidarity putting the multiform expressions of world culture to good account at the service of mankind
7521604 educating people to recognize true beauty has for the formation of the young
7521605 contributes to refining their souls and leads towards the construction of a society open to the ideals of the spirit

7521627 those competitions are prestigious but they dont offer the same combination of great food in a fun atmosphere served by all american hooters girls
7521628 the hooters competition presents a problem with so many variables it is taxing the best mathematical minds of our generation

7521672 das setzt allerdings voraus dass der waffenstillstand eingehalten wird alle konfliktparteien dem zustimmen und der un sicherheitsrat ein entsprechendes mandat erteilt
7521673 es war v llig neben der sache denn die raketenabwehr ist nicht gegen russland gerichtet
7521674 denn georgien ist das transitland auf das europa angewiesen ist wenn es auch l und gas ber pipelines aus zentralasien bekommen will ohne dass diese pipelines durch russische territorien verlaufen
7521675 die finanzindustrie ist eine zukunftsbranche und von zentraler bedeutung f r die hessische wirtschaft der anteil der menschen die im kredit und versicherungsgewerbe arbeiten ist in hessen ann hernd doppelt so hoch wie im gesamten bundesgebiet wir haben bereits heute zahlreiche initiativen die jede f r sich genommen gute und richtige ans tze verfolgt diese aktivit ten wollen wir st rker b ndeln um noch mehr durchschlagskraft zu erzielen immerhin konkurrieren wir mit standorten an denen das marketing zentral gef hrt wird
7521676 frankfurt steht zwar f r weit mehr als finanzen doch die finanzbranche bildet das zentrum eines dicht gewobenen clusters wissensintensiver dienstleistungen dieses cluster tr gt ganz erheblich zur dynamik des wirtschaftsraums bei
7521677 die wissensintensiven dienstleistungen gruppieren sich um 234 banken die ihren sitz in frankfurt haben aus diesem netz erw chst eine wirtschaftskraft die wir mit frankfurt main finance noch besser nutzen und weiter beschleunigen wollen
7521678 wir banken sind ebenso wie unsere dienstleister und partner darauf angewiesen dass qualifizierte mitarbeiter und interessante gesch ftspartner gerne nach frankfurt kommen deshalb haben wir uns in frankfurt main finance zusammengeschlossen um ber unsere eigendarstellung hinaus unter einer starken marke werte wie geradlinigkeit globalit t und ganzheitlichkeit zu verk rpern

7521681 der gedanke einer regionalkonferenz darf durch das konzeptionslose handeln der bundesregierung nicht schaden nehmen sinnvoll ist eine solche konferenz wenn sie durch gespr che mit allen nachbarstaaten vorbereitet wird es bedarf verhandlungen sowohl in russland als auch in georgien in aserbaidschan und armenien sinnvoll ist es ebenfalls die t rkei in eine solche konferenz einzubeziehen schon der umstand dass es zwischen der t rkei und armenien keine diplomatischen beziehungen gibt beweist die notwendigkeit gr ndlicher vorbereitung wer eine nachbarschaftskonferenz dieser gr enordnung auf den weg bringen will muss inhaltliche vorschl ge sowohl f r die konflikte zwischen aserbaidschan und armenien zu nagorny karabach wie auch verhandlungsschritte f r den russland georgien konflikt einbringen dazu liegt von der bundesregierung nichts substanzielles vor ffentlichkeitsarbeit ist eben noch keine diplomatie das gilt auch f r eine inhaltliche auseinandersetzung mit der forderung der russischen duma s dossetien und abchasien als unabh ngige staaten anzuerkennen wer beim kosovo diesen v lkerrechtswidrigen weg eingeschlagen hat dem gehen jetzt die argumente aus um russland davon abzuhalten den gleichen v lkerrechtswidrigen weg zu gehen in der au enpolitik der bundesregierung nehmen doppelte standards und un berlegtes handeln be ngstigenden umfang an starke worte sind noch keine starke politik

7521760 lets say you have three numbers stacked on top of each other in a spreadsheet please write a formula on the board that you would use to add them up ok and if you wanted to average them without deleting the numbers what would you do if you wanted to not show the three rows in which those numbers appear can you explain what the goal seek function does

7521762 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7521763 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7521764 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7521765 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7521766 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7521767 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7521768 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption

7521782 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7521783 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7521784 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really

7521790 this detachment signifies another step forward in re establishing humint in the air force
7521791 this is the first humint unit in the air force since 1995 and our efforts are reintegrating humint into the air force isr arsenal to meet the warfighting requirements
7521792 what has happened in georgia has caused us to step back and to want to look hard at whether russia is really prepared to take a course that would lead it into further integration into the international community
7521793 one that has been cooperative with us in the war on terrorism one that has been cooperative with us in terms of nuclear nonproliferation cooperative in the middle east cooperative on north korea even cooperative on iran
7521794 russia will not be allowed to destabilize europe rice says
7521795 this is behavior that is not consistent with the statement that president medvedev made just a few weeks ago about a modern russia that would gain its respect in the world through its technology and its science and its culture
7521796 you dont gain that through beating up a small neighbor and then not keeping your word to the european presidency
7521797 the more the russians say things like were doing this as peacekeepers the more ridiculous that sounds
7521798 russia is paying a price for what it has done
7521799 but i would certainly hope that russia is also assessing the damage that this has done to its ability to go on the course that president medvedev outlined
7521800 the civilian innocent lives that were taken cannot be brought back it will have destroyed civilian infrastructure which will be rebuilt it will have damaged the georgian military capability which will be rebuilt and it will have undermined its own reputation and credibility and called into question its suitability for the very institutions that it says it wants to be a part of
7521801 i think that the best rebuff to russia will be when georgia reemerges as economically strong and politically strong
7521802 well never be able to describe how honored we feel to be a part of this project
7521803 were just very humbled and want to give our thanks to the hundreds of people who worked on the design team
7521804 were fortunate enough not to have lost anybody on that day
7521805 it was just the atmosphere from that day it was filled with such sorrow and it was such a negative time we just wanted to contribute something positive thats the idea of why we entered the competition
7521806 the design had to be like no other because 9 11 was a day like no other
7521807 we wanted it to capture the magnitude of the events that played out that day
7521808 now that the place is almost open we can begin to digest everything
7521809 its been an intensely positive experience but a lot of hard work all the way around were not sure well ever be able to top this experience or describe how honored we feel about being a part of this
7521810 it was a surprise to me to see how poor the people of the community actually were
7521811 their lack of facilities as well as the generally poor quality of health among the population was astounding but their gratitude toward us providing whatever assistance we could was truly heartwarming
7521812 on our first day the people working in triage brought a 6 year old girl in who was running an extremely high fever and began having a seizure
7521813 we immediately were able to stabilize the girl and upon further examination determined both her and her 7 year old sister had scarlet fever two days later the girls mother returned to show us how much her daughters conditions had improved and that they no longer had fevers
7521814 this woman knew she had cancer but couldnt afford treatment and when she came in there was nothing we could do because she had already progressed to stage three
7521815 it was surprising to me that we were able to help as many people as we did with a relatively small team
7521816 i think we really made a difference for these people and im glad we were able to help
7521817 after september 11th the nation looked at these great americans and said who shall we send
7521818 this nation is so well served by all of you and i am honored to stand here among you
7521819 students from across the nation know that when they come to purdue they will receive a quality education due to the outstanding work of our faculty and staff
7521820 purdue continues to add tremendous value to the lives of our graduates as they enter the work force well prepared and ready to meet the challenges of a global marketplace
7521821 purdues college of engineering continues to rank among the top institutions in the country thanks to the dedication of the faculty staff alumni and corporate partners
7521822 the top 10 ranking of our undergraduate program reflects purdue engineerings longstanding commitment to undergraduate education
7521823 we are extremely pleased to have moved up four spots in the u s news undergraduate business rankings
7521824 our position as a top 20 program overall and top 10 program among public universities is a reflection of our continued emphasis on the undergraduate program at the krannert school it speaks highly of the quality of our faculty staff students and alumni in this very competitive marketplace
7521825 we also are delighted that our production operations management ranking one of the hallmarks of our school rose a spot to second behind only mit while quantitative analysis remained firmly in the top five
7521826 our sole purpose is to be the eyes for the aircraft so they can be forewarned if another aircraft is in their vicinity friend or foe
7521827 the greatest thing that we get from the exercise is the fact that we get face to face brief and debrief opportunities with one another something that we normally do not get between ourselves and awacs crews
7521828 its really great to work with people from different places
7521829 the crew learns something new with every place we go
7521830 the integration of our two systems is integral in our missions and the more we are able to take from each occasion that we work together the better we are able to execute our missions with precision
7521831 americas heroes at work really focuses on the employment challenges of our returning veterans from the war on terror if they are living with a brain injury or living with a stress disorder
7521832 we know that a number of our servicemembers are coming back with some level of brain injury as a result of blast injuries or successive blast injuries or may be coming back with stress
7521833 we know its a significant enough issue that we want to pay some serious attention to it
7521834 employment plays absolutely a major role in the rehabilitation of our servicemembers regardless of the kind of injuries that they may have
7521835 esto somos y aqu estamos la ciudad un dia ser nuestra pero hoy gritemos cantemos convivamos porque jovenes somos muchos pero la juventud es solamente una
7521836 we believe our participation in this project is in line with our strategy of expanding into downstream applications of pv technology and will further strengthen our vertical integration business model
7521837 we are continuing to pursue cost effective solar and other renewable opportunities aggressively and we expect to announce additional renewable energy investments soon
7521838 by converting plant mitchell to biomass we hope to not only help grow the renewable resource base in georgia but also to expand the market for renewable energy credits which ultimately will foster additional renewable energy development
7521839 georgia power is taking an important step toward continued diversification of its fuel sources and making renewable energy more affordable for customers
7521840 this project will help gm reduce costs while serving as a clean renewable energy source through innovation and commitment gm is making a significant positive impact on the environmental issues facing our world
7521841 this project will help gm reduce costs while serving as a clean renewable energy source
7521842 through innovation and commitment gm is making a significant positive impact on the environmental issues facing our world
7521843 harnessing the natural and abundant power of the sun and cost effectively converting it into energy is an important component of our comprehensive strategy to commercialize and deploy advanced clean alternative technologies to enhance our energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
7521844 our investment in these grid integration projects will lay the groundwork for high levels of solar photovoltaic market penetration to help meet the presidents goal of making solar power cost competitive with conventional sources of electricity
7521845 we suggest that peoples willingness to take psychological enhancements will largely depend on beliefs about whether those enhancements will alter characteristics considered fundamental to self identity
7521846 together this research converges to highlight the importance of identity expression and preservation in governing the choices and lives of consumers
7521847 interestingly one group that over consumes the mini packs is chronic dieters individuals constantly trying to manage their weight and food intake
7521848 on the one hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be a generous portion of food numerous small food morsels in each pack and multiple mini packs in each box on the other hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be diet food for chronic dieters this perceptual dilemma causes a tendency to overeat due to their emotion laden relationship with food
7521849 while restrained eaters may be attracted to smaller foods in smaller packages initially presumably because these products are thought to help consumers with their diets our research shows that restrained eaters actually tend to consume more of these foods than they would of regular foods
7521850 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
7521851 the increasing availability of single serve and multi packs may not serve consumers in the long run but because they are considered to be innocent pleasures may turn out to be sneaky small sins
7521852 maybe the answer lies in consumers taking responsibility for their consumption and monitoring internal cues of sufficiency rather than letting package size take control
7521853 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
7521854 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7521855 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7521856 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7521857 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7521858 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

7521901 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
7521902 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
7521903 know that john mccains faith and character were tested and forged in ways few can fathom

7521979 well if you dont want to tell us thats fine but dont lie
7521980 how much did you pay for that tv not as much as you paid for that hideous car
7521981 well you know things dont seem to cost as much since we started selling our kidneys
7521982 yes it was expensive but only a fraction of the twenty million dollars i made last year thank you but if you want to be better mannered here are some approaches you can take
7521983 thanks for asking but id rather not say by the way how did you like that batman movie
7521984 more than i wanted to but it had all the features we needed
7521985 less than i thought i would i got a great deal
7521986 you know ive always felt that money is like religion and politics its better left out of polite conversation

7521993 the chinese would like the world cup but that will not happen before 2022
7521994 suddenly i understood the lawn from a different perspective when i adopted the plants point of view and that was in mowing the lawn were doing exactly what the grass wants us to do without knowing it that those of us who mow lawns are the greatest dupes in nature because what does grass want grass wants what all things want lots of habitat in the case of grass it wants sunlight it wants freedom from the trees
7521995 looking at the case of plants more than animals which are much more on a continuum with us highlights something really important about who we are and what it highlights is that our whole cognitive apparatus our consciousness our tool making these things we pride ourselves on are really just one way of doing business in nature they are the tools weve evolved every species evolves its own tools for getting along in nature none are better or worse or more sophisticated than any other the plants have been evolving longer than we have they just have been going down a different path theyre not interested in consciousness its not that theyre not good at it its that they have something that for their purposes works even better
7521996 we still think were different we still think we are the thinking subject and everything else is inanimate and we can control it so we bring these very factory like ideas to the management of the natural world so we know what darwin told us but we behave as if it was still a machine universe controlled by the great consciousness of humans and taking the plants viewpoint is i think how we begin to overcome that we can begin to finish that darwinian revolution because its one thing to know something and its quite another to have it in your heart which is one reason why artists and writers are an important part of this project its not enough for scientists to tell us things we need to make it stick

7522022 three years later we still have concerned citizens and ngos struggling for transparency in the process of the proposed developments at ta cenc it is a pity that the government and the gozo ministry still seem to be unaware of the ecological ornithological and geomorphologic uniqueness of ta cenc it is extremely disappointing that notwithstanding the echoing of the eco gozo project the ministry for gozo still finds it hard to express a simple opinion on this issue
7522023 it is absolutely unacceptable that the ta cenc site home to various birds endemic species and historical remains has not been included in the list of protected sites ta cenc is a place of unique importance not only because of its special bio diversity but also because the natural beauty of the place with its unique diversity it is a source of attraction for maltese and tourists and thus a source of much needed income for the local economy

7522042 what i feel is missing from our screens is a channel that encourages adventurism and experimentation backed by money
7522043 a channel that becomes home of the best programme makers the best writers the best directors and most visionary producers and format creators a channel that becomes a brand for what is new and surprising but not compromised by the pressures of advertising or too tightly targeted an audience
7522044 uninhibited by the need to placate advertisers the subscription networks have been given the opportunity to experiment but on a big rather than timid scale
7522045 whatever the bbc says and does it will get it in the neck
7522046 lets take a wager that the bbc brand is the best tv brand in the world that people will pay for that brand
7522047 let it hold on to all of its free channels and radio stations but let it also build a new subscription service that will provide the very best in what the british television industry the best in the world can do
7522048 theres too much at stake too vital a contribution to our culture to let its critics start to pull it apart now i want it to fight back with all the energy and resources it has more specifically i want it to plug a gap i still see in the british tv market one which once filled can give the individual programme maker the impetus to make the distinctive the surprising the lavish the intimate the experimental unhampered by the constraints the bbc normally has to operate under

7522061 beri aku sebuah hadits yang kamu dengar dari rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam yang tidak kamu sandarkan kepada seorang pun selain beliau
7522062 aku mendengar seruan orang yang berseru penyeru rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menyeru ash shalatu jamiah
7522063 pada hari datangnya sebagian tanda tanda rabb mu tidaklah bermanfaat lagi iman seseorang bagi dirinya sendiri yang belum beriman sebelum itu atau dia belum mengusahakan kebaikan dalam masa imannya katakanlah tunggulah oleh kalian sesungguhnya kamipun menunggu pula
7522064 pada hari datangnya sebagian dari tanda tanda kekuasaan rabbmu yang merupakan kejadian yang luar biasa yang dengannya diketahui bahwa kehancuran telah demikian dekat dan kiamat tidak lama lagi
7522065 maka tatkala mereka melihat adzab kami mereka berkata kami beriman hanya kepada allah saja dan kami kafir kepada sembahan sembahan yang telah kami persekutukan dengan allah maka iman mereka tiada berguna bagi mereka tatkala mereka telah melihat siksa kami itulah sunnah allah yang telah berlaku atas hamba hamba nya dan di waktu itu binasalah orang orang kafir
7522066 para ulama berkata tidak bermanfaatnya keimanan seseorang di kala terbitnya matahari dari tempat terbenamnya karena telah masuk ke dalam hati mereka perasaan takut yang melenyapkan setiap syahwat hawa nafsunya dan melemahkan setiap kekuatan dari kekuatan tubuhnya
7522067 sesungguhnya allah subhanahu wa taala menerima taubat seorang hamba selama nyawa belum sampai ke tenggorokan
7522068 jika seorang kafir menampakkan keimanannya pada saat itu maka tidak diterima darinya adapun bila dia seorang mukmin sebelum hari itu jika dia baik dalam beramal maka dia dalam kebaikan yang besar namun jika dia mengotori imannya lalu dia bertaubat saat itu maka tidak diterima taubatnya
7522069 ada tiga perkara yang jika telah muncul maka tidak bermanfaat keimanan seseorang yang tidak beriman sebelum munculnya atau dalam keimanannya tidak membuahkan kebaikan terbitnya matahari dari tempat terbenamnya munculnya dajjal dan keluarnya daabbah binatang melata yang berdialog dengan manusia dan memberitakan kepada mereka akan dekatnya hari kiamat
7522070 tidak tegak hari kiamat hingga matahari terbit dari tempat terbenamnya apabila telah terbit demikian dan manusia telah melihatnya maka merekapun beriman dan itu merupakan hari yang tidak bermanfaat keimanan bagi satu jiwa yang dia tidak beriman sebelumnya atau tidak menghasilkan kebaikan pada keimanannya
7522071 bahwa allah subhanahu wa taala membuat sebuah pintu taubat di sebelah barat yang luasnya sejarak perjalanan 70 tahun yang tidak akan ditutup selama matahari belum terbit dari tempat tersebut dan itulah maksud dari firman allah subhanahu wa taala
7522072 sesungguhnya dia pergi ke tempat menetapnya di bawah arsy lalu dia merendahkan diri sambil sujud senantiasa dia dalam keadaan demikian hingga dikatakan kepadanya terbitlah dari tempat yang engkau kehendaki dia pun terbit dari tempat biasanya terbit lalu dia terus berjalan dalam keadaan manusia tidak terkejut sedikit pun akan hal itu sampai dia kembali berhenti lalu merendahkan diri sambil sujud di tempat menetapnya di bawah arsy dan manusia tidak terkejut sedikit pun dari hal itu lalu dikatakan kepadanya terbitlah dari tempat terbenammu lalu terbitlah dia dari tempat terbenamnya
7522073 itu adalah hari yang tidak bermanfaat keimanan bagi satu jiwa yang tidak beriman sebelumnya atau keimanan yang padanya tidak menghasilkan kebaikan
7522074 ini merupakan riwayat riwayat yang saling menguatkan yang sepakat menunjukkan bahwa jika matahari terbit dari tempat terbenamnya tertutuplah pintu taubat dan tidak terbuka lagi dan hal tersebut tidak dikhususkan pada saat hari terbitnya dari tempat terbenamnya saja namun terus berlanjut hingga hari kiamat
7522075 wahai sekalian manusia sesungguhnya rajam itu benar maka janganlah kalian tertipu dan hujjah yang menunjukkan hal tersebut bahwa rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah menegakkan rajam dan abu bakr pun telah merajam dan sesungguhnya kami pun telah melaksanakan rajam setelah mereka berdua dan akan muncul satu kaum dari kalangan umat ini yang akan mendustakan rajam mendustakan dajjal mendustakan terbitnya matahari dari tempat terbenamnya mendustakan adanya siksa kubur mendustakan syafaat mendustakan kaum yang keluar dari neraka setelah mereka hangus terbakar
7522076 seluruh khawarij dan mutazilah mendustakan enam perkara ini sedangkan ahlus sunnah membenarkannya dan merekalah al jamaah serta hujjah membantah orang orang yang menyelisihi ahlus sunnah
7522077 hadits ini diriwayatkan oleh dua syaikh al bukhari dan muslim dari berbagai jalan dari ibrahim bin yazid bin syarik dari abu dzar dan dia walaupun di tsiqah kan oleh segolongan orang adalah mudallis al imam ahmad rahimahullahu berkata dia tidak bertemu abu dzar seperti yang dikatakan ad daruquthni rahimahullahu dia tidak mendengar dari hafshah dan aisyah dan tidak menjumpai zaman keduanya dan seperti yang disebutkan oleh ibnul madini rahimahullahu dia tidak mendengar dari ali dan ibnu abbas radhiyallahu anhuma hal itu disebutkan dalam tahdzib at tahdzib dan telah diriwayatkan selain riwayat ini dari para sahabat dengan cara ananah1 sehingga ada kemungkinan yang memberitakan kepadanya dari mereka adalah orang yang tidak terpercaya maka jika pada sebagian riwayat shahihain dan kitab kitab sunan berpenyakit seperti ini ditambah lagi ada kemungkinan dimasuki kisah israiliyat dan kekeliruan penukilan secara makna lalu bagaimana lagi dengan riwayat riwayat yang ditinggalkan oleh dua syaikh al bukhari dan muslim dan yang ditinggalkan oleh periwayat kitab kitab sunan
7522078 dari ibrahim bin yazid at taimi bahwa dia mendengar sebagaimana yang aku ketahui dari ayahnya dari abu dzar
7522079 pada perkataan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam tempat menetapnya di bawah arsy kita tidak mengingkari bahwa matahari memiliki tempat menetap di bawah arsy dari sisi yang kita tidak mampu menjangkaunya tidak bisa kita saksikan dan sesungguhnya bila kita dikabarkan tentang perkara ghaib maka kita tidak mendustakannya dan tidak menanyakan bagaimana sebab ilmu kita tidak mampu menjangkaunya
7522080 adapun tentang sujudnya matahari itu adalah sebuah jangkauan ilmu yang allah subhanahu wa taala telah ciptakan padanya
7522081 my religious beliefs and confidence in my ability to do the job whatever it might be have always guided me
7522082 i have always had faith in god to get me through whatever comes my way
7522083 what can you say when you have a disease that claims within one year 75 percent of those who are hit with it you try to be optimistic and think you are going to be in the other 25 percent those who survive for maybe two years but you also have to face reality
7522084 i am totally comfortable with where i am and what might lie ahead
7522085 trying to learn what causes this disease and how to prevent looking for better ways to diagnose and treat it
7522086 if my part in the research is meaningful if what im doing can help find a breakthrough thats fine
7522087 im fully aware of the acs american cancer society statistics and my chances of surviving ive told the doctors to tell me what to do and ill do it i dont have false hopes im realistic about everything but im not giving up
7522088 i just want to get them to start thinking and talking about religion make religion a part of their lives
7522089 theres an old hungarian saying that boys follow the father and girls follow the mother i was fortunate to learn both religions i attended calvin united presbyterian church in brownsville in catechism as well as everything else i learned it was reinforced twice with two languages i learned everything in english and then again in hungarian in fact i could speak hungarian before i could speak english
7522090 his philosophy was we all worship the same god we just use different approaches ive never forgotten those words and have tried to follow his advice anytime im at the pulpit
7522091 he knew i had done sermons a few times at other churches in the area and that i had public speaking experience with the state police
7522092 they knew i was a police officer and probably wondered what the heck is this guy doing behind the pulpit
7522093 but i speak from the heart and try to use thoughts and themes to which the congregation can relate
7522094 bob never went to church although his wife was a member of the congregation she and their friends tried to convince him to go to hear mr kara he will change your life he insisted he would never set foot in church but he finally relented and did a complete turnaround he became a deacon and an elder of the church and tells everyone that rich brought me to jesus he regularly calls to check on rich and sends the most beautiful cards
7522095 whatever happens we see this experience as gods way of using rich as an example of courage and faith to the many people whose lives he has touched i firmly believe hes not done
7522096 his courage and strength gives hope to all who love and respect him
7522097 its comforting to know that im in the hands of the best doctors nurses and staff at hillman
7522098 they do everything there the mri the blood work etc
7522099 as hard as it is joey made me feel really comfortable doing the show
7522100 i havent danced in 60 years i want to get my muscles back theyre noodles i need the exercise this is the most pleasant way to do it
7522101 im more worried about this than i was during the 100 meter finals
7522102 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity im a big fan of the show i never thought i had the guts to do it but im going to go for it
7522103 as hard as it is joey made me feel really comfortable doing the show
7522104 we get tons of calls but as much as people think the show casts itself it gets more difficult its become a year round job
7522105 ive known him for a long time hes been a really very supportive committee chair and before that ranking chair for the state department and for our diplomatic efforts
7522106 c ampaign advisers said sunday that they were certain mr biden would spend considerable time campaigning through election day in four swing states florida michigan ohio and pennsylvania
7522107 a task for mr biden the advisers said will be to doggedly portray the presumptive republican nominee as a handmaiden for president bush who would continue his policies in the words of one adviser mr biden can be an artful critic because he knows chapter and verse about mr mccains senate votes and controversial positions after serving with him for two decades
7522108 maybe part of the reason he was so attracted to chicago and his wife michelle was that sense of rootedness he elected to make a choice whereas mom sort of wandered through the world collecting treasures
7522109 for the illinois senator cool can be complicated it helps him maintain composure as he bursts through the barriers of race and politics it also creates about him an aura of detachment it fuels his boldness as well as his caution the inspiration and the calculation the intelligence and the ambition that will make him this week the first black presidential nominee of a major u s party
7522110 obama so far has picked his battles carefully choosing most often to focus on winning converts
7522111 oxy as it is affectionately known nurtured his transformation he started playing basketball less so he could read and study more after shying away from activism early in his college career he joined an antiapartheid campaign he came to terms with his identity eventually ditching his nickname barry and embracing barack and then yearning for a bigger stage he engineered a transfer to columbia
7522112 we have a high degree of confidence of how the roll call vote
7522113 at the same time acknowledging persistent unease with mr obama among a significant segment of voters his aides said they would use speeches and presentations during the next four days including having al gore introduce mr obama for his acceptance speech thursday night to offer a fuller biography and a more detailed plan of what he would do as president
7522114 more than half of the delegates that mrs clinton won in the primaries now say they are enthusiastic supporters of mr obama and they also believe he will win the presidential election in november the poll found three in 10 say they support mr obama but have reservations about him or they support him only because he is the partys nominee five percent say they do not support him yet
7522115 t he most important events of the first days of the convention will center on sen hillary rodham clinton and her supporters the senator from new york won 18 million votes in her nomination battle with obama and the enthusiastic support of her followers is critical to obamas hopes of winning in november she will speak tuesday night but her message at events behind the scenes may be just as important
7522116 in an important shift democratic officials confirmed sunday that clinton will release her delegates to obama at a reception on wednesday clintons gesture has the potential to reduce the appearance of friction while reinforcing her status as one of the partys most formidable power brokers
7522117 the former president is disappointed associates said because he is eager to speak about the economy and more broadly about democratic ideas emphasizing the contrast between the bush years and his own record in the 1990s this is an especially sore point for bill clinton people close to him say because among many grievances he has about the campaign obama waged against his wife is a belief that the candidate poor mouthed the political and policy successes of his two terms
7522118 some senior democrats close to obama meanwhile made clear in not for attribution comments that they were equally irked at the clinton operation nearly three months after hillary clinton conceded defeat in the nomination contest these obama partisans complained her team continues to act like she and bill clinton hold leverage
7522119 after tapping veteran democratic strategist stephanie cutter as her chief of staff in june michelle obama 44 has softened her image by appearing on television programs such as the view
7522120 if part of her function has been to reveal the husband and dad side of the man addressing the masses she also needs to show shes just a woman just an american just a patriot in the primaries she was dubbed the closer for her ability to persuade the undecided voters walking in to come on board before walking out now shes the opener the first night star called upon to testify about her husbands vision and values and perhaps settle some doubts about herself
7522121 the senator has recently told people that he has a speech written for the convention and that he badly wants to come pending a final medical consultation
7522122 buzz has built among massachusetts politicos that kennedy would come and yesterday a bay state democrat close to the family confirmed that kennedy has decided to travel to denver probably for an opening night address
7522123 a lieberman pick should help with ticket splitters but can such a ticket hold the support of pro lifers conservatives and republicans if youre conscientiously pro life you will have reservations about a pro abortion rights v p if youre a proud conservative lieberman hasnt been one if youre a loyal republican youd much prefer someone from within the ranks but if youre pro life conservative and or republican you certainly dont want barack obama joe biden nancy pelosi and harry reid running the country if a mccain lieberman ticket is the best way to thwart that prospect you could probably learn to live with it even perhaps to like it
7522124 thus the mccain campaign has raised the question would mccain want to pick a vice presidential candidate who was perhaps his toughest critic in the primaries former massachusetts governor mitt romney if mccain picks romney the democrats doubtless would remind voters of the mccain romney feud
7522125 obamas choice of joe biden as a running mate sets the bar for john mccain
7522126 the republican could use his own pugnacious no 2 to deliver attack lines and a solid debate performance
7522127 she had the experience and judgment to be president now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its okay really
7522128 in terms of global warming there is not a bigger picture than the diagnosis and monitoring of ocean heat content changes
7522129 a question for you is when will you be posting upper ocean heat content anomaly maps and long term trends in near real time this would substantially elevate the scientific discussion of global warming
7522130 my question to you is what would have to occur in terms of the accumulation of upper ocean heat content for you to reject the ipcc climate model predictions of global warming for instance what accumulation in joules must the upper ocean have for the 10 year period starting in 2004 for you to not reject the model predictions of this quantity

7522160 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
7522161 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7522162 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7522163 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7522164 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7522165 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

7522216 notre calendrier en championnat tait tr s charg pendant plus dun mois nous avons d jouer tous les trois jours mais nous avons eu du temps pour nous pr parer pour le match de monaco ce sera plus facile psychologiquement car en championnat les fans nattendent que des victoires il y a plus de pression
7522217 apr s leuro 2008 les internationaux sont rentr s tr s fatigu s et nous avons eu un calendrier difficile en championnat la saga du transfert dandrei arshavin prend bien trop de temps en fin de compte personne ne nous voyait si forts mais les choses seront d sormais plus difficiles pour nous

7522223 tell me about one fun thing you did this summer
7522224 my brother and went sailing last weekend it was quite an adventure we ended up ship wrecked on an island just this side of gimili our boat drifted ashore and we decided to stop for lunch it was a beautiful sunny afternoon so we took our picnic lunch out of the boat and headed to the beach for a little r amp r
7522225 i had barely pulled out the plates napkins and silk flowers when i sensed someone else was on the island as soon as the checkered table cloth hit the sand we had trouble pigs were everywhere i was sure they smelled our peanut butter amp banana sandwiches the snorted and snickered as they made way out of the woods i held on tight to our monster cookies i was worried that even our juice boxes were in danger
7522226 so we decided the only way we could possibly make out okay was to confront them
7522227 im so happy youre you had a great day kids hope youre hungry were having pork chops for dinner

7522264 many women as well as men believe that aging skin is inevitable but with the information and technologies we have today you really can look as young as you feel
7522265 sleep lines wrinkles that become etched into the surface of the skin and dont disappear once youre up sleeping on your side increases wrinkles on cheeks and chin while sleeping face down gives you a furrowed brow to reduce wrinkle formation the aad says sleep on your back
7522266 women especially are so concerned with antiaging products they often overlook the power of a simple moisturizer skin that is moist simply looks better so lines and creases are far less noticeable
7522267 a debate is a conflict which clarifies a position a dialogue is a conversation which compromises a position
7522268 a debate is a conflict which clarifies a position a dialogue is a conversation which compromises a position
7522269 from fundamentalism in its repudiation of separatism and its determination to engage itself in the theological dialogue of the day
7522270 the body of christ in all its diversity is created with baptist feet charismatic hands and catholic ears all with their eyes on jesus
7522271 i do not suggest that we should give up trying to seek visible unity nor that we refuse to dialogue with roman catholic laypeople and theologians many of whom may be our brothers and sisters
7522272 how can protestants roman catholics and eastern orthodox christians talk to each other so as together to speak with christs mind to the modern world
7522273 is there not the possibility that evangelicals have not only much to contribute but something to receive through ecumenical involvement do evangelicals not also have the obligation along with other christians to seek to overcome the scandal of the disunity and disobedience of the churches that the world might believe john 17 21 should evangelicals not seek to receive all who confess jesus christ as lord even though they may seriously disagree on theological issues apart from the core of the gospel
7522274 although some came with predetermined agenda many came to listen and learn
7522275 how wide the divide a mormon and an evangelical in conversation
7522276 a formal declaration of repentance for prejudice against members of the church of latter day saints
7522277 to build greater dialogue between evangelical christians and latter day saints
7522278 let me state it clearly we evangelicals have sinned against you we have demonized you
7522279 i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine
7522280 new evangelicalism is characterized by exalting love and unity above doctrine
7522281 cease throwing our theological rocks and start loving as christ commanded us
7522282 o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord
7522283 and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in wickedness
7522284 let me listen carefully and make sure i understand you
7522285 and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus
7522286 paul how do you think we are ever going to have a good dialogue if you persist in talking like that dont you understand the need for christian unity why are you so harsh and judgmental
7522287 listening which at its best includes restating what the other is saying to his complete satisfaction
7522288 i feel i belong to all the churches im equally at home in an anglican or baptist or a brethren assembly or a roman catholic church and the bishops and archbishops and the pope are our friends
7522289 to say they are not christians man alive anybody that receives jesus christ as their lord and saviour is converted theyre born again i believe the pope is a converted man i believe a lot of these wonderful catholics are christians
7522290 we should find ecumenical space for followers of other faiths in salvation christians should stop thinking of christianity as the religion among religions
7522291 you preach your faith but dont play down others i am not going to condemn the hindu or the muslim for his faith
7522292 at no point was there any give in roman doctrine
7522293 the vatican delayed its response until 1991 and then instead of thankful consent it required that the catholic teaching especially on the eucharist the mass be spelt out specifically
7522294 under the species of bread and wine these earthly realities are changed into the reality of his body and blood soul and divinity
7522295 but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth being condemned of himself
7522296 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it
7522297 its hard to make room for what is no longer there
7522298 het is leuk om met een vriend samen te werken maar oh dat was ik even vergeten jij weet niet wat dat is

7522301 borders doesnt this have something to do with the schwengen zone once youre in the zone travel between countries is easier yes we should have something like that with canada
7522302 taking the side roads when the autobahn in austria wants to go through a 20km tunnel what views some of the tunnels dont seem to bypass anything they must be there to keep snow off the roads and highway noise away from the rural settings pretty expensive way to do that though
7522303 in particular over 7 for gasoline and they take it in stride they use a lot more transit all over europe of course and drive a lot more tiny cars that are much better on fuel i rented a toyota yaris which actually was quite suitable except climbing some hills in the alps they need to start selling more cars like it in the usa if just for parking
7522304 most of the old towns had complex regulations about who could drive in and when as such it could not be expressed in international road signs making it very confusing for tourists and these old towns are the main tourist targets who come in cars bring a good translation guide to try to understand where you can stop or park im not demanding everybody speak english of course but in tourist areas a special effort is worthwhile
7522305 germans for some time have been huge consumers of bottled mineral water usually fizzy
7522306 like many other countries a hotel room for 2 is much more than a room for 1 which is i guess good for the single traveller and bad for the couple of course one main reason is that almost always a room comes with a fairly nice breakfast some hotels list their double price some list a per person price for a double making it harder to compare
7522307 lewis and nicole are getting pretty serious theyre almost living in each others pockets as it is but were hearing that they may be about to buy a place together it would only be a part time base because lewis is based in switzerland

7522330 this is another instrumental song i wrote with dave young terror syndrome guitarist the song itself is twisted and progressive with a tinge of heaviness i didnt want to write an album that was straight out metal the whole way through i wanted an album that had diversity and some cool musicianship with great players rusty trombone delivers in every way alex skolnick and trevor dunn are un fucking believable on this song trevor s bass playing is exactly what i pictured it to be ultra creative tasteful and plainly awesome this song was written with trevor in mind he informed me that he used his alembic five string bass from his mr bungle days when he recorded his part which i thought was pretty fucking cool alex skolnick s guest appearance is completely sick as well the mid guitar solo section was written heavier for alex so he could shred his metal roots and the very end of the song alex contributes an awesome bebop jazz solo yes jazz solo alex has been playing jazz for many many years and i wanted him to show off his jazz side in the same song like i said this song is twisted overall rusty trombone delivered in every way i pictured it to its diverse twisted creative and tasteful with some heaviness
7522331 we feel at the moment a better feel for future direction will come from watching the dollar as opposed to looking at oil charts
7522332 last thursdays move was a test for the bulls and whether they wanted to buy it we got our answer they didnt
7522333 in the process of trading up and down dramatically last week it has become clear that only one factor really matters right now thats the dollar
7522334 all the talk about higher costs of production costs of alternative energy sources opec feelings about prices and even refinery utilization now seem to be secondary
7522335 while the conflict is portrayed as the new cold war we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7522336 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort even iran has not stopped its export of crude oil to leverage itself out of a difficult situation and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries that are anyway not that united on the steps to be taken
7522337 hence we could be facing a low volume trading week and in such an environment it will take very strong conviction to break out of the confirmed 112 122 a barrel trading range
7522338 a larger share in the local dairy market would make it easier for national foods to pass on higher costs to product prices

7522350 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
7522351 theyll never make it in to the history book thats just where rich people end up
7522352 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
7522353 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
7522354 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
7522355 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
7522356 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
7522357 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
7522358 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
7522359 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
7522360 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
7522361 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
7522362 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
7522363 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
7522364 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
7522365 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
7522366 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
7522367 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
7522368 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
7522369 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
7522370 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
7522371 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
7522372 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
7522373 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
7522374 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
7522375 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
7522376 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
7522377 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
7522378 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
7522379 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
7522380 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
7522381 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets

7522393 drop in by and see us sundays at the market
7522394 no matter how some democrats though still not the majority might like obama hillary clinton and joe biden just to pick two ought to be given a serious look because they are serious experienced public policy leaders if only our media was as serious
7522395 a joe biden appearance on a sunday morning news show has more poetry than this
7522396 bidens worst mistake was overestimating the ability of the bush administration to carry out the iraq war and underestimating its incompetence or something so joe you want to be the president of the free world and have us place our trust in your ability to judge foreign leaders far more inscrutable than george w bush same for you hillary
7522397 biden continues to be a really smart guy who seems to be just temperamentally off in some way and the idea of making him secretary of state is laughable hes not a diplomat he is a quarterback no doubt about that but not a president
7522398 biden may not be temperamentally suited to be president but hes smart and speaks clearly directly and forcefully he does have a plan many plans in fact
7522399 joe biden is super smart and fun to watch and listen to im not sure he should be president but he should be something
7522400 thats just insane on so many levels my head is spinning too fast to comment further
7522401 pennsylvania gov ed rendell suggests an obama biden ticket i dont think biden could stomach that and it certainly doesnt scream change to put a veteran washington senator on the bill obama would have to choose a plausible outsider
7522402 barack obama picks joe biden as his running mate 5 percent holding steady biden wants to partition iraq
7522403 interesting aside those voting against the fisa bill include not just hillary clinton but john kerry dick durbin and harry reid among others and in the veep watch joe biden and chris dodd neither of whom has a chance to be put on the ticket in my view voted nay evan bayh who i think has a very good chance voted yea
7522404 with the obama campaign keeping us in high suspense today lets take a look at the contenders
7522405 1 joe biden joe biden i happen to be a joe biden fan hes super smart has a great sense of humor and knows foreign countries down to the block level but if you put him on the ticket youll have to spend valuable time and energy cleaning up after him and truthfully he creates a stature gap because hes bigger than obama also the idea of him as secretary of state is a laugh hes not what i would call a diplomat funny though how the pundits who dismissed his presidential run from the get go have suddenly discovered his virtues
7522406 he said i was his love and he was going to get me one way or another

7522415 and the banks need to change their people for example many banks made huge investments in crm thats the easy part the technology what they really need to do is change their people by taking all the inefficiencies and non value added services and processes from the branch so that tellers can listen to the customers once transaction oriented tellers start to listen they ask questions and these questions bring opportunities for the bank
7522416 you want to move from being transaction driven to a cross selling channel so banks need to try to reengineer their operations by taking out the waste
7522417 you have to change the behaviors culture and processes and keep tweaking
7522418 it might even mean having to let go or reassign some branch managers because they dont have the skills set to operate like this
7522419 these tools can increase sales by allowing the bank to set targets on things like quality or how quickly a loan is opened youre getting your people to perform against key performance indicators youre holding them accountable

7522430 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
7522431 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7522432 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats
7522433 the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7522434 you can tell the hillary clinton people they never take the buttons
7522435 i told her i never said that she may have misunderstood
7522436 that was not that was not thats all i have to say
7522437 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7522438 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here

7522452 comparative analysis of nutrients in baby milk using varied milk delivery systems
7522453 handling and storage of breastmilk and formula can impact the levels of vitamin c
7522454 the ability to maintain vitamin c in bottle feeding appears to be influenced by bottle design
7522455 maintaining optimal vitamin c levels over the course of a bottle feeding is of clinical significance to practitioners and parents
7522456 for infants at high risk such as those in neonatal intensive care or with compromised immune systems vitamin c intake should be evaluated bottle shape size and venting should be considered
7522457 nutrition is an important area of study evaluating not only what we eat but how we eat can provide greater understanding of how to achieve optimal nutritional status this is about looking at bottle design and other factors that can influence maintaining optimal nutrition levels of bottle fed milk and formula
7522458 with even a basic understanding of possible differences between bottles moms are armed with useful knowledge to help them make informed choices for their babies

7522462 i may have to do that just based on what we did out there its not about disappointment its about doing whats right and its not about throwing them back out there and putting pads on and scrimmaging for two hours because we did what we did but its a matter of developing just a drive maybe just to go back out there and get back some tempo before we have to get into the season
7522463 there are other things he has to take into consideration the money and his contract with fox but if the giants really want him they have a shot its not out of the question

7522467 we did a lot better as a defense in this last game obviously which was great for us
7522468 our gap discipline was not what it needed to be and we missed a few tackles so we need to clean that up

7522491 prendiamo atto della smentita del ministro gelmini sui corsi intensivi per gli insegnanti del sud ma ora ci dica come intende affrontare i problemi veri della scuola
7522492 e assai grave afferma lombardo che ci si esprima in questi termini razzisti parlando di uomini e donne del sud non necessario scomodare la storia o la letteratura per trovare tra i meridionali figure di straordinario rigore etico ed enorme valore morale e intellettuale
7522493 al di l delle smentite parlano i fatti i tagli apportati in finanziaria fanno presagire il peggio

7522496 la risposta alla domanda di formazione che viene dagli studenti e dalle famiglie oltre che unimpronta professionale al lavoro degli insegnanti sono gli elementi che stanno alla base del rilancio

7522530 when we began rewriting our software as web based applications we wanted an authoring product that was optimized for the web and could provide true single sourcing that product was flare
7522531 we have been using flare since april 2006 and it is one of the best decisions weve made we havent looked back since
7522532 we were jumping into a new world with our software and documentation and it was time to look at a new authoring solution

7523038 liaison between the team and the media that covers us on a daily basis
7523039 we prepare the players and the coaches for press conferences and try to help the media come up with stories about the team
7523040 i think people always want to say that the t o situation was the toughest for us but i dont think it was
7523041 i look back on the 3 13 year in 1998 and we saw coaches let go and that was the toughest thing for me everywhere you turned people werent happy i really base things on wins and losses
7523042 i dont mean to be simple when i say that but i really believe that is the goal of this organization and when you dont win its tough especially in a city like philadelphia because the fans care so much they want to know why when youre not winning and theyre not happy about it and they shouldnt be
7523043 i dont pretend to have any consequences of winning and losing
7523044 i know the media is part of the nfl world especially in philadelphia
7523045 tony had some good blocks and then he had some blocks he needs to work on
7523046 i thought the effort was there i think he continues to need to work on his technique
7523047 we have a long time before that first game so im contemplating on that
7523048 dont you know that 75 percent of the world is covered by water and the other 25 percent is covered by zont
7523049 he was roughed up a bit but hes ok and were happy hes coming home
7523050 jeff said he was slapped around and threatened with them saying do you want your head cut off or do you want to be shot
7523051 all they had to eat was rice and hot water after they fell asleep they were awakened and taken to an interrogation room and it started all over
7523052 they tore up his plane ticket but when they got to the airport they told him to use his credit card to buy a ticket on air china
7523053 he said no and they took his credit card and charged the flight another guy didnt have a credit card or money so they charged his ticket with jeffs credit card
7523054 its a great relief and were happy that hes coming home
7523055 the issues of tibet and freedom of speech in china are still there but it will be nice to have him home so we can work on them together
7523056 its a fine line you walk because the player has to know that the trainer is out for the best for him and at the same time the trainer has to have enough wherewithal to push the guys to get them back out there
7523057 i get in the ice tub but in terms of if i have an injury id rather not go in there if i dont have to
7523058 playoff baseball without the yankees or red sox and with the rays and twins would no doubt scare tv executives and delight thousands of baseball fans sick of watching andy pettitte face jason varitek
7523059 we all know kobe likes to have the ball at the end
7523060 we played with great character in one of the greatest games in international basketball history
7523061 we tried to stop them we couldnt stop them entirely
7523062 we wanted you to bring all your egos because thats how you get better
7523063 what you saw today is a team everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant
7523064 to prepare as much as you can and watch a lot of video especially their bullpen guys
7523065 god forbid if someone gets hurt you have to be ready to go in right away you have to be ready at any moment other than that the secret to pinch hitting is that it has to be something you want to do
7523066 on a club thats in a playoff race and they have enough respect to call me up
7523067 i want to do what i need to do to get back on the field and keep my condition where it is
7523068 i was frustrated more than anything i wanted to finish up that last little bit of action with the first team out there and get off the field make another play it was frustrating in that respect
7523069 i didnt pay attention to it until you say something about it
7523070 when you have an ankle twist or sprain thats part of the game
7523071 i like to put myself in tough situations in practice so that when game time comes hopefully the game is a lot slower than it is
7523072 ive been rotating from free to strong safety as camps been going on and i knew id have the opportunity to play both and i feel prepared to play free safety so its an opportunity for me to get out there more
7523073 each position has its own techniques and variables you have to master
7523074 if youre going to be a strong safety one week and a free safety the next there are a few things you have to refresh in your mind its not that big a deal
7523075 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7523076 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7523077 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7523078 its definitely different because you want to do something special
7523079 instead of just proving yourself for your own sake you want to prove yourself as a member of the olympic team that you deserve to be among all these other great athletes
7523080 im not good with that ill go home and try to hang out but im not very good with that thats the only time i probably take stuff home
7523081 even when you win games you try to be very critical on it and get it right
7523082 because theres a lot of stuff to get on right away
7523083 sometimes i dont even want to get out of bed
7523084 your backs hurting your knees hurting your shoulders hurting your heads hurting its pretty tough
7523085 when you get beat up and then go lift weights it makes your body feel better
7523086 it feels like every muscle in your body is cramped up and sore
7523087 it hurts to walk if you have steps in your house you dread the fact that you have more than one floor on monday after the game
7523088 its not really until thursday that my bodys kind of coming around to feeling like normal again
7523089 as much as i hate to admit it i wasnt fully mentally focused
7523090 i like to use the football field and practice and being around the guys as a place to get away but i still had something lingering
7523091 but weve handled it everyone has learned from their mistakes and were ready to move on
7523092 it just wasnt the law stuff my grandmother linda caucci died in the middle of the season before the michigan game i was very close to her
7523093 he didnt play as well as he could have i think he knows that
7523094 but now he seems to be his old self and thats important for us to be good we have to have a good centerfielder
7523095 it was tough to have a killer instinct when you have other things in your head
7523096 but after the preliminary hearing in may 2007 when no one testified against him and the judge still held him over that was the only time i saw a negative emotion
7523097 the message theyre sending is that football players can do whatever they want and theres no accountability
7523098 scirrotto shouldnt be on the team let alone a captain
7523099 he did what i think all of us would do and his teammates rallied around him i have no problem with that
7523100 this is the best of times and the worst of times
7523101 for me to be told i look like the donovan of old what year are you talking about
7523102 those were great years 2000 04 and hopefully we can put 2008 in that category too
7523103 hes made a lot of plays so far but we have to stay patient with him
7523104 he is a rookie hes just learning we havent gone into a full game plan for a regular game im sure that hell be able to handle that but you just want to kind of walk him in slowly and get everybody else opportunities to make plays as well
7523105 its a tough situation to go through especially being at the wide receiver position where you have to do a lot of cuts its going to be tough for him i actually told him to get the surgery because i think its important to get it done early before it becomes a real problem later
7523106 maybe some of those playmakers are already on the roster but have struggled with injuries myself included that have held us back a little
7523107 everything that you get in this game youve earned whether it be a touchdown a win whatever it is
7523108 in some sense it is satisfying in that light but trust me theres a lot of work ahead
7523109 here in beijing the stars and stripes are at half mast
7523110 one of the great successes in u s olympic history
7523111 americans did really well here but we wont be happy
7523112 weve had a couple things happen but it wasnt that we werent performing
7523113 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
7523114 we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes but were not disappointed in any team or individual
7523115 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7523116 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7523117 you have a question of unlimited need and limited resources
7523118 they have a lot more to spend now and they like spending it on sports
7523119 and more and more countries are winning them there are only so many to win if the chinese are winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did
7523120 team sports are extremely popular in america and because of our culture its where we place our emphasis
7523121 but its far easier and less expensive to train one individual than it is 30 or 18 in a team sport
7523122 its a very weak position for the u s but our two ioc members are very special
7523123 peking hat der welt ein china bild gezeigt das die wirklichkeit im innern ausblendet diese olympischen spiele glichen einem tanz auf dem vulkan verbl ffende sportliche leistungen eine perfekte organisation moderne vollbesetzte stadien und ein olympisches dorf das die athleten begeisterte irgendwo und irgendwann hatte zwar jeder mal davon geh rt dass es in china gewisse probleme gibt aber davon wollte sich innerhalb des olympiadorfes niemand den spa verderben lassen
7523124 die spiele von peking waren spiele unter einer glocke ihre widerspr che m nden in offensive resignation die spiele von peking haben olympia eine neue perfekt gestylte oberfl che gegeben unter der nur noch sporadisch die probleme aufschienen die der sport mit sich selbst und den gefahren des politischen missbrauchs hat nun folgt die r ckkehr in den ern chternden alltag mit seinen ern chternden realit ten ein virtuoser maskenball ging am sonntag mit einem riesigen feuerwerk zu ende
7523125 inszeniert wie sie waren haben die spiele in peking unfreiwillig auch irritierende eigenheiten der chinesischen gesellschaft und ihres regimes offengelegt
7523126 die regierung tat alles um ihr land in m glichst gutem licht erscheinen zu lassen welchen preis das chinesische volk daf r zahlen musste blieb den besuchern allerdings verschlossen in den eigens eingerichteten demonstrationszonen fand keine einzige kundgebung statt das spricht nicht unbedingt f r vollst ndige zustimmung sondern ist eher ein indiz f r eine repressive politik
7523127 das wirkliche china haben wir nicht erlebt wie das postolympische china aussieht wohl eher so wie vorher denn der vorhang des schaufensters f r die ganze welt kann wieder gezogen werden eine hoffnung bleibt die chinesische jugend hunderttausende von boys und girls haben einen halben monat gesehen wie ihr leben auch sein k nnte
7523128 unbestritten bleibt dass im reich der mitte vieles nicht zum besten bestellt ist doch der sport und seine weltweit gr te veranstaltung sind nicht nach china gekommen um dies zu ndern der sport hat im gegenteil eigene ungel ste probleme das gr te ist und bleibt der dopingmissbrauch
7523129 h tten diese olympischen sommerspiele auf dem mond stattgefunden dann w re man restlos begeistert gewesen doch das bedeutendste sportfest fand nicht auf dem mond statt sondern in china als kurzzeitbesucher w re es fatal blo aufgrund dieser paar impressionen in der abgeschirmten kunstwelt olympia alles f r gut zu befinden man w rde damit genau in die propagandafalle tappen welche das chinesische regime aufgestellt hat
7523130 die organisation war ohne fehl und tadel die sportanlagen die er ffnungs und abschlussfeier waren beeindruckend dennoch kommt man nicht umhin die festnahmen ausl ndischer aktivisten zu bem ngeln die gegen die lage in tibet protestierten die zusage chinas in parks d rfe demonstriert werden erwies sich als heuchelei keine der beantragten kundgebungen wurde erlaubt
7523131 die olympischen spiele in peking waren ein unbestreitbarer erfolg f r china und sein totalit res regime peking hat erreicht was es wollte es hat der welt sein wirtschaftswunder unter beweis gestellt und sich als eine supermacht pr sentiert die japan definitiv vom spitzenplatz in asien verdr ngt hat f r den westen bleiben ein bitterer beigeschmack und das gef hl des scheiterns was die freiheitsrechte in china betrifft hat man absolut nichts erreicht
7523132 london wird es schwer haben die spiele von peking zu bertreffen die organisation war gut es wurden 38 weltrekorde aufgestellt die bef rchtungen in sachen sicherheit und luftverschmutzung bewahrheiteten sich nicht ob die spiele auch positive auswirkungen f r die menschenrechte und die politische lage in china haben werden wird sich erst mit der zeit herausstellen
7523133 auf wiedersehen an die etwas zu perfekten spiele man wird sich an peking als pr chtig erinnern aber ein volksfest war das bestimmt nicht
7523134 ob wohl auch das staatlich kontrollierte lachen der chinesen mit der schlussfeier in peking erloschen ist
7523135 china inszenierte alles selbst das wetter kritische stimmen geh rten nicht dazu daf r wurde der welt ein roter teppich ausgerollt
7523136 zwei wochen lang schaute die welt in das lachende gesicht eines vorz glichen gastgebers china eroberte viele herzen
7523137 die schlussfeier war zwar k rzer als die show zur er ffnung doch auch sie gl nzte mit einem vornehmen stil in dem die chinesische vergangenheit gegenwart und zukunft verflochten waren die tausenden teilnehmer an den massenszenen waren makellos und zeigten die ergebnisse ihrer einj hrigen vorbereitung f r die abschlussminuten der olympiade in peking
7523138 niemand kann china aufhalten die olympischen spiele in peking hat die kommunistische partei chinas gewonnen der westen hat verloren
7523139 china die neue supermacht der vorhang ist gefallen china ist der gro e sieger seiner ersten spiele sein hundertj hriger traum ist in erf llung gegangen es kann stolz darauf sein zwei wochen lang die heftigsten polemiken und sch rfsten kritiken die olympia in den vergangenen drei ig jahren ausgel st hat unterdr ckt zu haben wie durch ein wunder haben nach der er ffnungszeremonie sport und olympische br derlichkeit die oberhand gewonnen welche auswirkungen diese spiele auf die chinesische gesellschaft haben wird wird uns die zukunft zeigen
7523140 china siegreich auf der ganzen linie die freude am letzten tag der spiele war sp rbar aber auch die erleichterung die freiwilligen helfer weinten vor gl ck die polizisten wirkten ersch pft
7523141 wie ein feuerwerk nach 16 tagen hervorragender wettk mpfe sind die 29
7523142 china der gigant der 100 medaillen in der schlussfeier bejubelt china seine erfolge aber wir d rfen nicht vergessen was sich hinter der fassade der perfekten und fr hlichen spiele zum beispiel in tibet abgespielt hat aber jenseits der b sen gedanken und der medaillenflut gibt es ein china das auf jeden fall gewonnen hat das china der menschen arrivederci in london 2012
7523143 china fehlt die goldmedaille f r toleranz auch die abschiedsfeier war wieder grandios die spiele sind vorbei peking wird wieder was es ist
7523144 lasst uns richtig britische spiele vorbereiten nun zieht die olympische fahne nach westen
7523145 als er die olympische fahne w hrend der aufwendigen abschlussfeier im vogelnest stadion entgegennahm versprach b rgermeister boris johnson dass london auf gro britanniens witz flair fantasie und einfallsreichtum setzen werde um an den erfolg der pekinger spiele anzukn pfen tats chlich m ssen die spiele bei einem budget das etwa die h lfte pekings ausmacht neu erfunden werden das ist eine riesige herausforderung aber nicht ganz so entmutigend wie es klingt
7523146 unbequeme fragen wie gefangene aus gewissensgr nden freie rede und tibet drohten die gro e feier zu berschatten dazu ist es nicht gekommen nicht weil die fragen in irgendeiner weise beantworten worden w ren der globale blick verschob sich schlicht von den menschenrechten zu den goldmedaillen die chinesische supermacht hat die spiele benutzt um ihre neue macht zu demonstrieren was die spiele f r den rest der welt gro artig gemacht haben war schlicht und einfach der sport london sollte das vertrauen haben sich darauf zu konzentrieren

7523158 so many coaches come from outside of the school system as much as 60 75 and in many cases the age of coaches is getting younger
7523159 yet they have in many cases zero training to work with kids as a result there have been a spike in the number of inappropriate relationships

7523175 research shows that people consume more when the cost of operating something is reduced this means the benefits of energy efficiency are lost as consumers take advantage of energy savings to heat larger homes or drive bigger cars

7523427 it will be interesting to see how this experiment will turn out

7523445 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers
7523446 but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial

7523457 its clear that this trader is playing this position as a cheap bearish bet

7523588 i doubt if the politicians promoting this have any idea what theyre promoting
7523589 you can store information using it you can communicate information using it
7523590 most of us who become mathematicians do so not because of our education but in spite of it
7523591 were turning kids off a subject that is useful and incredibly interesting and beautiful if taught correctly
7523592 i first took algebra in eighth grade from a bilious creepy teacher who called all the girls hon and all the boys son
7523593 at any age we will take the drudgery as long as we see a reason to do it
7523594 it takes the arithmetic youve learned and lets you answer questions not just 5 4 what it lets you change the unknown to 5 what 20
7523595 in fact if i had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a childs natural curiosity and love of pattern making i couldnt possibly do as good a job as is currently being done
7523596 i simply wouldnt have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless soul crushing ideas that constitute contemporary mathematics education
7523597 im just not sure everyone can teach algebra so that the kids understand it and make it fun
7523598 scant attention has been paid to this critical issue and californias approach to math instruction still doesnt add up
7523599 my fear is its going to turn kids off and contribute to the dropout rate
7523600 we would not want to put an age level on it
7523601 some kids are not ready for algebra in the eighth grade
7523602 weve seen over the years if you try to accelerate that it just doesnt work at redwood we saw a lot of kids that came in and then had to repeat it again in the ninth grade
7523603 the kids are leaving fourth grade now that will be required systemwide to take the eighth grade algebra 1 test
7523604 we have three years to get them to grade level
7523605 stand firm in your refusal to remain conscious during algebra in real life i assure you there is no such thing as algebra
7523606 algebra the intensive study of the last three letters of the alphabet
7523607 the fact is that there is nothing as dreamy and poetic nothing as radical subversive and psychedelic as mathematics
7523608 i dont know anybody who uses algebra but im not hanging out with architects and engineers
7523609 algebra is the gateway to critical thinking pivotal for success in science engineering and technology
7523610 i was more interested in solving the mystery of the maidenform bra than i was in alge bra but the teachers got through to me
7523611 algebra definitely set me on a path to study the humanities literature and philosophy hold many complex concepts that lead to better critical thinking
7523612 at the risk of perpetuating the stereotype of librarians id be glad to state on the record that algebra is uniquely useless in life and that the only good number is a call number
7523613 i am 77 years old a retired priest of the episcopal church i nearly died trying to do algebra in 1946
7523614 what is always to be hoped is that the instructor will reach the kids natural curiosity math is actually fun and it is easy

7523616 when youre riding a motorcycle if youre passing by a bakery you can smell the fresh bread being baked on the other hand if youre behind a garbage truck youre going to smell that garbage truck
7523617 but youre out there in the environment up close with the wind blowing in your face on a hot summer day or the cold wind on a cold winter day
7523618 i ride a motorcycle because i enjoy the stress reduction it provides me when riding out on back roads it really enables you to see parts of the country you miss in a car being on a motorcycle requires you to be much more aware of your surroundings enabling you to notice many things on the road that we usually take for granted
7523619 my dad always spoke about that experience with a twinkle in his eye
7523620 a daredevil by nature he passed this trait onto me he was not pleased to learn of my new hobby when i first started riding i tried to remind him that i was merely following in his footsteps

7523624 haar boek tinus tinus heb ik de week voor roth drie keer gelezen en tijdens de wedstrijd heb ik er veel aan gedacht het gaf me de kracht om door te gaan het levensverhaal van leontien en haar anorexia is zo bijzonder ze moest van zo ver komen om de allerbeste te worden als zij dat kon moet ik het ook kunnen
7523625 nee jammer genoeg niet ik zag haar wel vaak trainen in de buurt van krimpen aan de lek waar ik vandaan kom dan fietste ze me wel eens tegemoet het is er nooit van gekomen even bij haar aan te haken
7523626 het was een re el doel ik wist uit trainingen en andere wedstrijden dat ik het record kon verbeteren ik geloofde erin en als je gelooft kun je het ook het was wel jammer dat het op de wedstrijddag verschrikkelijk slecht weer was vooral bij het fietsen mijn sterkste onderdeel heb ik daardoor veel tijd laten liggen op natte wegen ben ik angstig omdat ik vorig jaar een keer lelijk ben gevallen in de afdalingen en bochten reed ik als een omaatje ik heb wel veel goedgemaakt op de marathon die ik in 2 54 liep maar onder betere omstandigheden kan ik nog veel harder een tijd van 8 40 acht ik zeker mogelijk
7523627 dat is niet gunstig voor mij bij het zwemmen raak ik altijd wat achterop en de fietsafstand is wellicht te kort om het verschil goed te maken bovendien heb ik gezien dat het een sterk deelnemersveld is
7523628 ik ga er vol voor tot het gaatje ik ben niet het type dat het in een wedstrijd rustig aan kan doen
7523629 dat is het wimbledon van de triatlon eigenlijk is die wedstrijd veel belangrijker voor mij dan het wk in almere het was ook een tweestrijd maar toch doe ik ze allebei ik wil toch ook een wk in eigen land niet overslaan
7523630 ik wilde het parkoers verkennen fietsen op lange rechte stukken met tegenwind vereist een heel andere tred en verzet dan fietsen in de heuvels want meestal fiets ik in een bergachtige omgeving omdat mijn vriend in oostenrijk woont de triatlon heeft daar ook veel meer aanzien dan hier dat merkte ik wel na mijn zege in roth het was de eerste dagen na de wedstrijd een gekkenhuis nog steeds krijg ik veel aandacht ik heb deze week afspraken moeten afzeggen de week voor een belangrijke wedstrijd wil ik namelijk rust en houd ik me aan mijn vaste rituelen zoals twee dagen voor de race uitgebreid in een bad met zout geen chocola eten en geen cafe ne

7523690 i cannot see how key elements in the treaty could be given effect simply by legislation particularly as we have already held a referendum on the whole treaty
7523691 hopefully this matter can be revisited in the days and weeks ahead
7523692 no matter what way it is dressed up or undressed another referendum is not going to work
7523693 attempting or purporting to ratify the lisbon treaty by the oireachtas would be illegitimate and would precipitate a constitutional crisis
7523694 would be an unprecedented breach of faith with the citizens of ireland of a most egregious nature
7523695 the wording put to the people on the june 12th said among other things the state may ratify the treaty of lisbon the people said no if they say no and refuse to give permission to ratify i dont think the government could now go ahead and ratify it or bits of it so i think thats out
7523696 it might have been possible to ratify it without a referendum beforehand i dont know its no longer possible once the people the ultimate repository of sovereignty have spoken
7523697 accordingly lisbon stripped of any potentially constitutional element not already covered by the licence of previous referendums may be passed and it is constitutionally proper that it should be passed by the oireachtas
7523698 thus the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary those opt outs would cover those elements of lisbon which legal experts determine may raise constitutional issues and may have to be put to the irish people
7523699 such issues may include for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
7523700 those questions would be put as specific and separate questions to the irish people for their approval
7523701 if approval was not forthcoming on these specific questions then the oireachtas would seek to exercise opt outs in those areas and could proceed to ratify lisbon without those elements forming part of the treaty being ratified by ireland

7523742 playing the populism card the idea that rich are bad poor are good the nobility of america lies in the poor i think thats a losing general election argument i think its a losing argument period
7523743 the rich are as patriotic as the poor if you ask of them but what doesnt work and what i dont want to be part of is this class warfare kind of argument
7523744 class warfare isnt that what the obama camp is trying to stir up wonder if biden will advise obama against such a thing
7523745 bill clinton does not think barack obama will be a great president and he doesnt want to say so
7523746 but hes a pro hell give an endorsement he also likes doing things last minute and he likes to just go out there and say whats on his mind
7523747 the greatest charge against john mccain has been that he has been in washington too long to make a difference in the white house with the addition of sen joe biden the obama campaign can no longer make this charge perhaps the greatest problem with his vice presidential selection is that we all know joe biden and weve written him off after several failed attempts at the presidency all that obama has managed to do with this pick is alert the world that john mccain is right he does have a glaring weakness in foreign policy

7523781 an ideal way to learn how to tap the greatest asset of your professional life your network
7523782 as linkedin struggles to remain relevant in an ever more socially networked world
7523783 known to most people as the web site they begrudgingly visit every few months to approve be my contact invitations
7523784 they speak their minds so you see bullying in the form of teasing taunting social isolation and name calling
7523785 kids who are bullied are at greater risk of physical symptoms physical complaints emotional problems and academic underachievement
7523786 when you see signs of being anxious sad and withdrawn of having a kid move off their typical personality it alerts you that something is going on
7523787 when you see a real change in a childs personality or their normal routine its a bad sign
7523788 one of the reasons kids dont tell their parents they are being bullied is the fear that their parents will run in and do something about it and they think that will make it worse
7523789 you often know them your kids have been in school together you feel like calling them up so theyre on the defensive and really its never a point of resolution
7523790 you need to find out when it is happening where it is happening and exactly what is going on
7523791 younger kids have a limited arsenal from which to draw
7523792 they want to know about it because it ripples into the classrooms and places that arent visible to them
7523793 i do not want parents to leave us out of the scenario
7523794 you will encounter situations where parents will tell their kids if you are hit i want you to hit back
7523795 the best case scenario as local school principal we are bullyproof fully free of any bully incidents that we are truly here with academic focus no fighting no teasing no name calling none of that were here to learn
7523796 rates are slightly lower as it is the second week of the fortnight so demand is less but we had the auction outflows today which drained 60 billion rupees
7523797 rates are likely to edge higher next week as we have the cash reserve ratio hike taking effect on saturday
7523798 the weak rupee is helping prices and we also saw a rise in copper shipments from japan which is supporting prices

7523916 ive actually never met augusten just emailed and talked that way
7523917 when augusten finished his latest novel a wolf at the table he came up with the idea of the audio version of the book
7523918 he wanted to have almost a score to the audio version and have these original songs the first audio book i ever heard years ago was david sedaris me talk pretty one day it was hysterical i dont do a lot of audio books but i love listening to npr
7523919 i was completely perplexed on how to even begin because i had never written a song for anybody
7523920 and certainly not about a book that had nothing to do with me

7524201 magnesium is indeed the unsung hero and is a key nutriceutical that everybody needs to know about
7524202 a species of red algae for instance produces under increased ultraviolet radiation less red light harvesting proteins thus decreasing the absorption of radiation the typical red colour of the alga fades and the plant gets white tips
7524203 the algae additionally produce substances which react similar to melanin in human skins mycosporin amino acids maa
7524204 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms
7524205 our investigations show that the distribution of certain species of brown algae is inhibited by the climate of ultraviolet radiation the algae are displaced into deeper water layers if ultraviolet radiation increases
7524206 we want to observe the development of marine coastal ecosystems in the face of global climate change not only an increased ultraviolet radiation plays a decisive role but also the water temperature which has been increased by the greenhouse effect this increase in temperature can particularly be felt on spitsbergen in the atlantic sector of the arctic
7524207 our findings suggest that among children from less acculturated families participation in this oral health program leads to not only more favorable beliefs about the health related preventing cavities and gum diseases and psychosocial beautiful smile and self confidence benefits of oral care behavior but also an increase in oral care behavior such as brushing flossing and dental checkups
7524208 their intention to reciprocate toward the company is proportionate to their perceptions of how much the program has helped their children and family
7524209 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
7524210 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
7524211 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
7524212 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
7524213 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
7524214 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
7524215 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
7524216 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
7524217 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
7524218 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues
7524219 this area of research and specifically this and other projects led by drs hupert and xiong shows how fields such as the engineering sciences can contribute to solving medical and public health problems

7524222 we suggest that peoples willingness to take psychological enhancements will largely depend on beliefs about whether those enhancements will alter characteristics considered fundamental to self identity
7524223 together this research converges to highlight the importance of identity expression and preservation in governing the choices and lives of consumers
7524224 we think that the distribution builder can function like a flight simulator allowing investors to explore the outcomes of their decisions with only virtual outcomes
7524225 beyond financial services the basic db framework could be used to study other consumer choices in which there is a risk reward tradeoff including waiting times at health clinics or on customer support lines delivery times of packages and overage charges for mobile phone plans

7524227 the sheer amount of diversity the students discovered surprised everybody strobel said
7524228 we have only just begun to tap the potential of these microorganisms our undergraduates have given us a peek at the treasure these habitats hold and we need to move quickly to preserve them
7524229 unless you are in a situation where speed is of the essence
7524230 everybody out of the water they found syringes in the water
7524231 we were really grossed out and our kids were grossed out too
7524232 what we do here is the engineering and developing of the product not the field work
7524233 real sailors and navy officers oversee the work so the navy gets what it wants at the end of the day
7524234 its the model program on how to do it right
7524235 it was absolutely critical its not just hardware but the people who realize what the system can and cannot do
7524236 the requirements for the aegis system come from the pentagon
7524237 but the lockheed martin engineers have gotten smart and come up with their own upgrades the information flows both ways between the navy and industry
7524238 we test the radar and simulate things to test the whole system you have to go to a ship at sea
7524239 japan was our first international customer they bought four aegis ships and came back and bought two more systems
7524240 we have a philosophy build a little test a little
7524241 if we continue to update the system and see results
7524242 we could be working out of moorestown for a long time
7524243 i forgive you its not me the one who has to give the forgiveness its god that has to do the forgiveness
7524244 in the world that i study everybodys trying to kill the biofilm
7524245 but theres not a concrete answer for that and thats why you need to understand methods
7524246 thats why we can be one of the few labs in the world that can focus on methods development
7524247 every time a person buys a product with an epa approved efficacy claim such as kills 99 percent of bacteria the public trusts the validity of the process used to prove that claim
7524248 our goal is to grow bacteria in a way thats relevant to how the bacteria exist where the product is used
7524249 that way we can have more confidence in the products actual effectiveness and so can the public
7524250 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
7524251 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules
7524252 there are three sides to every story yours mine and the truth

7524255 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
7524256 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
7524257 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
7524258 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while
7524259 but it hadnt actually been tied to matrix degradation which is thought to be important for metastasis and spread of cells through the body
7524260 the middle place is about calling home instinctively even when all the paperwork a marriage license a notarized deed two birth certificates and seven years of tax returns clearly indicates youre an adult but all the same there you are clutching the phone and thanking god that youre still somebodys daughter

7524266 our program is going to focus on solutions working with companies and organizations to create sustainable approaches to what they do
7524267 its definitely a job market thats going to increase in the future as more communities more businesses try to tackle the idea of sustainability we want to train people for those leadership jobs
7524268 i love it where i live and i dont want to see it developed
7524269 i was reading that about 40 percent of pollution coming from the car happens in the first two minutes or first two miles
7524270 if we could avoid those short trips we could eliminate a lot of pollution from cars and vehicles
7524271 this is one of the issues that is universally supported by students and faculty
7524272 people today get it that we all have to do our part to make a difference

7524286 architecture is big business today but that he now stands virtually alone underscores a disturbing shift in the architectural profession during the past decade or so by abandoning fantasy for the more pragmatic aspects of building the profession has lost some of its capacity for self criticism not to mention one of its most valuable imaginative tools

7524326 the person suddenly without warning has a sense of being immersed in a flame or rose colored cloud or perhaps rather a sense that the mind is itself filled with such a cloud of haze simultaneously or instantly following the above sense and emotional experiences there comes to the person an intellectual illumination quite impossible to describe like a flash there is presented to his consciousness a clear conception a vision in outline of the meaning and drift of the universe he does not come to believe merely but he sees and knows that the cosmos which to the self conscious mind seems made up of dead matter is in fact far otherwise is in very truth a living presence he sees that instead of men being as it were patches of life scattered through an infinite sea of non living substance they are in reality specks of relative death in an infinite ocean of life he sees that the life which is in man is eternal as all life is eternal that the soul of man is as immortal as god is that the universe is so built and ordered that without any peradventure all things work together for the good of each and all that the foundation principle of the world is what we call love and that the happiness of every individual is in the long run absolutely certain the person who passes through this experience will learn in the few minutes or even moments of its continuance more than in months or years of study and he will learn much that no study ever taught or can teach

7524355 we are accustomed to understand art to be only what we hear and see in theatres concerts and exhibitions together with buildings statues poems novels but all this is but the smallest part of the art by which we communicate with each other in life all human life is filled with works of art of every kind from cradlesong jest mimicry the ornamentation of houses dress and utensils up to church services buildings monuments and triumphal processions it is all artistic activity so that by art in the limited sense of the word we do not mean all human activity transmitting feelings but only that part which we for some reason select from it and to which we attach special importance

7524392 we demand so much from our avid ds systems over the course of a week we may be asked to work on a wide range of projects from pal trailers to episodic television and effects work to 4 4 4 features that will be filmed out
7524393 weve been beta testing the new version of avid ds for a few months here on a variety of different projects we are very impressed with the performance improvements color management capabilities and the addition of the advanced color correction tools with secondaries having all those effects in real time in 4 4 4 is a tremendous timesaver our clients expect speed accuracy and style regardless of the type of project or how tight the deadline avid ds 10 is the perfect platform allowing us to continue meeting these needs for our clients
7524394 without question the avid ds system offers the highest quality integrated toolset for the online editorial process
7524395 the new real time secondary color correction feature is excellent and our clients love the grades we are able to add to their final product overall there are just loads of little extras and improvements that i keep stumbling upon which are huge timesavers and just another example of how avid has been really listening to the user base

7524403 nigeria produces almost 45 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7524404 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 percent of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after russia
7524405 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7524406 this explains why south africa insists that developed countries should take the lead in emissions reduction before developing nations cut down their own emissions
7524407 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for climate change do not make any efforts to reduce theirs
7524408 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries

7524424 i was walking along a path with two friends the sun was setting suddenly the sky turned blood red i paused feeling exhausted and leaned on the fence there was blood and tongues of fire above the blue black fjord and the city my friends walked on and i stood there trembling with anxiety and i sensed an infinite scream passing through nature

7524625 im not good with that ill go home and try to hang out but im not very good with that thats the only time i probably take stuff home
7524626 even when you win games you try to be very critical on it and get it right
7524627 because theres a lot of stuff to get on right away
7524628 sometimes i dont even want to get out of bed
7524629 your backs hurting your knees hurting your shoulders hurting your heads hurting its pretty tough
7524630 when you get beat up and then go lift weights it makes your body feel better
7524631 it feels like every muscle in your body is cramped up and sore
7524632 it hurts to walk if you have steps in your house you dread the fact that you have more than one floor on monday after the game
7524633 its not really until thursday that my bodys kind of coming around to feeling like normal again
7524634 m s de mil millones de d lares para los productores que se sumar n a lo que ya est en el presupuesto
7524635 que la dirigencia agropecuaria diga que no hemos hecho nada me parece poco generoso porque en realidad venimos resolviendo un mont n de cosas hemos dado respuestas y ellos lo saben pero est la cuesti n pol tica en el medio no hace falta mucho para darse cuenta
7524636 si se escuchan los discursos del s bado me parece que queda bastante claro los dirigentes se est n empujando solos
7524637 espec ficamente estamos evaluando c mo evoluciona el mercado de la leche en polvo
7524638 este a o se est elevando la producci n de leche y seguramente lleguemos al r cord de 1998 no es verdad que estemos perdiendo leche
7524639 es muy adecuado para el 70 por ciento de los productores pero sabemos que hay que dar respuesta a otros tambos aunque eso no pasa s lo por los precios
7524640 seg n dijo johana al personal de gendarmer a se fue en represalia porque su mam y su pap se hab an peleado
7524641 daddy wasnt it lucky that we won those four gold medals
7524642 its a huge concern because its at a park at 5 p m on 24th street which is a very busy roadway and not only the other drivers and vehicles on the roadway you have the park with the kids and the parents
7524643 i will be able to dance i went to the hospital ill be fine
7524644 it will illuminate what fountainbridges most famous former milkman thinks of many aspects of scottish culture and life including sport architecture and of course the gothic tendency in scots literature
7524645 are you strong enough to be my man or my president
7524646 what im hearing from sen obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy
7524647 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7524648 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7524649 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7524650 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues
7524651 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7524652 its like honey what do you want to be a pariah what do you want to be crucified its a good thing in this country we dont have to tell anybody its no ones business who we vote for
7524653 like the original this trial is ultimately unsuccessful thus creating an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy
7524654 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
7524655 super gelegenheit zum kontakte kn pfen und alte kameraden kennen zu lernen
7524656 it has also afforded an opportunity to break fresh ground on certain issues where perceptions differed
7524657 as much as i hate to admit it i wasnt fully mentally focused
7524658 i like to use the football field and practice and being around the guys as a place to get away but i still had something lingering
7524659 but weve handled it everyone has learned from their mistakes and were ready to move on
7524660 it just wasnt the law stuff my grandmother linda caucci died in the middle of the season before the michigan game i was very close to her
7524661 he didnt play as well as he could have i think he knows that
7524662 but now he seems to be his old self and thats important for us to be good we have to have a good centerfielder
7524663 it was tough to have a killer instinct when you have other things in your head
7524664 but after the preliminary hearing in may 2007 when no one testified against him and the judge still held him over that was the only time i saw a negative emotion
7524665 the message theyre sending is that football players can do whatever they want and theres no accountability
7524666 scirrotto shouldnt be on the team let alone a captain
7524667 he did what i think all of us would do and his teammates rallied around him i have no problem with that
7524668 to prepare as much as you can and watch a lot of video especially their bullpen guys
7524669 god forbid if someone gets hurt you have to be ready to go in right away you have to be ready at any moment other than that the secret to pinch hitting is that it has to be something you want to do
7524670 on a club thats in a playoff race and they have enough respect to call me up
7524671 here in beijing the stars and stripes are at half mast
7524672 one of the great successes in u s olympic history
7524673 americans did really well here but we wont be happy
7524674 weve had a couple things happen but it wasnt that we werent performing
7524675 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
7524676 we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes but were not disappointed in any team or individual
7524677 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7524678 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7524679 you have a question of unlimited need and limited resources
7524680 they have a lot more to spend now and they like spending it on sports
7524681 and more and more countries are winning them there are only so many to win if the chinese are winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did
7524682 team sports are extremely popular in america and because of our culture its where we place our emphasis
7524683 but its far easier and less expensive to train one individual than it is 30 or 18 in a team sport
7524684 its a very weak position for the u s but our two ioc members are very special

7524688 we all know kobe likes to have the ball at the end
7524689 we played with great character in one of the greatest games in international basketball history
7524690 we tried to stop them we couldnt stop them entirely
7524691 we wanted you to bring all your egos because thats how you get better
7524692 what you saw today is a team everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant
7524693 liaison between the team and the media that covers us on a daily basis
7524694 we prepare the players and the coaches for press conferences and try to help the media come up with stories about the team
7524695 i think people always want to say that the t o situation was the toughest for us but i dont think it was
7524696 i look back on the 3 13 year in 1998 and we saw coaches let go and that was the toughest thing for me everywhere you turned people werent happy i really base things on wins and losses
7524697 i dont mean to be simple when i say that but i really believe that is the goal of this organization and when you dont win its tough especially in a city like philadelphia because the fans care so much they want to know why when youre not winning and theyre not happy about it and they shouldnt be
7524698 i dont pretend to have any consequences of winning and losing
7524699 i know the media is part of the nfl world especially in philadelphia
7524700 playoff baseball without the yankees or red sox and with the rays and twins would no doubt scare tv executives and delight thousands of baseball fans sick of watching andy pettitte face jason varitek
7524701 everything that you get in this game youve earned whether it be a touchdown a win whatever it is
7524702 in some sense it is satisfying in that light but trust me theres a lot of work ahead
7524703 its a fine line you walk because the player has to know that the trainer is out for the best for him and at the same time the trainer has to have enough wherewithal to push the guys to get them back out there
7524704 i get in the ice tub but in terms of if i have an injury id rather not go in there if i dont have to
7524705 its definitely different because you want to do something special
7524706 instead of just proving yourself for your own sake you want to prove yourself as a member of the olympic team that you deserve to be among all these other great athletes
7524707 guvernarea comunista va marca si de aceasta data sub umbrela zilei republicii 27 august doua evenimente incompatibile
7524708 tony had some good blocks and then he had some blocks he needs to work on
7524709 i thought the effort was there i think he continues to need to work on his technique
7524710 we have a long time before that first game so im contemplating on that
7524711 dont you know that 75 percent of the world is covered by water and the other 25 percent is covered by zont
7524712 this is the best of times and the worst of times
7524713 he was roughed up a bit but hes ok and were happy hes coming home
7524714 jeff said he was slapped around and threatened with them saying do you want your head cut off or do you want to be shot
7524715 all they had to eat was rice and hot water after they fell asleep they were awakened and taken to an interrogation room and it started all over
7524716 they tore up his plane ticket but when they got to the airport they told him to use his credit card to buy a ticket on air china
7524717 he said no and they took his credit card and charged the flight another guy didnt have a credit card or money so they charged his ticket with jeffs credit card
7524718 its a great relief and were happy that hes coming home
7524719 the issues of tibet and freedom of speech in china are still there but it will be nice to have him home so we can work on them together
7524720 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever

7524731 john i know becky is having that yard sale today with her parents but she wont be at that thing all day i want you to listen just listen to her conversations across this line thats all you have to do
7524732 yeah i saw becky as i was coming in the hollow a while ago she was down there with her dad putting up that yard sale sign i couldnt talk to her man i wanted to but i couldnt i dont know what it is about becky but i just cant bring myself to say anything to her im dying to but i cant yeah i love her
7524733 i am never giving up on you youre mine you hear me youre my woman
7524734 i want to do what i need to do to get back on the field and keep my condition where it is
7524735 i was frustrated more than anything i wanted to finish up that last little bit of action with the first team out there and get off the field make another play it was frustrating in that respect
7524736 i didnt pay attention to it until you say something about it
7524737 when you have an ankle twist or sprain thats part of the game
7524738 i like to put myself in tough situations in practice so that when game time comes hopefully the game is a lot slower than it is
7524739 ive been rotating from free to strong safety as camps been going on and i knew id have the opportunity to play both and i feel prepared to play free safety so its an opportunity for me to get out there more
7524740 each position has its own techniques and variables you have to master
7524741 if youre going to be a strong safety one week and a free safety the next there are a few things you have to refresh in your mind its not that big a deal

7524747 all the cool red sox fans are addicted to the soxaholix
7524748 were as shocked as you are but there is apparently at least one member of red sox nation with a sense of humor and perspective
7524749 this is by far one of the most entertaining baseball blogs ive seen
7524750 a funny sexy and poignant look at the journey of three all american girls as they mature from cheerleaders to sorority sisters to independent women spanning the turbulent 60s through the late 80s vanities celebrates the lives and loves of three best friends caught up in rapidly changing times
7524751 a whole new scene no longer just a coda or epilogue set years after the ending of the original play
7524752 the 60s and early 70s were arguably the richest era for pop music in the whole 20th century from the beatles to burt bacharach to even broadway which as we know was enjoying sort of its last gasp at the top of the hit parade with everything from hair to hello dolly since vanities the play takes place over that entire period i heard the music in the piece right away and since the story revolves around a friendship between three women thats what i zeroed in on for inspiration the girl group music of the supremes and shirelles the songs of lesley gore and ellie greenwich moving through the decade into the more soulful sounds of legends like janis joplin and tina turner and the singer songwriters like joni mitchell carly simon and carole king interestingly enough those last three just had a best selling book published about their music and the complicated relationship between them called girls like us one thing thats different about the musical is that it goes beyond the timeframe of the original play and adds a new scene set 15 years later that takes us to about 1990 by which time pop music obviously had a whole different kind of sound so we have some fun with that for one song
7524753 but hopefully the whole thing is filtered through a theatrical sensibility and my own style and sounds cohesive as a score i love jacks original play and these three characters and ive been having the time of life musicalizing all of it with him

7524757 under the provision of our constitution we incline to the opinion that the legislature cannot inhibit the citizen from bearing arms openly because it authorizes him to bear them for the purposes of defending himself and the state and it is only when carried openly that they can be efficiently used for defence
7524758 section 13a 11 73 does not prohibit carrying an unlicensed pistol if the pistol is unconcealed and the person is on foot ala code 13a 11 52 applies only the extent that it is consistent with ala code 13a 11 73 because it is the later statute and a complete revision of the subject matter
7524759 the states evidence shows that the pistol was in a scabbard or holster worn on the side and was not covered we call attention to title 14 175 recompiled code 1958 which reads
7524760 it is to be observed that this law prohibits carrying a pistol concealed or not in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person except without a license therefor 4 it does not prohibit an unconcealed pistol
7524761 code 1940 t 14 175 as amended makes it an offense for a person who has no license therefor except on his land abode or place of business 1 to carry a pistol in any vehicle or 2 to carry a pistol concealed on or about his person thus a permit is not required when a person afoot carries an unconcealed pistol
7524762 except as otherwise provided in this article no person shall carry a pistol about his person on premises not his own or under his control
7524763 no person shall carry a pistol in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person except on his land in his own abode or fixed place of business without a license therefor as hereinafter provided
7524764 2 may a person carry an unlicensed and unconcealed pistol anywhere either on his own property on the public highways public property or on the land of another person without violating 13a 11 52 or 13a 11 73 providing he is not riding in a vehicle
7524765 no county or municipal corporation instrumentality or political subdivision thereof by ordinance resolution or other enactment shall regulate in any manner gun shows the possession ownership transport carrying transfer sale purchase licensing registration or use of firearms ammunition components of firearms firearms dealers or dealers in firearm components

7524775 the first real stereo 3d for the home will be via blu ray and for that you need a standard format if everything goes perfectly this could happen in 2010 or 2011 but it never goes like that hopefully there will not be a format war
7524776 i worry that there is a segment of the population that might be harder to reach average citizens who will say come on

7524791 these bombers might have access to other industries but indications are they get their explosives from corrupt officials at mines they represented a sophisticated group who had expertise needed to use explosives these are from highly trained individuals with firearm training and military background
7524792 the increase in atm bombings is largely owing to displacement from other targets banks have more sophisticated security and even the security on cash in transit vehicles has improved therefore it is a lot more difficult to rob a bank than it is to rob an atm

7524800 theyre going to slice and dice the president and then theyre going to tie mccain to bush in the long run thats their best argument
7524801 i think going directly after mccain raises some danger because of the war hero issue
7524802 three in 10 say they support mr obama but have reservations about him or they support him only because he is the partys nominee
7524803 as they approached they noticed one of the males a 17 year old had what appeared to be the butt of a gun sticking from his waistband area

7524834 chief vincent ogbulafor is witch hunting uba over the perception that the later failed to convince former president olusegun obasanjo to retain him as pdp national secretary at the time ogbehs exco was sacked
7524835 pdp had to side with orji kalu during his tango with ogbulafor maduekwe ugochukwu led abuja faction pdp brushed aside the fact that ogbulafor was the incumbent national secretary uba is the leader of anambra pdp by virtue of his being the flagbearer
7524836 the status quo remains until another gubernatorial primary is held and uba is replaced it is only fair that his position be respected in whatever decision pdp takes on anambra what ogbulafor is doing is not only childish but runs against pdp tradition

7524838 we are going to establish the association for the disabled in every state teach them how to read and write that is for the deaf and dumb just to remove from them the stigma of their disability even those with mental disabilities the mad people on the strets are going to be part of the group because they are disabled
7524839 it is a religious duty of being a brothers keeper i feel concerned on them and it was not just a social function but a religious responsibility as one who worships his god i have always been concerned on how the disabled people are forgotten and stigmatized as if they committed heinous crimes
7524840 i was also moved by the inaction of governments and organizations that make no considerations for them especially in buildings they are left to street begging and we want to see if they can develop their own talents and skill through sensitizations to help them realize their god given special gifts
7524841 nec considered the recommendations of the dr bello haliru mohammed led committee that reviewed the report of dr alex ekwuemes national reconciliation committee nec deliberated extensively and arrived at the following resolutions
7524842 the party henceforth commits itself strictly to its electoral guidelines and constitutional provisions on issues of nomination
7524843 the era of arbitrariness in the nomination process is over nec also resolved to propose an amendment to the provisions of the partys constitution that deals with the leadership membership and functions of the board of trustees nec accepted the recommendation that the board of trustees should revert to its advisory role as contained in the pdp constitution 2001 as amended nec also accepted the recommendation that any member of the board of trustees can aspire to chair the board as against the current provision that limits the chairmanship to former holders of particular offices nec also resolved on the reconstitution of the board of trustees in line with the proposed amendments
7524844 nec also proposed an amendment to the pdp 2006 constitution to include the power of each state caucus to co opt elders into its membership this will address some of the complaints of sidelining by members of the party all nominations for appointments must come from the recommendations of state caucuses
7524845 personally i feel that it is degrading to the former president of the country to accept to serve as chairman of bot
7524846 so the period of eight years in my view is sufficient for the president to have ascended to the world stage and continental stage also if he becomes ultra partisan locally he will not have time to play at the world stage if you notice the last national convention of the party the picture of the former president was inside the brochure that is where he fits in as the chairman of bot he now reports to the national chairman of the party i think having risen to number one position he should be the father of all every political party should consult that person
7524847 it is not a slight on anybody if we right our constitution if our constitution is based on principles and not written around an individual you dont write constitution for one person or a few persons the reason i am saying this is that if a constitution is drafted bearing one person or a few in mind the danger is that if that person is no more in that particular position it means you have to go and write another one a constitution should not be based on whims and caprices of a group of individuals or one person it should be based on principles things that can stand the test of time it is not a disrespect for any particular person
7524848 television and media reportage in the development of globacom premier league at the international seminar slated for this week in abuja
7524849 we have received a lot of complaints and suggestion on how to make our game and pitches television friendly and that is why we want to ensure that we take the bull by the horn this season
7524850 the various topics have been deliberately chosen because the league body cannot afford to be left behind we just have to move because time is not on our side
7524851 the matter is important we are ready to hear it
7524852 we are extending the stay on the tribunals order by another six weeks
7524853 our foreign secretary is in the u s and the two delegations have been meeting
7524854 the united states and india will continue our vigorous joint advocacy for the initiative at the highest levels of nsg government
7524855 we will continue to work with our indian partners to persuade the nuclear suppliers group countries that such an exemption is in the international communitys best interest
7524856 tot het op een dag zo hard had gevroren dat er gele ijspegels aan de kozijnen hingen
7524857 to clip the wings of loyalists of former governor chimaroke nnamani who has remained at loggerheads with chime
7524858 as you can see damaturu is like one giant construction site now if it is not road rehabilitation they are building new roads new housing estates new hospitals and new schools just name it is being constructed it is as if the state was created yesterday because of the magnitude of construction work going on all over the state capital and elsewhere
7524859 how long did you prepare for this position before recreating these landmarks in just a little over a year
7524860 i joined politics having reached a level of contentment which i desire for myself my level of contentment is not about building palaces all over the place i am happy the way i am and i felt i could serve my people better that is why i am here having received their mandate on this they have taken us to court 12 times and 12 times we have triumphed over them my peoples mandate to me was designed and approved by god
7524861 he is trying very hard within the constraints of time to do a lot of projects in the state
7524862 when we were given this job we were not paid we were not mobilised until just about a month ago and i have papers to prove all these we still went to site with the kind of presence we made without payment the governor was very impressed and told us to bid for other jobs so we are also building five hostels and a dining hall at the yobe college modelled after the turkish international school abuja which as we speak we have gone quite far in a project awarded two months ago we have gone to the second decking on the buildings without payment
7524863 we were shocked when we read from a local newspaper that the man has paid 100 per cent to contractors and the contractors are not on site and that the man is using contractors to siphon state money
7524864 when you go to the state you will see non indigenes who are working for the state because of the kind of person he is people are ready to work for him when people say that kind of thing it pains me because this man actually has the love of his people at heart for him to be concentrating on aspects that are very crucial such as education health and agriculture shows the kind of vision he has for the state
7524865 for people to come out in a local newspaper with those kinds of stories i am talking for myself and sermatech is sad we were not paid until a month ago when we received our first payment and that was forty per cent and before you get the forty per cent you will provide a performance bond from a first class nigerian bank and tax payment guarantee in our own case because we had already gotten to a very advanced level we didnt need to produce an advance payment guarantee because we used our money to work these are the issues what basically we are saying is that people who spread false rumour and invite efcc to come and investigate the man should themselves be arrested and investigated for giving efcc wrong information
7524866 we work day and night on site with a full team of engineers and labourers i must tell you without trying to blow the governors trumpet i think the man is dedicated to making sure that his people is transformed that after four years his people will be begging him to stay on i am working in other states so i know what is going on in the states in the north i have never handled any jobs in yobe state before i saw some advertisements in the newspaper and we bidded it was my first time but the way we mobilised he was very impressed that without payment this was a serious group that he would like to work with people should be prosecuted for informing the efcc wrongly that way others will think twice before they embark on spurious allegations
7524867 under the scheme the government provided the land to the benefiting youth to cultivate through a land holding arrangement it also gave them seedlings fertilizer chemicals and free extension services some money was also given to the youth to enable them hire the services of others for planting
7524868 right now were in a time of very unforgiving markets
7524869 when you have a misstep on a project like this particularly an early flagship project there tends to be a very strong reaction and not a lot of tolerance in the market
7524870 many companies seem to have their financing worked out pretty well but if their costs escalate to the same degree then some of the others could come under pressure
7524871 can put even the best project on shaky financial ground
7524872 two or three can put it out of commission entirely
7524873 not angels nor demons no power on earth or heaven
7524874 record opposing abortion and lukewarm support of other gender issues in general
7524875 we look forward to voters in staten island and brooklyn sending a strong supporter of womens rights to washington
7524876 steve has the values we need to improve the lives of women and families in this country
7524877 we look forward to voters in staten island and brooklyn sending a strong supporter of womens rights to washington
7524878 steve has the values we need to improve the lives of women and families in this country
7524879 we were impressed with steve harrisons grasp of and support of our core issues constitutional equality for women reproductive rights equal economic opportunity stopping violence against women and ending gender and sexual orientation discrimination
7524880 lukewarm support of other gender issues in general while a member of the new york city council
7524881 a political conservative who opposed choice when his vote counted in new york city council
7524882 we cannot support someone who waivers in his support of our issues to placate his right to life constituency they have the republicans for that who will speak for women steve harrison
7524883 between may and october 2002 i attended one fundraiser for each of vito fossella john faso for comptroller and the conservative party because i was attempting to build multi party support for my anticipated non partisan city council special election race in february 2003
7524884 conversely i have given thousands of dollar to democrats before during and after that time
7524885 mr mcmahon has given thousands of dollars to the conservative party over the past 8 years and has run with their endorsement in the current election he sought their endorsement
7524886 steve harrison continues his relentlessly negative campaign because he has no record of his own to run on and no hope of winning this seat for the democratic party his hypocrisy is striking since harrison has routinely supported republican candidates in the past such as marty golden and john faso and of course contributed to the conservative party
7524887 i have never attacked mike mcmahon at any time oddly i think mike mcmahon is attacking me by claiming i am attacking him
7524888 i want stephen harrison in washington with me to fight for the people of staten island and brooklyn he will not be a rubberstamp rather he will truly represent his constituents interests on everything from protecting our country to protecting the rights of working families
7524889 now pac is pleased to endorse steve harrison for the u s house of representatives from new york
7524890 we look forward to voters in staten island and brooklyn sending a strong supporter of womens rights to washington steve has the values we need to improve the lives of women and families in this country
7524891 we were impressed with steve harrisons grasp of and support of our core issues constitutional equality for women reproductive rights equal economic opportunity stopping violence against women and ending gender and sexual orientation discrimination
7524892 mcmahon is a political conservative who opposed choice when his vote counted in nyc council we cannot support someone who waivers in his support of our issues to placate his rtl constituency they have the republicans for that who will speak for women steve harrison
7524893 ive been doing this for the better part of two years
7524894 we have a real grass roots campaign going on and he has support mainly from party officials he has more money but most of it came from pacs in washington

7524898 i know how hard it is to get in here
7524899 i saw the mentoring program when i was a student here
7524900 this district really offers a lot of resources to teachers and i can speak as someone whos been in a district where those resources were not as available or as in depth
7524901 i think its so important for teachers to have a network
7524902 the mentoring program is like a gift thats already been prepared for us
7524903 i talk to at least four or five seriously interested parties every hour
7524904 our absence would be conspicuous now that weve started especially with our alums
7524905 and its still necessary for us to tell our story
7524906 the admissions office has tracked it each year and they know its a good place to be to get in touch with students we get e mail addresses and that gets them into our system
7524907 so theres information that shows its working its not the only way to reach students but its one of the ways
7524908 and we were able to show them we were doing well

7524913 he may well have been the worst possible pick among congressional democrats when it comes to the drug war and criminal justice
7524914 what really bugs me about the biden pick is that he voted for the war and picking him inevitably blurs the message of what a gigantic mistake that was

7524918 we see the adoption of the fla by kde as a positive and important milestone in the maturity of the free software community
7524919 the fla was designed to help projects increase the legal maintainability of their software to ensure long term protection and reliability kde is among the most important free software initiatives and it is playing a central role in bringing freedom to the desktop this decision of the kde project underlines its dedication to think about how to make that freedom last
7524920 of course it should be in the users interest to ride their bicycles independently i e not having to rely on training wheels however the training wheels keep children from falling and give freedom to both the children and their parents likewise wine helped to give freedom and security to the users it is for this we are thankful and we recognise their work
7524921 it is a clear legal fact that distributing free software means people must comply with the licences gpl violations org and the ftf are now building the long term legal infrastructure for support and compliance
7524922 i believe our new agreement will help ensure sustainability for legal infrastructure to support free software in europe

7524929 like many applications the proposed windfarm is an extremly emotive subject and has cause a great deal of uncertainty for all concerned residents and the company alike
7524930 of course the final say on the agenda lies with the officers but i would be very disappointed if they did not bring the plan before us soon
7524931 fife council have an application which has long since completed all its statuory processes and is able to be determined and the only barrier seems to be the mod issue there is no evidence from them that the applicant has been able to overcome that objection
7524932 energiekontor have had since january when raf defence estates advised them that their claim that the screening of trees at st andrews wells was unfounded to develop a new scheme and they have not yet put anything to defence estates
7524933 the only option they have is to move the turbines or reduce their heights or a combination of both so the probability is that any solution would result in a significant change to the current development proposal
7524934 there is without doubt considerable benefit to the council the applicant and the hundreds of objectors for the current application to be determined on the basis of the proposal submitted
7524935 if you get too technical it can get bogged down
7524936 unfortunately too many see the frame of reference of zoning and if they dont understand zoning they shouldnt be trying to write a bylaw
7524937 i dont speak for the committee i will speak for myself and say we have made no progress
7524938 we hope to have an application for an actual wind turbine for february 2009
7524939 the signature of one joint tenant counts for the entire parcel
7524940 therefore each parcel for which at least one owner signed must be included in the threshold calculation
7524941 since very few were excluded for other reasons we conclude the protest petition contained the signatures of twenty percent or more of the total area
7524942 he doesnt rep lindsay or blake and no one knows who this creep is

7524946 agreed to come to the table to share the profits
7524947 it might well render the idea very difficult or useless
7524948 to enter into negotiations with the village if and when the project gets approved
7524949 no financial obligation on the taxing authorities of any kind
7524950 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7524951 exactly one year ago today our horse industries were facing their darkest hour with the state in lockdown and the disease spreading rapidly
7524952 during the outbreak we learnt how highly contagious equine influenza is how humans can inadvertently spread it and the importance of working with industry and all horse owners to get rid of the disease
7524953 our racing breeding and many other horse sectors like equestrian rodeo and polocrosse are back in business and are looking forward to a bright future and a spring that is memorable for the right reasons

7524969 management has shifted its focus to total shareholder returns and not growth in revenue and earnings initially 2007 and 2008 this means divestitures of businesses that are returning less than the companys weighted average cost of capital which is 9 percent 10 percent
7524970 we believe investors dont fully understand the current health of the companys underlying core businesses despite profound demand weakness in many of leggetts key customer end markets and rampant inflation in raw material costs we believe that more than two thirds of leggetts business is in an earnings upswing

7524977 das gesamtkonzept spiegelt die erstaunlichen dimensionen wider die dieses projekt mittlerweile angenommen hat gleichzeitig unterstreicht das konzept die tatsache dass es sich hier um eines der ehrgeizigsten bauprojekte der welt handelt die landschaftliche gestaltung von al ruwaya wird genau jene elemente widerspiegeln die ich am golfsport liebe und ich hoffe dass es sich als ein anspruchsvoller und sorgf ltig durchdachter golfplatz f r spieler aller spielst rken erweisen wird
7524978 we believe that repurchasing shares of our stock is a great use of capital that will increase earnings per share and provide returns both in the current year and should also compound in the future as we continue to grow

7524992 the service was beautiful said smallwood hours after the event
7524993 it was a great coming together of different faiths it was a great way to start the convention

7524995 there was no fussing about what each other religious group believes

7524997 if you are throwing a javelin itll end up in whitby
7524998 it affects the aerodynamics by creating an artificial force within the stadium so kicking a rugby ball going for goal kicks the ball will be out of play we are finished we wont be able to play rugby at the stadium
7524999 i just turned up for work and suddenly its there no consultation no notification and completely wrong and unjustifiable
7525000 with the success of the 2012 olympics looming leeds chooses to build a wind turbine less than 20 metres from an elite athletics facility this is a national disgrace and those responsible should be held accountable
7525001 its a wonderful quiet area at the moment which is very good for concentration if you have a whining noise it would create an aggravating background noise
7525002 it would interfere with throwing events anything creating a displacement of wind is going to effect a throwing event
7525003 the wind turbine at the john charles centre for sport is part of this citys commitment to develop alternative renewable energy sources particularly for large facilities like this
7525004 unfortunately the location had to be changed after it was discovered the turbine would interfere with the flight paths of bats a heavily protected species
7525005 the turbine will not adversely affect the activities undertaken on the complex especially given that the turbine can be switched off if this is required
7525006 because leos can be such utter pains to shop for around birthday time
7525007 the vase is a symbol of love warmth and happiness
7525008 berry has given a very simple silhouette a rather complex appearance though the use of various types of graphics colours and materials each pair of kicks draws upon classic imagery from their assigned city for instance los angeles features a cool blue colorway whilst the uppers are littered with paisley print and graphics of palm trees and low rider bikes new york is represented by berrys reinterpretation of the citys subway system and notoriety for graffiti whilst mexico citys most obvious inspiration comes from the colours of the national flag turning back the clocks london finds itself in medieval history while moscow uses imagery from the soviet era the tokyo themed sneakers feature nice details but will not see a release in these parts due to the usage of graphics depicting the japanese army during wartime which could cause sensitivity issues
7525009 i dont know my schedule for next year i will be hitting golf balls at the beginning of the year
7525010 at this point we cant talk about anything because we havent seen it
7525011 thats certainly an option and it would be a relatively easy fix
7525012 the important thing is that it did nothing to challenge the creation or existence of that district
7525013 we have a number of other options available that were pursuing
7525014 well have to look at the ruling and fine print on the thing and see what the impacts going to be
7525015 its curious why state legislators would vote in favor of legislation then waste taxpayer funds to work and have it overturned at the federal level
7525016 this must kill it i have never known an issue in 11 years which has seen such universal opposition
7525017 any undue harm to the site and its immediate surroundings especially when compared with the size scale and appearance of the electricity pylons nearby
7525018 when the test mast is built we hope the data it provides will show that it is not worthwhile building a wind farm here it is business interests that are the driving force behind this development not producing environmentally friendly efficient energy
7525019 i have absolutely no problem with the governments policy of promoting renewable energy however i do not accept that wind farms should be located such that they ruin the most beautiful countryside
7525020 the proposed five turbine wind farm at seamer will generate up to 15mw of electricity and will be able to make an important contribution to the teesside and hambleton draft 2010 renewable targets of 138mw and 40 3mw respectively
7525021 this is the only location i could find in wales with the right regime of winds and waves
7525022 it will be an exact replica and we will see if it works and take away what weve learned
7525023 the end game of full scale turbines would be so far off shore that they couldnt be seen from land
7525024 if we can get a deep water platform to work it has huge potential
7525025 this consultation was from our point of view as conservationists extremely positive and we were able to give advice as to the placing of the test rig based on many years of observation
7525026 we believe that given our present knowledge it should be a reasonably benign temporary presence
7525027 this kind of research is extremely valuable in light of the need to develop renewable energy resources while trying to protect our wildlife
7525028 this sounds like an exciting and innovative project which could herald a new method of harvesting clean energy far out at sea
7525029 i would want reassurance that marine life and our fishing industry wont be adversely affected by this platform and if that can be given then we have to welcome the potential of this new technology
7525030 lets get ready to step up to the plate and propose a plan that maybe hes not going to be able to argue with
7525031 this is a national issue and councils all over the country are finding themselves in similar situations
7525032 id never alter my game just because of something like that that was in the past
7525033 well see thats a fair question i just dont know the answer
7525034 the first is from the surgeon the operation went so well and you were such a model patient that he wanted to say thanks
7525035 the second is from your husband hes delighted the operation was such a success that he cant wait to get you home apparently itll be the first time hes touched the sides for years and hes very excited
7525036 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7525037 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7525038 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7525039 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7525040 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7525041 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7525042 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7525043 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7525044 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7525045 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7525046 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7525047 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7525048 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7525049 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7525050 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7525051 auch wenn viele jugendliche kreatives arbeiten zun chst doof finden am ende sind sie sehr erstaunt und stolz auf das was sie geschaffen haben
7525052 das sind wunderbare arbeiten solche ausstellungen k nnte der adk auch mal f r den d sseldorfer landtag organisieren
7525053 we felt it was important that if people started to get interested in residential wind mills that there be at least some regulations in place to give them some guidelines
7525054 before if you came to our code enforcement officer and wanted to put a windmill in your backyard there is no way he can make a determination or make a decision
7525055 most of the town of volney is either agricultural or r 1 and they are permitted in those areas
7525056 largely what it says is that there should be enough space that if windmill falls down its not going to fall down on a neighbors house
7525057 finances wont play a part in the cardinals decision at quarterback
7525058 leinart is making 735 000 this year and is due to make 1 1 million in 2009 they can afford to let him try and play his way through tough times warner is making 4 million this season in the last year of a three year deal
7525059 the international olympic committee says there is still no proof that some members of chinas gold medal womens gymnastics team were too young to compete in the games too young these girls were so young they danced their floor routine to itsy bitsy spider they were so young they played patty cake patty cake between events they were so o o o young they used their gold medals for teething rings
7525060 in china 4 9 73 pound female gymnast he kexin is so popular with fans they have come out with her likeness in a bobblehead doll wait sorry that actually is her
7525061 i wont say the chinese gymnasts were young but after each routine their coach wasnt hugging them he was burping them
7525062 hes so fast hes literally invisible to american viewers until 13 hours after he finishes
7525063 well quickly forget much of what we saw in beijing the past 17 days but some moments will linger michael phelps collecting so much gold that he could rival that james bond villain who covered his secretary in gold from head to toe bolts celebrating his laughably huge victories in a way that terrell owens may ask for pointers hope solo s shutting out the brazilians to win the gold medal the most famous wall outside of fenway parks serving as a grand backdrop to a suffocating bike race
7525064 what is so modern about sword fighting and target practice granted if vince mcmahon get his hands on the sport and has the participants turn the swords and guns on each other it would be a pay per view bonanza
7525065 a sure sign that a rhythmic gymnast might be on steroids shes the only one in the competition using a bowling ball
7525066 katie hoff with her three swimming medals and michael phelps with his eight golds call the same baltimore suburb home if towson md were a country it would rank among the top 20 medal winners
7525067 i keep hearing that its the countrys duty to spend more money on the olympics so the u s can hold its place in the medal count if somebody has to fund olympic athletes let the people at nbc do it theyve got more riding on the olympics than anybody
7525068 i am awed because china is a hulking superpower that can construct magnificent futuristic buildings and toss around megabillions to pull off the most progressive organized olympics ever and im disgusted because its communist government has developed such muscle in the global marketplace 1 3 billion people can have such an effect that it reduces influential executives in sports and business to cowering submissive soul selling fools
7525069 were playing good baseball again weve just got to keep going cant sit
7525070 since valentines day is for a christian saint and were jewish
7525071 will god get mad at me for giving someone a valentine
7525072 no i dont think god would get mad who do you want to give a valentine to
7525073 i thought that if a little american jewish boy could have enough love to give osama a valentine he might start to think that maybe were not all bad and maybe start loving people a little bit and if other kids saw what i did and sent valentines to osama hed love everyone a lot and then hed start going all over the place to tell everyone how much he loved them and how he didnt hate anyone anymore
7525074 and once that gets him out in the open the marines could blow the shit out of him
7525075 my dog and cat have taught me a great lesson in life learn to shed a lot
7525076 im one of the members of our congress who is dedicated to energy independence for our country our continent
7525077 the idea is what can we do individually and together to make our continent a better place
7525078 if our automotive industry is in distress why cant we retool some of those factories
7525079 to be standing today with all these people with fascinating backgrounds and dynamic leadership i can tell you its a thrill
7525080 lets make sure this is not the first and only time we meet to ensure this future takes place
7525081 i think rossendale has not quite understood that climate change is a serious problem and they have responsibilities to do something about it
7525082 they have targets for renewable energy and have failed to demonstrate they care they have a target
7525083 in my opinion this is a local council saying sorry it is not our problem
7525084 we do not believe the benefits of carbon reductions will be outweighed by the harmful impact to the local environment and community if an area of deep peat is disturbed
7525085 the whole development site is also underlain by mine shafts some charted and some unknown any attempts to grout up or cement pile voids could have a knock on effect on the spring water supplies to dwellings in the area

7525091 abry is one of the most experienced private equity firms in the media communications and information industry
7525092 we believe they are the right partner to continue our aggressive growth plans while providing outstanding service to our valued customers
7525093 what do i make of her brothers book i dont think it would be intelligent to comment but youd be hard pushed to be a homophobe and marry madonna
7525094 they can hit anywhere in the city and you have a higher visibility
7525095 there will be plenty of officers patrolling the streets around the street fair looking for those people who are driving while intoxicated
7525096 weve just had no consultation no notification its just appeared on the grass beyond the athletics track
7525097 if it stays there i just cant see how the rugby league are going to let us play at the ground again because it makes such a noise and it affects the flight of the ball when you think that its a local authority funded stadium that acts as the base for some top quality athletes as well i just cant believe the council would do something like this
7525098 its pretty much glued to the side of the track with only a bit of grass in between
7525099 we have about 500 athletes who train four or five nights a week but i dont know how youngsters are going to react when there is a loud buzzing noise from a wind turbine im as green as the next person but i cant believe the best place to put it in the whole of leeds is next to an athletics track
7525100 we have felt for sometime that the local authority have not been supportive of us
7525101 the club will fight this issue as long as we have breath in our lungs
7525102 weve been informed by wakefield that their salary cap wont allow them to enter negotiations
7525103 we have not abandoned our plans to pursue that project
7525104 were still interested in building a wind farm there it may be scaled back a bit from what we were proposing but it will still be a very good wind farm
7525105 were no different than a lot of other developers that are moving ahead with things but dont have a contract at this point
7525106 were continuing on with things like assessment work in the background when the time is appropriate well announce specifically what were going to do

7525110 the speaker has been an advocate for increasing our countrys energy independence and for renewable energy for years long before this purchase
7525111 the ethics rules are so incredibly narrow that unless you are pushing or voting for something that will impact only you it doesnt count as a conflict
7525112 will increase the use of natural gas which is abundant clean and cheap
7525113 we believe clean energy stands to benefit from the momentum generated from energy issues coming to the forefront in the u s
7525114 there is proposed legislation in congress promoting natural gas as a transportation fuel and we are seeing an increasing number of grants providing incentives to switch to natural gas fueling solutions
7525115 no 2 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
7525116 if you want it for art and decoration thats fine but for achieving any kind of power thats useful its not a very good idea and i dont know of anywhere thats done it very successfully
7525117 they can help just like biofuels can help just like tides can help in the end it is conservation that is the main thing you and i can do and that we can do in this city

7525146 unfortunately we suffered with a reliability problem which lost us precious points now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react
7525147 clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races
7525148 now we must continue to push to the maximum to develop the car and improve reliability in order to be as well prepared as possible for the forthcoming races

7525154 it is unethical and impermissible to change the rules in the middle of an election to benefit the mayor and the council who are the ones drafting and enacting the legislation

7525163 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7525164 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7525165 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil

7525167 cheerleading is unique because unlike other sports where kids are required to be fast fit and ferocious in addition the girls are also expected to be perky cute and thin not unlike a beauty pageant
7525168 aggressive or mean moms are not unlike typical stage parents who push their kid into show business
7525169 that doesnt mean they pressure their kids to cheer but if the mother had an unhappy childhood or wasnt popular in high school she may want her daughter to experience what happiness she didnt
7525170 these moms feel pressure for their daughters to perform and the teen rivalry by extention of their kids and become overprotective
7525171 except these moms take it to the extreme which only compounds any pressure girls feel and can ultimately make their daughters more aggressive and competitive not unlike a bully
7525172 that said not every mother of a cheerleader has the potential to become out of control
7525173 if your daughter wants to cheer a parent should encourage that as long as the elements of competition are kept in check
7525174 the key is to make sure girls are well rounded in their interests do they love cheering well thats great do they have other interests and a healthy self esteem lets hope so

7525238 in designing this pico projector with the use of led illumination and the chip along with other components weve engineered it to last longer
7525239 you want to use the cell phone so you dont want it to take up all its power using the projector
7525240 so by designing it to last at least an hour and a half it allows our customers to manufacture a very useable device
7525241 we texas instruments have created systems that are so low powered they can sample sensors and transmit information wireless without the need of a battery and they will last forever
7525242 wouldnt it be great to have a smoke alarm where you never change the batteries and it wasnt plugged into the mains
7525243 it would be wherever you wanted to put it and if you scavenge energy correctly that smoke alarm can actually talk to other alarms
7525244 so when one goes off and your bedroom doors closed the one in your bedroom can also go off
7525245 this just from the energy that can be scavenged from a normal household environment from the light vibrations temperature and such

7525249 like many people i am passionate about alternative health and medicine but found no modern reliable websites with current news or information that helped me research homeopathic remedies or get the latest information i need on a regular basis since webmd doesnt provide the timely articles or information about alternative health solutions i wanted we decided to create the worlds first web 2 0 alternative health community
7525250 we want to give people the opportunity to learn about alternative health solutions instead of relying solely on western medicine or drugs
7525251 health is personal people go online to search for health information thats particular to whatever is ailing them so we also wanted to give people the opportunity to share their health stories whether its in a video article essay natural cure or in our forums
7525252 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7525253 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7525254 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7525255 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7525256 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7525257 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7525258 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7525259 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7525260 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7525261 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

7525264 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7525265 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7525266 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7525267 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7525268 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7525269 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7525270 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7525271 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7525272 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7525273 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7525274 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7525275 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7525276 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7525277 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7525278 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7525279 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7525280 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7525281 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7525282 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7525283 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7525284 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7525285 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7525286 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7525287 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7525288 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7525289 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7525290 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7525291 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7525292 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7525293 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7525294 who are open to doing something on the production side
7525295 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7525296 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7525297 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7525298 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7525299 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7525300 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7525301 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7525302 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7525303 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7525304 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7525305 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7525306 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7525307 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7525308 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7525309 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7525310 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7525311 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7525312 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7525313 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7525314 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7525315 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7525316 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7525317 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7525318 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7525319 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7525320 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7525321 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7525322 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7525323 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7525324 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7525325 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7525326 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7525327 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7525328 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7525329 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7525330 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7525331 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7525332 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7525333 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7525334 pump up your shot gut and douse me with glitter
7525335 we all have the same egyptian blood and if the purpose of the measure is to prohibit the traffic of organs we reject it because that could occur as well among the faithful of the same religion
7525336 it was thanks to him that the fire did not spread any further
7525337 i was amazed ive never seen him move so fast hes the last person youd expect to have such a lightning reaction to anything unless it was illegal but he stopped the situation from getting any worse
7525338 while i have to admit throwing out a number like 100 000 seemed pretty overzealous after seeing how hard digital titles are to sell i still hoped we could reach that lofty goal boy did i miss the mark 7 days over 130 000 units
7525339 that may not seem impressive compared to package titles that sell in the millions but compared to other digital titles that is a friggin juggernaut
7525340 the titles of yesteryear to be paid the proper respect
7525341 the bar has been raised and you have let developers around the world know that if they invest the time money and heart into making and remaking some great games you will support that initiative
7525342 when we arrived we had a doorway on fire with fire extending all the way up the wall and into the eaves of the classic theatre
7525343 we basically caught this fire with no time to spare it was just getting ready to extend into the attic area of the theatre
7525344 had the fire spread up into the attic theres a lot of heavy timber construction up there and its in a concealed space so we would have ended up with a very serious fire we would have lost that building
7525345 we know it was deliberately set but we dont know what their motive was
7525346 was it to burn the building down kids playing or playing a prank
7525347 some kids are lighting up a piece of board on the side of a building and not thinking its going to go too far and the next thing you know the whole building is up in fire
7525348 that whole downtown area could have been up in flames
7525349 this is crazy they could have taken out the whole downtown block
7525350 there could have been lives lost or anything so its pretty serious
7525351 the fire department did an exceptionally good job in containing the fire and getting it under control quickly and theyre to be commended for that id say another 15 minutes and we would have lost the building
7525352 its very concerning to me as fire chief for somebody to attempt to burn a large building on high street
7525353 had the fire department not been called when it was and the crews not had acted as professional as they did wed be looking at a very different landscape down there
7525354 i feel very strongly that the people who are most affected directly have a right to hear that from their employers and their union representatives and not from the airwaves of the province
7525355 were very concerned about whats happening with the mill in grand falls windsor
7525356 weve had a dialogue with the union for several years now on this issue with the company we knew that the company was involved in significant restructuring and weve kept the lines of communication open with the company
7525357 weve been very supportive of the company within the last two years particularly both companies abitibi bowater and kruger in corner brook have been struggling with the downturn in the industry globally and weve been very proactive in our support for those companies
7525358 and on top of that while we dont have the exact numbers because we dont have access to the companys books we estimate that they earn over and above what they require for their own power needs within the company they earn about 6 million a year because they have hydro developments on the exploits river thats an annual benefit to the company this is significant support provided from the government to that operation
7525359 of course you want the company to succeed but when you offer up your forests and youre offering up your energy resources at the end of the day there also has to be significant return to the people of the province and particularly that people in the general area
7525360 youre always trying to achieve a balance the question that has to be answered over the next several weeks is that balance being achieved is there a better way to go
7525361 we wont be walking away from grand falls windsor good bad or undecided
7525362 i dont agree with those who say government not playing a proper role the williams government has been extremely helpful
7525363 weve got an excellent relationship with the minister and her staff and i cant say enough about how cooperative and interested they are in willing to help
7525364 it may be that montreal is making an error in their analysis of the grand falls situation and what works best maybe they should leave more to the people on the ground here
7525365 we know what newfoundland needs and what the division in particular needs
7525366 because id never written songs before we didnt know what the rules were
7525367 we didnt know you shouldnt write about the tasteless things going around in your head
7525368 this musical is coming from the mind of dana marschz the teacher and he doesnt think its funny and hes not trying to be offensive
7525369 the joke of it is that hes so damaged and hes trying to be so honest with his feelings but hes so limited with his abilities that it ends up being completely inappropriate
7525370 hes the son of god and i think thats cool
7525371 so why do i feel like ive been raped in the face
7525372 it maybe came out of frustration because we had seen so many musicals and we were trying to do something that was really funny
7525373 im not pretending these songs are as good as any musical ever
7525374 i hope people will think theyre a breath of fresh air
7525375 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7525376 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7525377 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7525378 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in europe and fighting the japanese in the pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the united states of america at the same time
7525379 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7525380 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7525381 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience
7525382 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7525383 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
7525384 doing those type of scenes is always a bit strange never mind a husband but an entire crew watching you
7525385 this was two lone wolves its a duel two complicated fascinating really brilliant people
7525386 for men with their histories their intelligence their egos a contest like this really did become kind of life and death
7525387 they say it in the piece there can be only one winner
7525388 were telling it while hes still in office which has never been done
7525389 the bush family is a political dynasty in america its the closest thing we have to a political dynasty other than john adams and john quincy adams weve never had father and son presidents like this before
7525390 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
7525391 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
7525392 he believes hes only got a short time to live and that hes come down with this disease so hes kind of convinced hes got to get up the nerve to tell her how he feels before he dies
7525393 it has similar demands to catalunya it is more asymmetric than brno but not as asymmetric as other motogp tracks like valencia and phillip island
7525394 last year the asphalt was new but it wasnt as aggressive as many other new surfaces we have experienced in motogp though it was quite bumpy
7525395 the most asymmetric section is from turn ten to turn 14 five consecutive right handers with the riders staying on the right side of the tires and braking into four successively slower right handers from turn 11 to turn 14
7525396 while managing stress and grip on the right side of both the front and the rear tires we need to deliver grip and good warm up on the left side especially for turn 15 and turn 16 which follow that run of right handers
7525397 there are a lot of slower speed corner exits at misano so you need good rear traction the track isnt too demanding on the rear tire so the range of rears is again similar to that which we use at catalunya medium to medium hard with different compounds on each side according to misanos asymmetric layout
7525398 based on our results it is clearly not worth using embedded images in your emails all you will be doing is forcing people to download encoded images that they will not be able to view
7525399 the board have accepted the bid hes not renegotiated his contract and the decision was taken out of my hands
7525400 i dont know where anton is in terms of signing for sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on
7525401 we are thin on the ground and if we lose another defender we will have to react to that
7525402 one of the reasons scotland didnt take to lady thatcher was because of that we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
7525403 oh you work in parliament so are you a conservative
7525404 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident we are out to make up for 2007 misano is so close to my home town of tavullia that i know there will be an army of italian fans there and i hope its going to be a great party for all of them last year there was some terrible weather before the race as well so i really hope that this year we have sunshine and we can enjoy a fantastic race by the sea
7525405 after the disaster of brno im going to misano with the belief and the will that everything goes much better and that were able to score a positive result in my teams second home grand prix im riding well at the moment and in the post race test in the czech republic we were able to shave off a few tenths that will be vital for the next gp misano is a small track for motogp but it is safe last year i won in 250cc so my only memories of it are good ones
7525406 last year we arrived in misano with a 60 point disadvantage to stoner and now we are 50 ahead so the situation is completely reversed and obviously thats great for us having said that we still have six difficult races left and there are circuits coming up where we know our rivals will be very strong misano is one of the places where last year we were not so bad so it could be one of the places we can fight it is difficult to overtake but i expect and hope for another good show valentinos targets havent changed since the start of the season the first priority is to be on the podium which is even more crucial at this stage and when possible fight to win those objectives remains the same regardless of the points situation
7525407 in the latter part of this century or the next mexicans will be a majority in many of the states and could therefore take control of the state government using the democratic process they could then secede from the united states and then we might have another civil war

7525445 foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child the rod of discipline will remove it far from him
7525446 but when the lord judges and punishes us he does it to keep us from being condemned with the rest of the world
7525447 furthermore we had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them shall we not much rather be subject to the father of spirits and live for they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them but he disciplines us for our good so that we may share his holiness all discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful but sorrowful yet to those who have been trained by it afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness

7525603 well ive actually been approved by the government to play a show
7525604 ive already sold 10 000 tickets there so i will be going to put on a concert for the fans they tend to you know sometimes not want western artists in their country i respect that but at the same time you know theres people that listen to music there and want to see their idols and stuff so its all good been approved by the government and im going to go put on a show and have fun
7525605 its true in the centre of london and in the big northern cities its linked to the new poverty
7525606 its nothing to do with famine or war quite the opposite england is one of the richest countries in the world
7525607 the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves
7525608 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours its true im going to be harsh but i think a lot of english peoples food lacks heart its bland
7525609 its true historically weve never produced wine we have a culture of alcohol and were more beer orientated the only people who drink more than us are the irish and the scottish
7525610 in the past british cuisine was similar to italian cuisine nowadays without the pasta and risotto steam cooking grilled meat herbs spices we used to cook fabulous dishes its all in the past
7525611 unlike french people and i regret it we lost our traditions in gastronomy the world evolves and changes and right in front of us isolated from everything you have france where nothing changes
7525612 its not a judgement its an observation in terms of grand restaurants it seems to me that only one country competes with france and thats japan
7525613 i dont have many but i would like to shoot a tv programme soon
7525614 the french english relationship amuses me as neighbours we criticise each other we mock each other but behind all this we appreciate each other and we respect each other

7525617 having the opportunity to test the bernina 830 at the factory in steckborn gave me a new appreciation for the ingenuity workmanship and pride that goes into the development of every bernina product every feature has been carefully thought through to develop a machine that puts the creative sewer first whether it be the ease of absolute check is hands down my favorite new feature for new and experienced embroiderers alike accurate placement of embroidery designs on a project can be a challenge absolute check makes it so easy to ensure the design will end up exactly where i want it every time
7525618 to watch the swiss team and the us team come together to make the 830 the best machine possible was amazing to me in testing you write a lot of bug reports the best part was to be able to explain and show the bug to the specific engineer responsible for that area and hearing them say oh i know what i need to fix and then to see it happen it was also a unique experience to work with the engineers who developed the new technologies on the 830 and learn from that engineer the attributes of that feature to see in detail what makes each bernina so special absolute check in embroidery i design as i go much of the time and to be able to know absolutely where each part of the design will sew out is an incredible time saver plus the precision is exact absolute check is not an approximation it is exact
7525619 being in the factory and working along side of the swiss engineers was a true honor the pride in workmanship and attention to quality and detail is clear in everything they do testing the bernina 830 was a once in a lifetime experience my favorite feature of the 830 is my freedom to choose and make the machine my own but i love the

7525687 first off i dont appreciate you calling me at work i have no comment i dont talk with the media about what i i am a private citizen i am not susceptible i have no further comment i dont know what you are up or what your agenda is so please never ever call me again at work
7525688 kita belum bicarakan soal itu cawapres kita masih bicarakan soal koalisi dulu untuk membahas masa depan bangsa ini
7525689 kita harus bersama sama memimpin untuk membangun negeri ini kita siapkan dulu koalisinya baru kita bicara siapa figur yang layak untuk jadi cawapres yang pasti cawapres kita nanti berasal dari luar pdi perjuangan
7525690 bukan hanya golkar bisa dengan partai partai lain tetapi yang penting koalisi yang kita bangun ini bertujuan untuk masa depan bangsa ini semua partai akan kita jajaki bahkan partai yang tidak menangpun kita akan jajaki
7525691 semuanya kan harus dinilai dari suara terbanyak itu kan nanti tersrah kepada rakyat kalau pak jk itu kan sudah berpengalaman mulai dari menteri sampai sekarang jadi wapres pak jk pernah pengalaman bekerja dengan mbak mega waktu jadi presiden
7525692 baitul muslimin indonesia ini ibaratnya adalah mesin cuci image seperti kata pak taufiq kiemas pdi perjuangan itu dulu sempat disebut sebagai partai tempat bercokolnya para preman atau kaum kiri nah lewat baitul muslimin hal hal negatif yang menyangkut image yang negatif itu kita cuci
7525693 peluncuran secara resmi rumah perempuan oleh ketua umum pdi perjuangan ibu hj megawati soekarnoputri ini merupakan wujud dari penegasan dan penyikapan secara politik bahwa pdi perjuangan adalah partai politik yang memberikan ruang yang sangat luas bagi kaum perempuan di bidang politik dan kemasyarakatan dengan prinsip kesetaraan jender
7525694 kebhinekaan dalam rumah besar kaum nasionalis akan terasa makin indah
7525695 sejak saya ikut dalam partai saya selalu turun ke bawah saya melihat kendala yang amat besar adalah nasib perempuan indonesia meskipun konstitusi kita telah menjabarkan jelas bahwa semua warga negara mempunyai hak yang sama meskipun kesetaraan gender telah dijamin dalam konsitusi namun hal tersebut belum dapat maksimal bukan berarti tidak jalan sudah tapi belum maksimal
7525696 kita sendiri yang harus membangun sikap itu memang bukan hal yang mudah
7525697 ini hal yang sangat strategis bagi kaum perempuan di pdi perjuangan dengan membangun suatu tempat yang diberi nama pdi perjuangan rumah perempuan
7525698 rumah perempuan ini hanya sebagai suatu simbol untuk memberikan gambaran mengenai begitu terbukanya pdi perjuangan terhadap partisipasi kaum perempuan karena pdi perjuangan adalah partai terbuka jadi artiannya siapa saja yang mau bergabung di pdi peruangan dipersilahkan masuk ke dalam rumah perempuan ini
7525699 setiap kesalahan kebijakan dampaknya selalu dirasakan duluan oleh perempuan dan anak anak
7525700 di sinilah platform perjuangan politik kader kader perempuan pdi perjuangan diformulasikan berdasarkan ideologi ad dan art pdi perjuangan keputusan partai dan agenda strategis partai
7525701 selama dua hari tersebut kader kader perempuan pdi perjuangan juga akan membangun tekad untuk menggelorakan semangan perjuangan mengobarkan militansi kader dan memperkuat soliditas kepartaian
7525702 tema ini merupakan bagian dari komitmen pdi perjuangan terhadap pentingnya kebijakan politik guna memberikan perhatian kepada ibu dan anak inilah wujud sederhana dari kepedulian kita sekaligus penyikapan atas berbagai kejadian gizi buruk ang masih menjadi ancaman serius bagi jutaan anak dan balita indonesia
7525703 karena itu seluruh kader pdi perjuangan di eksekutif dan legislatif harus mendorong kebijakan politik khususnya melalui politik anggaran untuk memberikan jaminan atas kesehatan ibu dan anak indonesia
7525704 kini seluruh kader perepuan pdi perjuangan siap sedia untuk melanjutkan perjuangan kaum perempuan indonesia dala perspektif politik sosial budaya dan ekonomi melalui gerakan kepartaian
7525705 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all men the testimony given in its proper time
7525706 now when the apostles who were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent peter and john to them who when they had come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy spirit
7525707 give me this power also that anyone on whom i lay hands may receive the holy spirit
7525708 your money perish with you because you thought that the gift of god could be purchased with money you have neither part nor portion in this matter for your heart is not right in the sight of god repent therefore of this your wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you for i see that you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity
7525709 pray to the lord for me that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me
7525710 consider the nations of the pacific rim consider the sweatshops of developing countries where countless thousands suffer under the oppressive yoke of forced labor and little pay fueled by american greed and materialism
7525711 prevents christians from performing their gospel requirements of feeding the hungry clothing the naked and visiting the sick
7525712 understands religion can play a significant role in the life of people in cuban society and even in helping international relations
7525713 during this time its going to be hard to believe i have had over 1 000 meetings with people all around the world on this subject of our broadening our commitment to global evangelical relationships
7525714 i am more thrilled to say to you today that all around the world there is appreciation and thanksgiving for your initiative as southern baptists to expand our relationships in fact not only is it overwhelmingly appreciated it is clearly said they believe it is extremely timely that we have moved to this place
7525715 the church is not a business not an experiment not a product to be sold it is an outpost of the kingdom a sign of things to come in christs sovereign rule which is now hidden but will be made open and public then all the world will bow before him in recognition of who he is
7525716 all the categories of biblical theology must be kept in mind simultaneously to inform the christian worldview
7525717 to take all legal steps necessary to restore the five agencies to their former legal relationship
7525718 at the meeting a trustee asked if selling some of windermeres property was an active consideration mallory responded that property would not be sold because to do so would disrupt development plans
7525719 windermere baptist conference center will sell some property as part of its long range strategic plan
7525720 being with these young people is so refreshing because you can see in them that they are truly excited about christianity and are really striving to live humble and broken lives in the lord
7525721 they made a group on facebook where they have been able to talk and stay in touch since last year
7525722 because of that the students have made lasting friendships that didnt end when the tour was over and everybody seemed excited about going on the tour again
7525723 to be perfectly honest there is not one dud in the group
7525724 from what ive seen every one of the choir members have great voices that they consciously use every night to honor god
7525725 in our devotional time we talk about worship and how its done in the bible
7525726 we have also heard a lot about our attitudes for worship and how it directly influences our personal worship as well as others worship especially if were leading them
7525727 memorization is important because if you mumble a lot up there or youre not confident in what youre singing the audience is going to pick up on it and it wont be as effective
7525728 yes we ask them to memorize the material so they can better engage their audience
7525729 they need to have that eye contact to make it a real spiritual experience actually an almost physical one its necessary to take down those walls and let worship really take place
7525730 we want to come away knowing that both our audience and our performers received a real taste of worship
7525731 its so great to get to know and become close with the other choir members the adult leaders and even with our nightly host home families
7525732 but at the same time its really hard to say good bye when its over you get so close in that weeks time i know ill just be bawling
7525733 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches

7525762 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7525763 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7525764 its about loving your neighbor like the good samaritan did in the story the good neighbor is the one showing mercy and our prayer our goal is to be a church who is willing to show love and mercy with no ulterior motives
7525765 but mainly we see it as an opportunity to help parents be real heroes to their kids
7525766 the parents are the ones who decide to bring them here to get them all their necessary school supplies
7525767 i think when people think of branson they think of the glitz and the shows and the brand new beautiful branson landing
7525768 they are surprised to find out that there is actually a high percentage of homelessness in branson its expensive to live here
7525769 what was great was that kits for kidz sent us example kits and backpacks that we were then able to present to potential sponsors so they knew exactly what they were buying when they donated
7525770 we used to do a block party where we had 300 400 and eventually 500 people come out and enjoy our free entertainment and activities in the church parking lot
7525771 but for those who are lost or dont have a church home the church parking lot is not considered a safe place to be its about as uncomfortable for them as it would be for a christian to go to a bar it made sense to move the bash to a more neutral site
7525772 we also had about 25 people trained in the sharing jesus without fear study
7525773 their whole purpose at the bash was to go out and start conversations and interact with the people who come we came out earlier and prayed over the field and our desire for the spirit to move in this place we have been intentional in that way
7525774 events like these help us grow closer as a church and help us to come together while we are also helping others
7525775 we just want to love people to christ and then help them grow in that love
7525776 defend a central point on the screen with your mouse
7525777 its important to take god seriously and not take yourself too seriously
7525778 most people dont include the lord in their life all the world was in business before i showed up and will still be functioning long after im gone
7525779 i think it makes it easier i dont have to wake up every morning and wonder what im going to believe today it releases you from tension and struggle
7525780 the most important issue facing america is how we treat each other and our respect for the sanctity of life
7525781 it took women 150 years to get the right to vote it took people of color 200 years to come to a place of acceptance
7525782 i am convinced with all my heart that god almighty gave us this land and capacity to survive because we had elevated human life what a magnificent elevation and celebration of the human spirit
7525783 we believe in no soldier left behind we risk able bodied men and thousands of dollars of equipment to rescue a wounded soldier his value is not in his function but in his person
7525784 its not causing people to be angry its causing people to think it is this type of approach that is reducing the number of abortions in cities where vitae is advertising
7525785 it is saving human life it is elevating human life
7525786 if you believe that your own life has value how can you devalue another person
7525787 i wont rule out making another race sometime right now im focusing on helping senator john mccain get elected
7525788 i dont think senator lieberman would be a good choice republicans want a republican i dont know that he would be a good fit to be vice president
7525789 its got to be somebody hes comfortable with somebody to help him get his message out hes pro life he does support traditional marriage and the sanctity of human life his opponent does not
7525790 how wonderful people are i came away encouraged by what i saw in people
7525791 running for president wasnt nearly as brutal or savage as anything i ran for in arkansas
7525792 the person being disciplined almost immediately in the process admitted that he had failed to live by the teachings of the covenant that he had signed
7525793 he knew that he had violated the promise the commitment that he had made to the body sadly he was put out of the body we still pray for him
7525794 the real issue is not having a covenant but the real issue is using a covenant
7525795 and you will use a covenant either more or less depending on your seriousness about regenerate church membership
7525796 the idea of a covenant is very much a part of what were talking about
7525797 churches if they want to be healthy there has to be a standard there has to be a sense of this is who we are an identification if you want to identify as a part of the body of christ then there are some expectations
7525798 i find people everywhere who are discouraged about business as usual and actually the seeker sensitive stuff has become business as usual
7525799 its not producing a really healthy church in many cases its not healthy because its mainly filled with non believers so i think the first issue of health is to deal with who are the believers and try to have a regenerate church membership
7525800 weve got to be able to walk that tightrope and allow the holy spirit to lead us in this
7525801 weve got to have standards weve got to have expectations
7525802 wise pastors in those countries are unhappy with western methods that are coming over
7525803 were transporting all this methodology that weve had thats really produced a very unhealthy church
7525804 church is the one place where we expect the least out of people and you get what you expect a lot of times
7525805 thats why we are dealing with over half of our folks not even showing up on sunday morning and thats a base measurement of whether they are committed or not
7525806 according to the needs of the hour according to the conflicts we face
7525807 it fits with james when he talks about if youre a christian your life should measure up in certain ways
7525808 its hard to measure love and yet paul puts love at the top of the list every time in each of the new testament books
7525809 he keeps coming back to this issue of love being the supreme thing so really in gods mind what is a great church a great church is a church that loves
7525810 this morning july 22 i was with these men and they were all saying ive never been in a church like this where people loved each other like this where you have such a unity in the body thats not measurable on a piece of paper but it certainly is known by the people who are experiencing it
7525811 theres something very valuable about the process of coming up with a church covenant that drives it home to the people
7525812 i would suggest that pastors and some key people come together intentionally to study the whole issue of what needs to be put in a church covenant by reviewing many church covenants and weighing what they believe is best
7525813 it brings together then the true members at least purifies the church considerably
7525814 quit being pragmatic and look at what god requires the church to be
7525815 god might call a church healthy but some church growth specialist might not
7525816 were really doing a very big disservice to people who are not believers to keep them on our rolls its not loving and its almost aiding and abetting their sin
7525817 weve focused more on the external than helping people truly become transformed
7525818 why cant all new yorkers treat arabs muslims and south asian with respect love trust and compassion

7525830 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7525831 its reasonable to discuss already today the transdniestr problem i see good chances for solving it
7525832 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7525833 this is a serious warning for us all it is in this context that we should view the question of transdniestr resolution
7525834 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia
7525835 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7525836 almost immediately after the czech republic signed an agreement with the us to place missile defense tracking radar in its territory oil supplies through the druzhba pipeline to the central european country were reduced to a trickle ostensibly for technical reasons
7525837 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia
7525838 degrade and burn up on rentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
7525839 if anything at all in that five years period goes wrong with the russian soyuz then we have no system to access the space station
7525840 while it is possible that government to government issues could potentially have an impact on other aspects of a relationship between nations including cooperative space exploration activities nasa believes that it will be able to rely upon roscosmos provided soyuz vehicles for future space station activities
7525841 as long as russia can be said to be abiding by the terms of the cease fire in georgia
7525842 there is an issue but i dont think its so strong to prevent the waiver from passing as long as russian behavior is what it has been agreed to on georgia

7525852 hoping to become more than a regional service provider singtel wants to be able to match up to gsps global service providers in terms of providing a comprehensive ict service portfolio by acquiring scs singtel now has the support from both ncs and scs to help provide it services to its customers
7525853 the long term trend is that a lot of the service providers bt orange business services at amp t verizon business provide more of consultative type of selling going into professional services and some limited form of it services for example managed services be it manage ppx manage security or managed application monitoring so in that sense the competition has become a lot tougher and clearly singtel has to add some form of it services capability to it
7525854 in the telecoms industry we do not see any immediate benefits from a telecoms services provider merging or coming closer together with an it service company there are many pitfalls of combining the convergence of telecoms and it
7525855 firstly the culture of these two industries are different in the sense that the profit margins of an it service company tend to be much slower than that of a service telecom provider which will be much lower than that of a telecom service provider and the time to reap the profit tends to be longer as well

7526164 i pray to a loving god that he bless and protect them

7526213 massachusetts has been a leader in expanding health insurance for all of its citizens and now we are focused on meeting the needs of every child
7526214 this law continues our commitment to providing every child with access to mental health care with the same certainty and dedication that we provide medical care
7526215 this new law will help children suffering from depression and mental illness get the kind of treatment they need and deserve treatment that is the key to preventing physical harm and suicide
7526216 i am so pleased that together we have been able to do so much this session for those suffering from depression and mental illness and thank my partners governor patrick and senate president murray for their focus with the house on these important issues
7526217 there are too many children in the commonwealth who go undiagnosed or untreated for mental illness
7526218 this new law will help seal the cracks in our system with increased screenings for early diagnosis and streamlined services for all massachusetts children including more than 100 000 who are currently not receiving the care they need with these efforts we hope to reduce suicides and other hardships brought on by mental illness and ensure that children and their families have the best opportunity to live happy healthy lives
7526219 this bill is an important step toward ensuring that the commonwealth has a system of care both public and private that is responsive to the needs of children with mental health problems
7526220 once again massachusetts leads the way in building a world class system of health care
7526221 today with the governors signature we move closer to providing the children of the commonwealth with access to a mental health system that is high quality accessible and cost effective
7526222 there are far too many of the commonwealths children living with undiagnosed or untreated mental illness these children and their families have to struggle with a fragmented system to receive the services they desperately need this bill will streamline the agencies responsible for their care and maximize each childs overall outcome most importantly it will provide them with much needed support and assistance
7526223 the mbta has the infrastructure and technology to deliver amber alert messages to hundreds of thousands of people instantaneously
7526224 we often urge our customers to say something if they see something and heres another opportunity to do so and help a child

7526226 it only makes sense that the mbta with more than 1 3 million riders a day be an active participant in this important law enforcement program
7526227 we dont ever feel satisfied with our current media mix and are constantly looking to optimize either by improving response or reducing cost or both

7526269 lewis and nicole are getting pretty serious theyre almost living in each others pockets as it is but were hearing that they may be about to buy a place together it would only be a part time base because lewis is based in switzerland
7526270 the fact they are planning to get a place shows how serious theyve become

7526273 there is a distinct public interest in putting this issue on the agenda to demonstrate the dangers of what could occur during psychological therapy
7526274 the special relationship that is formed between patient and psychiatrist and the dependence that could grow from it which could result in abuse merit examination
7526275 increase awareness and prompt victims to come forward and complain to the authorities or seek compensation
7526276 deter other therapists from crossing lines and boundaries thereby sparing other patients future transgressions
7526277 sexual and erotic contact between a therapist and a patient seeking psychological therapy is strictly forbidden and constitutes a grave ethical transgression and patient abuse which could irrevocably damage the patients mental health
7526278 those who were treated by dr kafri in the past are entitled to know about this case
7526279 we managed to viciously hurt one another we were both very frivolous we tried to ignore it and then it hit us when we werent expecting it i had to put an end to it at some point because i saw what huge damage it was causing both of us

7526289 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7526290 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7526291 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7526292 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7526293 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7526294 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7526295 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7526296 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7526297 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits

7526301 when i say that i want to make the chicago symphony orchestra a greater part of the life of chicago and to bring it to new audiences i do not mean just to persuade the children of the current subscribers that it is their turn to buy tickets
7526302 work with musicians and orchestras of the highest level but be away from the noise including the mental noise of a big city
7526303 when people heard me say in chicago i want to take the orchestra to play in a prison they thought ah muti is joking but i was not joking and i am not joking music serious music the music of this orchestra must be for everyone
7526304 get me a copy of this address please i must read this
7526305 we live in an age when we need sponsors and donors et cetera fortunately with the administration of this festival one can also have real conversations about real topics
7526306 i am here in salzburg 38 years my children grew up summers and winters in this house which we built here like ravenna italy site of the mutis main home it is a place where i can work and work with musicians and orchestras of the highest level but be away from the noise including the mental noise of a big city where else can someone work on a new production of verdis german requiem and all with the vienna philharmonic without having to fly from here to there to here
7526307 verdi was a composer this means he wrote music he was not a circus master or the proprietor of a wax museum i want people to hear what verdi what any composer actually wrote
7526308 you see what happens when you actually study the score
7526309 there are recordings by him that you hear and wonder how does he do this how does he get this sound this shine you could say but then you listen to several recordings of several pieces and you wonder why do they

7526312 while i have to admit throwing out a number like 100 000 seemed pretty overzealous after seeing how hard digital titles are to sell i still hoped we could reach that lofty goal boy did i miss the mark 7 days over 130 000 units
7526313 that may not seem impressive compared to package titles that sell in the millions but compared to other digital titles that is a friggin juggernaut
7526314 the titles of yesteryear to be paid the proper respect

7526320 the recent decline in fuel prices and the decision by the central bank to leave interest rates on hold is a positive step but it is too premature to conclude that inflationary pressures are over
7526321 if international fuel prices remain weaker in the next two to three months we expect further reductions in local fuel prices and inflation will certainly come down assuming food prices also remain stable
7526322 we expect the august inflation rate to rise but at a decreasing rate
7526323 depending on how the levy is implemented it could add to inflationary preasures
7526324 rising imports and slower export growth have wiped out positive trade balance in six months to may 2008 there is no immediate problems from worsening balance of trade because we have an import cover for approximately 24 months

7526329 coalition parties have agreed to go for a referendum if turkeys accession talks are concluded in favour of a decision to prepare a membership agreement
7526330 and they have a good reason for that turkeys membership will bring a new dimension to the european integration and the eu
7526331 the robinho thing is a personal problem of his and i only hope that it can be resolved quickly
7526332 i cannot say whether or not it is good or bad and i can only think that i hope that things can be sorted out in a way that is best for both him and the club
7526333 i have never seen a game like that in my life before it will certainly go down as one of the most incredible games in history
7526334 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in
7526335 a solution in agreement with the irish government in october or in december
7526336 acceptance of the irish refusal has now become admittedly thin
7526337 i wrote that song no 1 fan as a stalker it was raining and i was sitting there in front of the house watching her come home from a date after we were divorced
7526338 tremendous quantities of food are discarded in processing transport supermarkets and peoples kitchens
7526339 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion litres of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
7526340 weak policy poor management increasing waste and exploding water demands are pushing the planet towards the tipping point of global water crisis
7526341 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7526342 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7526343 they generally seem to despise those in the public eye but still bestow knighthoods on famous faces
7526344 there is almost a contempt for success in the national character a lampooning of celebrity a tradition of putting it down
7526345 but just when you think theyre ignoring you to the point of disdain the government and the queen suddenly say actually we rather like you and give you a knighthood its the most delicious and wonderful balance which happens nowhere else in the world
7526346 i think its great being less famous i blame the fact i had shall we say a meeting with russell crowe i had never seen or heard such bad press about me here and its been great in a funny kind of way and you know a good thing too because i now realise the world does not revolve around me
7526347 tim pawlenty is like a skipper of a ship thats in rocky seas
7526348 things have gone kind of haywire in the water but somehow hes able to keep a pretty steady level of support among minnesotans during a period when there are some real challenging and a period in which the campaigns are clearly starting to pick up speed and become a little rougher
7526349 what were seeing is that carol molnau would have her hands full in building and enjoying the confidence of minnesotans and of obviously the legislature
7526350 it appears that she would come in as a fairly weak governor and one who will face some real challenges she is not tim pawlenty
7526351 its a position thats a little more behind the scenes so the people of minnesota and i think the poll reflects that theres still a pretty large percentage of minnesotans that dont really have an opinion or dont feel they know her well enough to state
7526352 they are also i think reacting to the fact that weve had two very productive legislative sessions where weve focused on issuers like energy independence the economy jobs education and health care
7526353 and its pretty clear from the poll that minnesotans trust democrats to deal with these issues
7526354 if you took the top 25 to 30 races in the state i think youd see were doing very well
7526355 our polling data shows we are doing well in the races that are competitive
7526356 and the banks need to change their people for example many banks made huge investments in crm thats the easy part the technology what they really need to do is change their people by taking all the inefficiencies and non value added services and processes from the branch so that tellers can listen to the customers once transaction oriented tellers start to listen they ask questions and these questions bring opportunities for the bank
7526357 you want to move from being transaction driven to a cross selling channel so banks need to try to reengineer their operations by taking out the waste
7526358 you have to change the behaviors culture and processes and keep tweaking
7526359 it might even mean having to let go or reassign some branch managers because they dont have the skills set to operate like this
7526360 these tools can increase sales by allowing the bank to set targets on things like quality or how quickly a loan is opened youre getting your people to perform against key performance indicators youre holding them accountable
7526361 this sizable order reinforces the continued value the u s government places on our proprietary z backscatter vans for critical counterterrorism missions
7526362 sim o jornal da era industrial est a morrer mas o que morre apenas o de papel como hoje o conhecemos dar lugar a um novo modelo
7526363 yes the industrial age newspaper is dying but what dies is the one made out of paper as we know it today it will give place to a new model
7526364 click on the image below to enlarge the whole comic
7526365 we held earlier primaries and we have strong candidates in all the six wards in the constituency
7526366 i think my track record in parliament puts me in a better stead than in 2004
7526367 they appear not to regard me as a legitimate mp for the area
7526368 it appears the gcc does not have a masterplan for the city
7526369 motswaledi is one of the artilleries that they will throw in gaborone central they would also pump financial resources in their campaign i have no doubt that the bdp would like to see me out of parliament
7526370 i will allow young people especially to agitate with me for a world class transformation in how we approach and implement governments social and economic initiatives i am also aware of the expectation among gaborone people that they believe their voice is important and so is their conscience in the shaping of our nations policy in general these are some of the issues that the people of gaborone are expecting me or any leader for that matter to tackle in particular it is what people told me during my prolonged tour of the constituency over the last few months
7526371 we are going to the elections so that the people of gaborone can exercise their right to choose their preferred candidate who they rate highly in their eyes the electorate tells me that i will be their true mp and leader if i spend more time with them listening to them and putting more focus on constituency matters this is what they have asked of me and that is what i will do
7526372 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7526373 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7526374 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
7526375 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
7526376 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won
7526377 stands for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
7526378 every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
7526379 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
7526380 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
7526381 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
7526382 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7526383 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7526384 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7526385 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7526386 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7526387 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
7526388 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
7526389 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
7526390 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state
7526391 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
7526392 russian tanks rolling through georgia with images of chechnya in 1994 and 99 vilnius 91 afghanistan 79 prague 68 hungary 56 and before that poland the baltics and other eastern european states
7526393 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
7526394 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
7526395 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7526396 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7526397 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7526398 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7526399 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7526400 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia
7526401 the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
7526402 any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
7526403 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
7526404 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
7526405 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7526406 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7526407 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7526408 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7526409 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7526410 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7526411 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7526412 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7526413 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7526414 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7526415 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7526416 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks
7526417 to deter looters and the transportation of arms and ammunition
7526418 the eurasian corridor pipeline geopolitics and the new cold war

7526426 we think we can prevent a problem that could have as much impact as the s amp l crisis
7526427 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
7526428 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7526429 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats
7526430 the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7526431 you can tell the hillary clinton people they never take the buttons
7526432 i told her i never said that she may have misunderstood
7526433 that was not that was not thats all i have to say
7526434 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7526435 it is strange but true for truth is always strange stranger than fiction
7526436 you cannot unify the continent by decree you can pass a resolution to unify a continent
7526437 for example we do not have an ideal textbook definition of a democratic system
7526438 in egypt we didnt choose anwar sadat we didnt choose mubarak and we are not choosing the next one
7526439 is widely heralded today among egyptian officials only continued political stability safeguards this legacy
7526440 wishing to leave his imprint as the one who succeeded in bringing about the stabilisation of the political arena mubarak might hope that his potential successor will arise out of this more open political climate where worthy candidates can compete for positions of power
7526441 we take it as a given that it will be gamal
7526442 people dont know who he gamal mubarak is we only know hes the presidents son and hes imposed on us
7526443 the practice of political anointment by outgoing leaders is undemocratic outdated and unacceptable
7526444 i am not waiting to be handpicked or pushed by anyone it is the people who will push me
7526445 it is slightly absurd for a party with socialist roots such as swapo the ruling south west african peoples organisation to propose turning namibia into a monarchy by installing uutoni nujoma as a successor to the throne after his father
7526446 indications are that the former president is opposed to pohamba serving a second term
7526447 his first born will be allowed to carry on the nujoma family name inside the party
7526448 as a relatively young man in his early 50s uutoni must know what is being planned for him maybe he will be the president in 2020
7526449 we think the logistics of getting such a deal done are very challenging particularly with amds equity value and cash position falling everyday after all why would a firm want to do a deal with amd today when it can just wait a little longer and do the deal even cheaper

7526477 isso n o podia ser um fato casual fiquei interessada em compreender o que levou a essa defasagem desde ent o entrevistamos muitas brasileiras que participaram das olimp adas e come amos a ter resultados que nos colocam diante de quest es muito particulares do esporte feminino no pa s
7526478 as mulheres j foram privadas por lei de participar de determinadas provas como lutas ou futebol as delega es come aram a ter um n mero equilibrado de mulheres e homens apenas em sidney em 2000
7526479 com as entrevistas estamos constatando que h uma certa acomoda o das mulheres com essa situa o elas tendem a achar natural o predom nio masculino nos jogos acham que o pr mio deles deve ser maior mesmo
7526480 estamos vendo que essa hist ria no brasil tem rela o direta com a pr pria compreens o do feminismo no pa s as lutas da mulher n o s o caracterizadas como lutas pol ticas isso se reflete na postura das atletas que n o se referem a qualquer tipo de discrimina o exceto em rela o ra a
7526481 de maneira geral o que surpreende a dificuldade das mulheres em referir discrimina o que no entanto patente queremos descobrir se fazem isso por medo de repres lias ou se h um discurso de aceita o impregnado
7526482 uma das atletas chorou durante a entrevista ao se lembrar de situa es a que se viu submetida por capricho de um dirigente que destruiu seu sonho de ir aos jogos ol mpicos mas em vez de atribuir o caso ao preconceito ela acreditava que se tratava de uma rixa pessoal
7526483 podemos avaliar o mesmo momento hist rico sendo interpretado pelo repert rio de diversas trajet rias pessoais
7526484 olhando os resultados das brasileiras nessa olimp ada conquistaram seis das 15 medalhas sendo duas de ouro e uma de prata eu diria que as mulheres est o surpreendendo isso n o quer dizer que elas ter o melhores condi es para trabalhar daqui em diante seria preciso que elas fossem tratadas pelo menos com o mesmo respeito dado ao esporte masculino que ainda assim tamb m tem muitas dificuldades
7526485 o bar o de coubertin ao instituir os jogos da era moderna em 1894 proibiu a participa o feminina argumentando que na gr cia hel nica elas eram barradas por n o serem cidad s nas olimp adas de paris em 1900 com o vigor do movimento feminista ele foi obrigado a aceitar as mulheres
7526486 em olimp adas n o h milagres acontece o bvio ganham os melhores se o brasil tem poucas medalhas em rela o a determinados pa ses porque os atletas desses pa ses est o mais bem preparados erros e derrotas dram ticas acontecem com todos mas nossos atletas tiveram um desempenho coerente com a prepara o que tiveram
7526487 we ask the pirates not to make down our teetering standard of living
7526488 the pirates caused this to us they are leading us into soreness life
7526489 the entire somali coastline is now under control of the islamists
7526490 according to our information the money they make from piracy and ransoms goes to support al shabaab activities onshore
7526491 its crazy we have never seen anything like it in our years of tracking them
7526492 theyve broken all records for piracy in this region and indeed the whole world
7526493 back in 2005 there were just five somali pirate gangs with fewer than 100 gunmen
7526494 now that youths who used to work as bodyguards for warlords or militia for the government see the rewards available at sea our estimate is that there are between 1 100 and 1 200 pirates
7526495 the explosion near undp building was beleaguered government forces were passing nearby the troops then opened fire but no injuries

7526498 are you strong enough to be my man or my president
7526499 what im hearing from sen obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy
7526500 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7526501 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7526502 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7526503 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues
7526504 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7526505 its like honey what do you want to be a pariah what do you want to be crucified its a good thing in this country we dont have to tell anybody its no ones business who we vote for
7526506 i will be able to dance i went to the hospital ill be fine
7526507 instead of fighting the natural environment the architect embraced it using the slope as the homes main characteristic the home begins at the top of the hill and slowly reveals itself as you descend down the outdoor staircase the home was designed as a vacation home for the architects cousin wife and children despite the familiar connection the home was built on a tight budget of 150 000 usd the various rooms are divided among the levels each one even has its own patio space despite the frontal exposure to the hot sun the residence is cooled by the earth which surrounds it on three sides

7526511 at one moment we could not breathe at all because our lungs were burning
7526512 i am still not convinced he is dead although he is not among the survivors
7526513 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the quranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
7526514 obama may not want to be counted as a muslim but muslims are eager to count him as one of their own
7526515 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim
7526516 he cant be a christian his middle name is hussein
7526517 the symbolism of a major american presidential candidate with the middle name of hussein who went to elementary school in indonesia
7526518 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations
7526519 exploit his background to argue that an apostate is leading the global war on terror to galvanize sympathizers into action

7526581 hard line evolutionists spend their entire life declaring christians to be ignorant crazy and probably dangerous but evolutionism is totally contrary to the empirical facts of science anyone truly believing evolution is either totally deluded or ignorant regarding who is really the dangerous
7526582 thus evolutionist rhetoric juxtaposed against the facts of science and history demonstrates that they are totally incompetent in addition to being angry and dangerous in a truly sane society e g the one to be run by god evolutionists at a minimum would not be allowed to vote
7526583 evolutionists should not be allowed to roam free in the land

7526591 we delayed his entry obviously and deferred to the blokes who had the background of test rugby first with the initial replacement option
7526592 but when timana got in the game my first instinct was that he did really well having watched it live
7526593 well have a look at the footage and pour over it and contemplate our combinations and what we believe will work for us

7526604 favoritism has no place in an obama administration i believe that all people should be able to eat in the restaurant of their choice under a single payer dining system
7526605 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character

7526612 i like it actually i think its a good idea
7526613 i think his experience makes up for the lack of obamas experience especially in foreign policy
7526614 its counterintuitive especially picking someone who has been in washington how many decades

7526626 selbstverst ndlich hoffen wir dass die vp diesen sinnvollen ma nahmen durch die die bev lkerung rasch entlastet wird zustimmt
7526627 es geht darum dass wir im sinne der menschen in sterreich notwendige und wirkungsvolle ma nahmen setzen ich nehme an dass diese dringenden anliegen die vp nicht ganz kalt lassen immerhin stehen teile der vorschl ge der sp auch innerhalb der vp au er frage sch ssel stellt die situation nun so dar als w re die vp hintergangen worden tats chlich geht es darum im sinne der bev lkerung und nicht im sinne einer partei zu handeln wenn nun aber die vp bereit ist die anti teuerungsma nahmen mitzutragen ist uns das sehr willkommen
7526628 die von finanzminister wilhelm molterer zugesagte senkung der kfz steuer auf lkw ist nicht nur in hinblick auf die eu ein wichtiger schritt zur harmonisierung von steuern und abgaben die geplante steuersenkung ist auch eine wichtige unterst tzung der sterreichischen transportwirtschaft
7526629 mit dieser ma nahme werden die europaweit h chsten kfz steuers tze auf das eu niveau reduziert und die wettbewerbsf higkeit der heimischen verkehrswirtschaft gest rkt
7526630 vizekanzler molterer hat den ernst der situation erkannt mit der zugesagten entlastung wird es gelingen die lage vieler fr chter zu verbessern und arbeitspl tze in der transportbranche zu erhalten

7526634 die abschaffung der studiengeb hren kann nur ein anfang in einer reihe von ma nahmen sein die die belastungen der studierenden mindern weiters muss auch noch eine sinnvolle nderung des universit tsgesetzes folgen

7526640 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7526641 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7526657 por esta causa y es s lo un ejemplo no hubo clases tres meses en escuelas bonaerenses pero las estad sticas no dan cuenta de esto como tampoco de los chicos que se turnan para asistir porque hay aulas en obra o de los problemas de transporte que tienen las escuelas de las islas

7526659 es hacer una recuperaci n pedag gica para dictar los contenidos principales
7526660 el tiempo es una variable muy importante en la calidad de la educaci n
7526661 hay un ritmo en la educaci n de tener clases todos los d as y de que las clases sean de tantas horas que no se recupera toqueteando los contenidos y el rendimiento escolar est directamente asociado a la exposici n escolar
7526662 todos pierden d as de clase por los mismos motivos que nos afectan explica pero al contar con un excedente de 15 20 d as tienen la posibilidad de que a n perdiendo d as su promedio se encuentre m s cerca de los 180 que de los 150 o 160 d as de clase que caracteriza a muchas provincias argentinas
7526663 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7526664 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7526665 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7526666 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7526667 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7526668 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7526669 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7526670 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7526671 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

7526676 we needed the foreign policy on the bottom of the ticket more than we want to admit
7526677 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7526678 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7526679 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7526680 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7526681 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7526682 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7526683 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7526684 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7526685 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7526686 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7526687 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7526688 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7526689 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7526690 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7526691 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7526692 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7526693 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7526694 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7526695 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7526696 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7526697 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7526698 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7526699 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7526700 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7526701 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7526702 we believe that repurchasing shares of our stock is a great use of capital that will increase earnings per share and provide returns both in the current year and should also compound in the future as we continue to grow
7526703 management has shifted its focus to total shareholder returns and not growth in revenue and earnings initially 2007 and 2008 this means divestitures of businesses that are returning less than the companys weighted average cost of capital which is 9 percent 10 percent
7526704 we believe investors dont fully understand the current health of the companys underlying core businesses despite profound demand weakness in many of leggetts key customer end markets and rampant inflation in raw material costs we believe that more than two thirds of leggetts business is in an earnings upswing
7526705 shire has advised that because the voluntary recall is not due to product safety issues all daytrana patches including those in the lots subject to the recall can continue to be used unless the release liner cannot be removed or the patches are damaged while being opened
7526706 we have identified what we believe is the definitive root cause and are aggressively testing potential solutions that we expect will address the issue
7526707 the drug is far superior to alternatives available currently which often have serious side effects are not proven to treat itp and are still very expensive
7526708 finally while senator schumers statements may have accelerated public concern about indymacs financial condition we do not believe that we can prove that they caused the banks failure
7526709 concern for the safety and soundness risks posed by indymac
7526710 while we certainly empathize with the plight of the employees their ire is better directed at the management of indymac
7526711 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again
7526712 you know i lost i lost big time in boston

7526727 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7526728 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7526729 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7526730 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7526731 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7526732 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7526733 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7526734 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7526735 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7526736 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7526737 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7526738 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7526739 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7526740 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7526741 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7526742 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7526743 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7526744 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7526745 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7526746 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7526747 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7526748 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7526749 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

7526759 it just makes me feel good to think i might help someone locate a family member
7526760 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7526761 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7526762 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7526763 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

7526817 we have developed an extremely simple iphone application that allows us to display comics that have been specifically formatted for the iphone ipod touch
7526818 what were doing is creating new comics and adapting existing comics into a format that makes reading comic books an enjoyable and easy experience on these devices
7526819 creators and studios will be able to set the final prices on their titles but were expecting most standard length titles to be around 99 and were encouraging creators to give away the first issues of their titles to allow new readers who may not be familiar with comics but are iphone ipod touch owners to give comics on the devices a try
7526820 with digital comics on the iphone ipod touch we have access to a world wide audience no printing costs or print run minimums and it doesnt take 3 months to get the title from in the catalog to on sale in a store each title will be featured as its own application in the app store and will be backed up onto the readers desktop or notebook computer each time they sync their device
7526821 if the ftc is successful in silencing daniel chapter one individual consumers seeking to improve their health and the health of american society as a whole will suffer important losses

7526823 we said that because of your strong belief about the propriety of your behavior and that of daniel chapter one you are willing and intend with our assistance to present your case for a public hearing before the ftc and if necessary in court
7526824 your deeply held convictions raise serious legal questions for the ftc and the courts first what is the nature and intent of the law the ftc seeks to enforce and how does the constitution restrain government power in enforcing that law the courts are making it increasingly clear that government must clearly identify health claim wrongs and use the least intrusive power to correct them
7526825 regulators must prove that the statements are in fact claims that they are false claims that are impossible to be true for anyone and that the defendants knew them to be false at the time they made them

7526860 however recent further price increases in raw materials have been larger than toyotas cost reduction efforts are able to offset
7526861 toyota has no other choice but to raise prices to increase its profitability
7526862 toyota will now be forced to gradually raise the prices of its other models the price hikes are expected to have a big impact on domestic sales at a time when demand in japan is already weak
7526863 all car manufacturers will increase prices its a question of time
7526864 how can you not increase prices if the price of raw materials goes up 100 percent
7526865 according to the nar 2007 profile of home buyers and sellers 48 percent of prospective buyers use open houses as a source of information and 57 percent of sellers reported that their realtor used an open house to market their property however less than 1 percent of open houses actually result in a sale
7526866 by conducting the open house over the internet the realtor can specifically target interested buyers substantially increase the virtual foot traffic that an open house creates and increase the percentage of open houses that result in a sale

7526886 then i thought it was a penalty on clinton morrison if he doesnt get pulled back then he is going to put the ball in the back of the net
7526887 we dont get the penalty i lose my temper and he sends me off fair enough maybe i deserve that for my reaction
7526888 but it wasnt just one decision that had been coming and it was decision after decision

7526895 in the process of trading up and down dramatically last week it has become clear that only one factor really matters right now
7526896 big money investors have turned oil into a proxy for the u s dollar
7526897 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7526898 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries

7526903 its clear that confidence in maple leaf and our brand has been shaken
7526904 i feel very badly about that and i regret very deeply that i cant say what the long term implications will be all i can say is how well behave in the near term if we fundamentally do the right thing and act in the interest of public health we can rebuild that confidence

7526909 it might help in the short term but in the long term it damages your reputation
7526910 age is certainly an issue but i think it is more in the minds of the individuals applying for work

7526922 we must go an order of magnitude beyond the goals of kyoto and cut our emissions 80 percent by 2050 skeptics will say that it cant be done we will show them how it can
7526923 easy for me to say that right im not going to be around in 2050 im not going to get to an 80 percent reduction but we can change the way we behave the way we live in the city this is a multigenerational partnership its going to take a long time to fix

7526929 because weve already had a referendum on this issue i think the people will have to be consulted
7526930 the government is involved in detailed research to isolate the specific matters that were most sensitive in the minds of voters as we went to the polls on 12 june those matters then have to be addressed
7526931 towards the end of the year well have to decide what our timetable is
7526932 we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people again

7526940 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7526941 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7526942 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7526943 hey i know how to get our ratings to bottom out in record time well cover up the show the audience is already tuned into by blotting out what theyre trying to see with something they have no interest in watching besides we need ads more than we need viewers
7526944 i am really looking forward to working with the kentucky delegation to make sure we have a unified front for barack obama
7526945 its important that we work hard for him because we have a lot of important races down the ballot this year

7526959 we consider this decision another step in russias fight against georgian sovereignty
7526960 it is and will be if accepted by the russian president a continuation of russian aggression against georgia and a serious violation of international law
7526961 if we put the choice in front of delegates here and voters all across this country whos going to help rebuild this economy and put your family back to work whos going keep your family safe at night whos going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil the best person to do those things isnt john mccain its barack obama
7526962 hillary clintons worked with both of these guys and shes come to the same conclusion barack obama is her guy
7526963 want a leader whos judgment and experience they can trust
7526964 when hillary clinton was clearly in the democratic primaries the woman who the person who gathered the most votes 18 million of them was a great debater and a great campaigner
7526965 we want to make sure people know exactly who senator obama is and where he wants to take the country and two that voters know their choice in this election between barack obama who wants to fundamentally change the way business is done in washington and john mccain who is just more of the same of what we have had over the course of the last eight years
7526966 hes got to be focused simple and clear rather than elegiac this is not a great novel this is a short clear focused discussion unless it is clear and real simple he has failed

7526978 its quickly becoming a very popular way to build next generation applications theres a lot of interest in capturing the hearts and minds of developers
7526979 we have a large and established customer base there is no doubt in our minds that microsoft is going after this space very aggressively but we feel very strong and confident
7526980 this is a logical extension of the investment that weve had in the development space for decades
7526981 were thrilled to have kids in positive learning environments for this first day of school
7526982 the district of columbia has opened so many school years with broken promises
7526983 someone from the top is saying that our schools will be second to none
7526984 we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation
7526985 it turns out that we dont feel or see any advantages from wto membership if they exist at all but we are carrying the burden we need to make this clear to our partners
7526986 we did a commercial sort of like high noon though im not gary cooper
7526987 we had a great actor heavyset sort of like broderick crawford giving out parking tickets and i walk on to say how bad it was that the city raised the parking and just before he writes a ticket i put a quarter in somebodys meter it was a great commercial
7526988 to change the way we do business to bring new people in talented young people not through old style politics
7526989 after the georgian leadership lost their marbles as they say all the problems got worse and a military conflict erupted
7526990 and i believe we should handle other existing conflicts in this context
7526991 we have agreed to meet and discuss the transdniestria settlement
7526992 i think there is a good reason to do this today i see good prospects of reaching a settlement
7526993 russia is ready to continue its efforts towards finally solving the transdniestrian crisis
7526994 thank god during all these years we had enough brains and reserve not to allow a similar deterioration of situation
7526995 frozen conflicts are a real volcano which can blow up anytime
7526996 that is why taking into account what had happened elsewhere it would be useful if we exercised again such wisdom not to allow such things to repeat in our country
7526997 the were rebuilding card is easy to play right here well lets face it its going to be easy to play all year but i dont think it adequately explains what happened

7527007 will forever be remembered in this region as the day that changed millions of lives were working as one community to restore our beloved city and all the richness of its culture but in the midst of this historic undertaking to move toward a better future we cannot and must not forget those who lost their lives in the storms and floods its in this spirit of reflection that we continue to move with great determination to secure the resources and funding needed to fully rebuild our city
7527008 the economic justification for the ndp and the m3 has evaporated with the economic downturn and it is economic suicide to carry on as if nothing has happened
7527009 fianna f il mindlessly propped up by the green party and the progressive democrats have clearly made a lot promises to their supporters in the building trade that they feel cannot be undone no matter what logic it defies or what damage it does to the economy as a whole
7527010 we are demanding truly sustainable development not the corrupted version we are being fed at the moment that is harming rather than improving society as a whole
7527011 omg you are still sleeping its already 3pm for gods sake you are so lazy such a pig etc etc

7527013 the problem for domestic companies is that they now lag further behind their foreign counterparts
7527014 this is not going to be helpful as the big three will lose more pricing power and be forced to continue dependence on rebates and discounting in a market where consumer preferences keep shifting away from domestic cars
7527015 the american consumer has long been the single biggest force propping up the us and the global economy
7527016 but declining customer satisfaction combined with weaker demand for us exports may make it difficult for american households to shoulder the burden of being the locomotive for world economic growth
7527017 many analysts have predicted that tech companies will be among the winners during the current economic slowdown and these q2 results bear that out
7527018 highly anticipated new products solid revenues and earnings reports major acquisitions and major investments in wireless and mobile technology all helped tech companies reap extensive positive media coverage

7527039 are you strong enough to be my man or my president
7527040 what im hearing from sen obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy
7527041 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7527042 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7527043 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7527044 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues
7527045 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7527046 its like honey what do you want to be a pariah what do you want to be crucified its a good thing in this country we dont have to tell anybody its no ones business who we vote for

7527052 it was like it snowed during and after the tornado

7527060 obviously there was a chance he might tag i just didnt get my feet under me to get the ball in i couldnt get my feet set under me to make a strong throw
7527061 able to recognize importance of sundays game and somehow keep his cool enough to not get thrown out
7527062 its going to be for some of us but for a lot of us no
7527063 as far as im concerned social security does not exist for me
7527064 so if youre 20 years old in your mid 20s and youre beginning to work i want you to think about a social security system that will be flat bust bankrupt unless the united states congress has got the willingness to act now
7527065 and thats what were here to talk about a system that will be bankrupt
7527066 i went there because im trying to make a point about the social security trust
7527067 there is no trust fund just ious that i saw firsthand that future generations will pay theyre stacked in a filing cabinet imagine the retirement security for future generations is sitting in a filing cabinet
7527068 i have no doubt that social security will be there for a couple generations
7527069 looking at the numbers right now social security is one of the most financially sound programs that we have in the federal budget
7527070 financial advisors keep on telling you so there are a lot of commercial outfits out there that need you to believe that social security wont be there so you have more motivation to use their investment services
7527071 right now the 401 k s are being turned into 201 k s
7527072 they say the stock market always comes back but its unpredictable when it will come back
7527073 there has never been a hint of scandal and it has paid its benefits every month on time
7527074 if you say its about insuring people against low income in their old age people feel comfortable with that but if you say its about redistributing from high income workers to low income workers that has a negative connotation
7527075 were having this big argument over the segment of the retirement system thats basically working and ignoring the parts that are broken particularly the pension part
7527076 thats what we should be having a discussion about not social security
7527077 i dont see theres any reason to rush to do something
7527078 i agree with him totally that there is no crisis its a small problem
7527079 the question is wouldnt it be better to address the small problem sooner rather than later
7527080 today its still the case that only 6 percent of workers have earnings above the maximum but now theyre getting 15 percent of the total payroll
7527081 sure after you wrote my copy i filled my workshop but im sure it was coincidence
7527082 i am the best half pass rider in the world
7527083 its quickly becoming a very popular way to build next generation applications theres a lot of interest in capturing the hearts and minds of developers
7527084 unfortunately the power plant that luminant operates has not been reliable over the past year
7527085 the cost of power resulting from luminants inability to consistently operate has forced us to make this decision
7527086 we have been forced to seek damages and other relief from them through ongoing litigation
7527087 for the past two months luminant has offered alcoa additional price protections along with a stable predictable and economically viable power supply
7527088 alcoa has refused taking an inflexible stance seeking power at unrealistically advantageous terms and demanding a price far below the prevailing commercial market price
7527089 while we continue to offer solutions these layoffs are alcoas business decision and they alone are responsible not anyone else

7527100 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7527101 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7527102 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

7527125 probably my most poignant seder memory is not with the bergers but what happened right after i came back from meeting golda meir in 1973 i had predicted that something was going on in egypt and i remember people talking about what it meant to them if israel were actually defeated
7527126 imagine our circumstance in the world were there no israel how many battleships would there be how many troops would be stationed
7527127 if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does anybody think there wouldnt be a full blown war in iraq
7527128 is that many americans can taste what it must feel like for every israeli mother and father when they send their kid out to school with their lunch to put them on a bus on a bicycle or to walk and they pray to god that cell phone doesnt ring

7527140 shooter which i recently recorded is available to transfer anywhere in the house including to pc
7527141 running a hedge fund is harder than it looks on tv
7527142 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7527143 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7527144 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7527145 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7527146 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7527147 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7527148 we have brilliant mathematicians and programmers we are very strong on data analysis and have developed better technology which is cutting edge in russia we are constantly inventing new programs to stay ahead
7527149 in two years since google opened an office in russia we havent lost a single specialist to our competitors because yandex is one of the best companies to work for in russia
7527150 it is an opportunity to mix both the personal and the political the candidates wife will have an opportunity to define him not just in front of the 4 000 delegates but mostly to the 15 000 members of the media here in town as well as to a nation watching and who better to define the candidate than the individual who knows him best
7527151 youll remember some comments she made where she was criticized for saying it was the first time in her adult life she had been proud of this country they later clarified those comments to say it was the first time in the election scenario that she was proud of her community and proud of her country but its certainly something people will be watching
7527152 part of the reason that this convention is here in denver youll hear the word practical youll here the word pragmatic a lot is a problem solver the whole idea is to show real peoples problems and then to actually highlight senator obama as the individual who they believe can best serve them
7527153 senator kennedy was one of obamas earliest supporters and gave credibility to senator obamas campaign especially with a number of people in the democratic party the name kennedy obviously still carries a lot of weight most people will remember the dramatic vote that senator kennedy came back to congress to make not too long ago after his illness struck to help continue medicare reimbursements to doctors this would be his second public appearance and certainly the entire pepsi center will receive him in a way that i think will certainly be the moment of the evening
7527154 he kennedy said that when he looked at senator obama he saw somebody with unparalleled leadership and he obviously feels it is important enough to show up and support him in person
7527155 tell the truth tell it all and tell it fast
7527156 i have sinned i apologize i let my wife down i let my family and friends down i let my supporters down and i let my party down i did have an affair with a woman and i fathered a child with her i am sorry for all the damage this has caused everyone and i am now retiring from my public life as a consequence of my decision
7527157 we offer what youre supposed to eat proper portions great flavor and we use fresh local ingredients as much as possible
7527158 we put the nutritional information in the back of the menu people who want to look at it do and those who dont dont
7527159 the idea that eating healthy doesnt mean feeling deprived is something restaurants see as a vehicle for change as a way to differentiate their offerings from their competitors
7527160 its hard to refute that health is related to diet
7527161 and restaurants are making up more and more of the daily diet the average american eats one out of three meals away from home
7527162 the goal is to leave consumers feeling invigorated not lethargic because theyve overindulged
7527163 if you can give the mouth something else to focus on it says wow
7527164 while restaurants are becoming more health conscious its only going to keep happening if people ask for it
7527165 if you decide ahead of time what you want to order it will eliminate temptation while you are at the restaurant
7527166 you can negotiate such situations by having part of your meal boxed to take home downsizing your order by selecting an appetizer and side salad instead of an entree or splitting the entree with someone
7527167 if you have a high quality meat fish or vegetable that has a great deal of flavor you dont need to eat a lot of it to feel satisfied
7527168 the idea that you can have an indulgent entree but improve your sides is something i enjoy because its a small change
7527169 if you make small steps to improve what you eat youll be healthier for it
7527170 finer dining establishments are flipping the traditional plating concept vegetables and carbohydrates are the main component and protein is secondary
7527171 go to restaurants where the people serving the food know what the ingredients are
7527172 well my main source of income is my web development business i do technical design and build web apps for businesses small and large for some reason family and friends always seemed to think this implied that i would be more than willing to build a nice website for them maybe in return for a cake or a hug other freelancers might nod in recognition at this point enticing as these offers where fact of the matter was that i never really had the time to build these websites for them much less keep them up to date this never ending deluge of requests together with the fact that a lot of my family and friends tend to dabble in the arts lead to the idea that i would be well served with a generalized tool that would allow me to quickly setup an online portfolio and that would allow the artist in question to maintain it themselves so what started as a website and cms for my mother quickly turned into a full fledged consumer product
7527173 i guess the fact that i opted to build this web application in the hours i wasnt spending on my freelance business was the biggest challenge startup veterans tend to tell you that the only way to get a project like this off the ground is to dedicate yourself fully to it and while they are probably right in most cases i found that my lack of both time and budget actually forced me to make some creative decisions when it came to managing these issues since i have a background in technical design i was able to write a reasonably solid technical design and outsource all the development work although this was the first time i opted for such a solution im quite happy with the results it allowed me to keep a certain distance from the development side of the project and regard the results more as client than builder in the end this allowed me to save costs and focus on the features not the technology having anxious family and friends available all waiting for their new portfolio helped as well of course i would only recommend outsourcing to startups who have technical expertise in house as well though
7527174 im based in the hague in the netherlands and as far as startups are concerned this isnt exactly a hotbed of entrepreneurship there are some startups here doing great stuff but there is definitely a lack of places where people in this scene can meet up and exchange ideas recently things are starting to look up though with more coworking spaces drinks and other events for entrepreneurs luckily i have a lot of business and friends in amsterdam so im regularly there to work on projects and tend to hang out at most of the places where you would find dutch startups spend a week in amsterdam coworking at the right places and you will probably meet 80 of the internet startups in the netherlands this relative small size of the scene as opposed to silicon valley can be a great advantage plus the atmosphere here is rather relaxed it also seems the the funding opportunities have been picking up lately with some dutch startups hooking up with great investors both local and abroad i have managed to stay self funded for now though so im hardly and expert in that particular part of startup culture
7527175 my startup is somewhat different from most since it totally ignores the social web when you sign up for a portfolio at fresh li there is no way to add your friends show off your great taste or even upload an avatar i have a very narrow focus of allowing people to manage their portfolio in a simple way and frankly the whole social thing just gets in the way for this particular use case the artists who host their website with fresh li dont want their visitors to see related work they want them to see their work without distractions this has great advantages in the sort of functionality i can get away with less is definitely better since it keeps things simple and most of my current clients do not have much experience on the next web expect perhaps updating their myspace pages therefore i dont think fresh li will have much of an impact on the next web but it does serve as a reminder that there is this huge untapped potential of people out there that still feel quite uncomfortable with most of what the next web has to offer hopefully i can convince some of these people that publishing on the web is not necessarily hard and can be achieved without learning lots of acronyms and share high quality posts even if youre not a tech nerd rss will play a vital role in the next web so we think its really important to help mainstream users get comfortable with it
7527176 my biggest challenge beyond the development one will be reaching the kind of people that would want to use fresh li since most of them are not really on the web in the sort of way that most of the readers of this blog will be i wont be able to reach them through the usual channels startups use like the next web techcrunch and others like them for my marketing efforts i will try and get as close to the source of artists as possible i e the art academy flyers should help but im also trying to get my website into the collection of tools students use to get their work online currently dominated by blogging tools not really fit for this purpose since my marketing budget is rather close to zero i wont be able to actually buy advertising space in some of the media that might be interesting to my target audience but i dont have much trust in the effectiveness of that kind of old media channel anyway what ive found so far is that word of mouth is by far the most effective some of my current customers have been the best pr people i could wish for most new customers find me because a friend pointed the site out to them still marketing in the non web world with a small budget is hard work and an area i would love to read more about

7527178 the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations
7527179 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7527180 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm
7527181 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns
7527182 i hope the next pageant wont just take place online but that we can organise a real show that can take place during the miss italy contest
7527183 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7527184 we have found a fossil that is 5 million years old
7527185 because we found it in this layer of earth that is 5 million years old
7527186 oh well then how do you know that layer of earth is 5 million years old
7527187 well obviously because we found a 5 million year old fossil in it
7527188 we are just as mixed up in views and needs aspirations as any other group of people its never been monolithic
7527189 theres always been a difference of opinion a difference of approach and thats healthy
7527190 because weve already had a referendum on this issue i think the people will have to be consulted
7527191 the government is involved in detailed research to isolate the specific matters that were most sensitive in the minds of voters as we went to the polls on 12 june those matters then have to be addressed
7527192 towards the end of the year well have to decide what our timetable is
7527193 we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people again
7527194 demand for credit analysts rises on the buy side in wake of rating agency disasters
7527195 the credit crisis has impacted the market as a whole
7527196 the impact can be felt in a number of areas
7527197 a year ago you never looked at the balance sheet of your clearinghouse
7527198 the buy side has definitely looked to strengthen counterparty credit risk
7527199 no counterparty is infallible particularly with the household names that have been affected
7527200 we will continue to trade with counterparties that we think are long term viable
7527201 as professionals in hr we know better than most how many of our colleagues lives are touched by extra burdens they carry outside of work autism is an especially painful burden where people do not know where to turn for help i have found a valuable source of help which needs to be better known www kylestreehouse org has the goal of empowering everyone touched by autism to make effective choices it offers rich social networking tools and clear unbiased referrals to all types of treatment are offered in a caringly crafted site could you please help to see that this valuable resource for autism is widely known in your company perhaps you can include a link to your portal or send the following message out to your lists or append it as an extra signature on your email for a week it could make a difference to people who you dont realize need help urgently thank you so much
7527202 the mask he wore is said to be similar to masks worn by heavy metal band slipknot who have been accused of producing satanic music
7527203 his words to us were when i put the mask over my face everything went dead quiet and only my body moved i wanted to stop but i couldnt
7527204 his friends said he was a quiet boy who kept to himself
7527205 we also call on parents to monitor their children very closely and get help urgently from clinical experts if their children demonstrate signs and antics of hate including withdrawal from society or family which in the long term results in such incidents of violence
7527206 yeah what a waste i mean eh whats wrong ichi
7527207 are you really going to sacrifice the comfort of your family just to evade this why are you acting like this anyway
7527208 are you stupid do you really not get it how am i supposed to sleep sound knowing my family is protected by someone other than myself someone who probably has never even been to karakura how
7527209 come on that cant be the real reason i know you better than you think ichigo
7527210 whatever like it really matters to you arent you going to try to take me back to the soul society
7527211 if i fight you ill get hurt and be unable to run besides more and more shinigamill come and then what will i do
7527212 if i throw you out will you leave me alone
7527213 im making dinner through so if you dont like i get the hell out
7527214 when you live with a man who thinks macaroni and cheese is a meal you learn to cook
7527215 geez ichigo you had me worried youve been missing for almost four hours you had a meeting today remember
7527216 wait a second why did you come find me shouldnt my lieutenant have come looking for me
7527217 well what the hell else was i supposed to do you get lost every two seconds
7527218 ill back off ill leave you alone and well pretend none of this ever happened i get it sorry
7527219 link to search results for obama and mccain so you dont have to type in their names on your phone each time you want information
7527220 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7527221 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity
7527222 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7527223 hes got the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that may come up more importantly i think he can help shape a long term strategy to make america more secure
7527224 when i initially got the news that biden was the vp choice i had mixed emotions
7527225 i was a little discouraged to hear that clinton had been overlooked
7527226 this convention i hope will bring out hillary and appreciate her for all of the work shes done especially for putting health care at the forefront
7527227 im going to vote for hillary clinton on the floor as provided by barack obamas agreement with senator clinton and then im going to support the democratic ticket with enthusiasm
7527228 we conducted a democratic process the person with the most delegates at the end of the day is the winner and i hope people will recognize that
7527229 its good that users are learning they need more than just anti virus to be safe on the internet today
7527230 avg free also protects against many drive by downloads and other web 2 0 threats by giving real time safety ratings to all search results obtained through google msn and yahoo
7527231 while we provide avg free because we believe everyone has a right to basic internet security users should remember that the free product does not protect against the full range of todays web borne threats for complete protection users should consider avgs commercial products
7527232 avg prides itself on being innovative agile and responsive to changing customer demands and being named most dynamic company by enterprise investors is confirmation of our ability to do exactly that
7527233 this is the first time that walling and avg have appeared on the gsa schedule so this contract is an important milestone for both our companies
7527234 it opens up an entirely new sales channel and is a huge vote of confidence by the u s government that taxpayer dollars for government information security solutions will be well spent with walling data
7527235 walling has a proven track record in introducing avg to new markets and providing superior customer services so they are well positioned to help avg enter this exciting new area
7527236 we anticipate a number of government organizations will join the existing avg user base of 70 million around the world avg is preferred by many organizations thanks to its robust unobtrusive protection low system resource use and competitive pricing add wallings comprehensive support services and you have a very compelling offering
7527237 we are extremely pleased to have achieved gold certified status in the microsoft partner program
7527238 it clearly shows our customers and business partners the high degree of expertise our people have in the use and support of microsoft tools and platforms everyone gains from this recognition
7527239 now were taking this to the court and to the people who need to know how the state is hurting their childs future and robbing them of a right to a quality education
7527240 oh and cousin donna needs purple and aunt pam will be there aunt judy and can you my make mine turquoiise to match my blouse
7527241 it is never too late to be what you might have been
7527242 the channel has become an increasingly important part of our business avg has made major investments to meet the unique needs of our partners and support them in successfully delivering on their customers security needs
7527243 we are extremely pleased with this latest recognition a proof point that our commitment to the channel is producing concrete results we will continue to work closely with our worldwide partners to best meet business and technological objectives
7527244 its clear from both the enisa report and our own research data that we all still have a considerable amount of work to do to protect computer users against cybercrime
7527245 in the space of a few years the nature of the threat has changed from a sport to professional criminal activity the challenge for us now is to deliver security with a light touch that does not stifle innovation
7527246 with the world flattening and borders disappearing online it becomes critical for businesses and home users to know that they can safely conduct transactions online we support enisas call to action and urge the industry to collaborate to make the internet a safe place to do business globally just as environmental policies are only truly effective when people and organisations get together securing the web by its very nature should be a collaborative undertaking thats why avgs threat research incorporates user input as a core component fostering an environment in which users cooperate with researchers to ensure the protection of all
7527247 the new avg active surf shield and search shield acquired through the purchase of exploit prevention labs last year proved particularly interesting for show visitors
7527248 getting a definitive safety report about every website they plan to visit is very appealing to people
7527249 the fresh taste of avg cocktails was as good as the quality of avg brand
7527250 this year cebit was exceptionally successful for avg and the excitement of bartenders show matched the excitement surrounding the launch of avg 8 0
7527251 with the release of avg free 8 0 we are underscoring our belief that all computer users regardless of their computer usage needs have the right to a safe and worry free computing experience
7527252 however it is important for users to remember that avg free does not protect against the full range of todays web borne threats for complete protection users should consider avgs commercial products which scan for and block threats before they can infect the computer or disrupt the user experience
7527253 the real time protection against drive by downloads is especially critical for business customers
7527254 because whenever a user surfs the internet they create a trusted yet insecure communications tunnel that generally bypasses the network firewall and therefore exposes the business to these new web borne threats
7527255 were delighted to finally have a way to work more closely with our customers and prospects in the nordic region
7527256 we look forward to significantly increasing our business in this important market particularly with the newly released avg 8 0 products for business and home users
7527257 we are looking forward to formally introducing avg 8 0 to the market here through our reseller network
7527258 the product is already very well known here thanks to the high quality of the products and great support from the people at avg

7527286 israel issues a comprehensive ban on students from gaza going abroad as part of its policy of collective punishment toward gaza residents thereby impinging on the right to education of hundreds of talented young people who want to study develop and create a better future in our region
7527287 indeed the very presence of this cluster confirms the existence of a mysterious component of the universe called dark energy
7527288 such massive galaxy clusters are thought to be rare objects in the distant universe they can be used to test cosmological theories
7527289 the existence of the cluster can only be explained with dark energy
7527290 according to the current cosmological theories we should only expect to find this one cluster in the 1 of sky that we have searched

7527327 meu querido bebezinho t o pequeno e fr gil hoje forte e muito amado por todos
7527328 marcelinha chegou ao mundo para tocar nossos cora es e para nos mostrar o verdadeiro sentido da vida
7527329 me deu uma semana para decidir se eu ia continuar com a gravidez eu respondi que n o certo ser t o cruel a ponto de matar essa crian a pequena e inocente
7527330 o potencial de dura o de vida desses rec m nascidos provavelmente mais longa do que a dura o de vida que eles t m agora porque eles n o recebem tratamentos vigorosos
7527331 diagn sticos incorretos de beb s como anencef licos t m sido documentados na literatura m dica e detectados por programas de exame

7527333 sinto me incrivelmente culpada s de pensar que eu poderia t lo matado
7527334 e ent o fico imaginando quantos outros beb s completamente normais s o mortos
7527335 a neuroplasticidade do tronco cerebral poderia ser suficiente para garantir ao beb anencef lico pelo menos nos casos menos s rios certa possibilidade simples de consci ncia

7527349 the best way to check in on the way youre standing the way youre sitting the way youre inhabiting your body is to check in on your breathing
7527350 to me thats the main check in point if you do that everything is going to fall in place
7527351 utterly vapid devoid of context frequently wrong and wedded to narratives that defy all logic and reality
7527352 liberals believe that they cant get a fair shake from the media anymore
7527353 thats an exact mirror of what the right did with talk radio
7527354 corrupted by their need to be part of the establishment
7527355 with the baby boom generation about to start joining the ranks of those age 65 and over the graying of the american workforce is only just beginning
7527356 like the original this trial is ultimately unsuccessful thus creating an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy
7527357 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
7527358 are you strong enough to be my man or my president
7527359 what im hearing from sen obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy
7527360 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7527361 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7527362 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7527363 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues
7527364 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7527365 its like honey what do you want to be a pariah what do you want to be crucified its a good thing in this country we dont have to tell anybody its no ones business who we vote for

7527377 historic as this moment is it does not signify a major victory in the ongoing battle
7527378 became the first viable black presidential candidate precisely by giving up his moral leverage over whites
7527379 it was a speech to think to not clap to
7527380 is not just choosing a yes man but a person that will speak what he believes
7527381 subverted by the lawyers for the extreme environmental organizations and the liberal democratic leadership
7527382 separated for the moment no plans for divorce at this time
7527383 my rating for this morning assuming that the wind continues to stay off shore amp the swell continues to be at waist height we have the best conditions we have had in about 2 weeks the on shore that the obx has experienced for the last 4 days has finally switched amp is now off shore i would check it out right now
7527384 mile high and an inch deep is what the republican party activists stationed here are calling obama
7527385 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7527386 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7527387 are you strong enough to be my man or my president
7527388 what im hearing from sen obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy
7527389 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7527390 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues
7527391 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7527392 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7527393 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7527394 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7527395 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7527396 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7527397 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7527398 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7527399 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7527400 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7527401 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7527402 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7527403 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7527404 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7527405 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7527406 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7527407 it was here in springfield where i saw all that is america converge
7527408 it was here where we learned to disagree without being disagreeable that it is possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised and that so long as we are willing to listen to each other we can assume the best in people instead of the worst
7527409 theres a reason that hes called the third senator from pennsylvania
7527410 the folks i was shaking hands with were all talking about sen biden
7527411 im confident that he will help every democrat on the ticket
7527412 wanted to be in a marquee tower on 125th street
7527413 you know im not going to buy any new stuff for a week ill buy food that i need if i need gas ill buy that but im not buying any new stuff no new clothes or books or dvds no furniture or tvs or cars or well anything new for one week
7527414 wow i dont need that stuff i thought i needed
7527415 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7527416 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7527417 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7527418 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7527419 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7527420 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7527421 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7527422 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7527423 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7527424 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7527425 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7527426 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7527427 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7527428 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7527429 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7527430 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7527431 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7527432 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7527433 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7527434 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7527435 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7527436 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7527437 when youre riding a motorcycle if youre passing by a bakery you can smell the fresh bread being baked on the other hand if youre behind a garbage truck youre going to smell that garbage truck
7527438 but youre out there in the environment up close with the wind blowing in your face on a hot summer day or the cold wind on a cold winter day
7527439 i ride a motorcycle because i enjoy the stress reduction it provides me when riding out on back roads it really enables you to see parts of the country you miss in a car being on a motorcycle requires you to be much more aware of your surroundings enabling you to notice many things on the road that we usually take for granted
7527440 my dad always spoke about that experience with a twinkle in his eye
7527441 a daredevil by nature he passed this trait onto me he was not pleased to learn of my new hobby when i first started riding i tried to remind him that i was merely following in his footsteps
7527442 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7527443 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7527444 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7527445 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7527446 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7527447 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7527448 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7527449 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7527450 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

7527452 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7527453 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7527454 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7527455 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7527456 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7527457 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7527458 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7527459 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7527460 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7527461 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7527462 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7527463 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7527464 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7527465 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7527466 this is a planning took where all things are going
7527467 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7527468 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7527469 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7527470 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7527471 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7527472 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7527473 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7527474 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7527475 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7527476 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7527477 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7527478 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7527479 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7527480 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7527481 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7527482 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7527483 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7527484 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7527485 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7527486 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7527487 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7527488 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7527489 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7527490 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7527491 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7527492 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7527493 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7527494 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7527495 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

7527499 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7527500 are you strong enough to be my man or my president
7527501 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7527502 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7527503 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7527504 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7527505 its like honey what do you want to be a pariah what do you want to be crucified its a good thing in this country we dont have to tell anybody its no ones business who we vote for
7527506 we feel its a natural feature just like when you buy a cd you should be able to do what you want with your tracks
7527507 haha i like that post i am a chair but a funky and comfortable one i am sure
7527508 i would have to save the book of revelation because if our society ever does ban literature and or the bible thats the time when we will need to
7527509 i think that everything you said was great blake scharzenbach is a poet and his words helped me through my crazy early teen years in fact i have never stopped
7527510 12 songs ended up on the final version with about 48 minutes of pure aggressive brutal melodic modern technical furious fast heavy and insane thrash metal we are very proud of this album and we know for sure that if you liked what weve done before you wont be disappointed in any way this time either darkane has developed in a way that hopefully will give us new fans as well not meaning that weve turned softer or more mainstream just better and more humble
7527511 jens enjoyed every second of the show and so did the rest of us our former vocalist andreas was in the audience to support us and he was very postive afterwards along with the rest of the crowd

7527519 he hasnt really changed a bit hes still the same guy and still screams with the same intensity as before
7527520 well he screams all the same patterns but may not actually say the objectionable stuff no one really knows the difference
7527521 some of the new material on the album will have some content on his faith but as far as im concerned he can sing about whatever he wants as long as he screams it

7527572 i respect the fact that we have a lot of ability people like benni mccarthy matt derbyshire roque santa cruz its always going to be tough to play and i respect that

7527597 decision of the russian state duma and council of federation creates dangerous negative precedent for the world
7527598 this decision should be failure and directed against russia thus there were nations within russia to declare their independencies in different times
7527599 i hope that the russian government will function within the framework of the international law and will maintain its authority as the leading country of the world
7527600 russia has always supported and protected this principle russia showed it during the chechen war however at present moscow does not respect this principle
7527601 russias decision does not stabilize situation in south caucasus region the decision will aggravate the complex situation in the region

7527609 lets put a vision in your mind about being on that gold medal stand and hearing our song
7527610 what were trying to do is develop a spirit where were not just saying something were showing them something
7527611 this is the first thing a lot of people saw when they came to this country
7527612 this is where a lot of dreams started for a lot of different people and families you have a dream in america where you can literally go from the bottom to the top this is our dream here now to bring a gold medal back to this country
7527613 when we go across these waters and we go play we got to be a no excuse team what i mean is its going to be us against the world and we got to look at it that way we cant blame the refs we cant blame the crowd we cant blame anything else on anybody we are in a position right now where we control our own destiny i know im guilty of this sometimes i sit at home and say if i had dwight howard on my team or if i had carlos boozer on my team or if i had chris paul as my point guard i would win an nba championship so whats my excuse now i got all yall on this team so whats my excuse now do we all have an excuse we dont this is everything that we always dreamed of of having that guy next to you and winning something im excited and i know you guys are this is what ive always wanted playing alongside carmelo anthony playing alongside jason playing with kobe i dont have no excuse now none of us

7527622 i diritti umani rendono loccidente inefficiente e non gli consentono di raggiungere gli elevati standard organizzativi e artistici di cui sono capaci i cinesi
7527623 gli esecutori obbediscono agli ordini e sono in grado di farlo come un computer questo lo spirito cinese
7527624 gli interpreti occidentali lavorano solo quattro giorni e mezzo alla settimana fanno due pause al giorno per il caff ma poi non sono nemmeno in grado di stare bene allineati
7527625 hanno anche a disposizione organizzazioni di ogni tipo e i sindacati
7527626 i cinesi riescono a realizzare in una settimana quello che gli europei fanno in un mese
7527627 eccolo dunque il combattente numero uno il guerriero pi abile di tutta la cina zhang yimou uno dei pi grandi esponenti della quinta generazione ovverosia di quel gruppo di autori cinesi che raccoltisi negli studi xian hanno scelto il cinema per esprimere ci che non compariva in una sola pellicola lesigenza di libert e la critica di un sistema politico totalitario e repressivo
7527628 la critica al totalitarismo e il desiderio di libert si colora di sfumature epiche e fantastiche nellopera di u uno dei pi rappresentativi registi di tutta la cina
7527629 secondo le accuse mosse da un gruppo di organizzazioni umanitarie britanniche riunite nella playfair alliance ad assemblare le mascotte e gli altri gadget olimpici in vendita da pi di un anno in tutte le strade le bancarelle i negozi della cina ci sarebbero in molti casi bambini anche di 12 anni alcune tra le aziende che hanno ottenuto la licenza di fabbricare questo genere di prodotti popolarissimi e grandemente remunerativi almeno fino al termine dei giochi sempre secondo le accuse non solo sfrutterebbero il minorile ma terrebbero anche centinaia di adulti in condizioni di semischiavit con turni massacranti di 15 ore nessun contratto e paghe equivalenti alla met del minimo salariale
7527630 naquela poca existia uma tremenda discuss o se o brasil fazia sentido ou se o b dos brics tinha morrido
7527631 a hp vinha investindo no brasil mas menos do que nos outros brics havia uma imagem de que o pa s n o estava crescendo que tinha viol ncia e instabilidade
7527632 eles acabaram surpresos ao saber por exemplo que o mercado brasileiro de software e servi os de tecnologia maior que o de equipamentos
7527633 isso coloca o brasil ao lado de pa ses como jap o fran a e alemanha
7527634 pouqu ssimos pa ses receberam destaques em todos os relat rios da dell nos ltimos trimestres como foi o caso do brasil

7527643 off season fantasy basketball the first fantasy basketball game governed by the rules of the nbas collective bargaining agreement
7527644 users can either take over the gm duties of an nba team or create a sport agency based on the end of the 2007 08 regular season the object of the game is to re tool your team for the up and coming fantasy basketball season and to find new homes for nba free agents during the free agency period in addition to traditional trading which involves matching player salaries gms have to decide team options create a draft list for the rookie nba draft negotiate player buyouts and work with agents to sign free agent players during the free agency period agents decide player options like baron davis or gilbert arenas for example and look out for the best situation for their clients the game is pretty involved as it captures all the elements and drama of an nba off season from both the gm and sports agent prospective which is why it starts in the summer time now unlike traditional fantasy basketball games the game is unique because it crosses into the business of sports as it tests a users business savvy both from an nba gms prospective as well as from an agents prospective we created the game because many nba adult fans think they have what it takes to be an nba gm but in reality the task is very demanding
7527645 what would i do if i were an nba gm
7527646 we are absolutely thrilled to have monta under contract for the next several years he has been one of the top young players in the nba for the last two years and enjoyed a tremendous season last year the growth that he has demonstrated at such a young age is incredible and we look forward to him playing a big part in our future success
7527647 we are pleased to have kelenna back in the fold
7527648 hes a young and talented player who has continued to improve during his two seasons with our team
7527649 what i do wish to know is how i can download the latest version of user directory do we need to purchase it again
7527650 we have developed an extremely simple iphone application that allows us to display comics that have been specifically formatted for the iphone ipod touch
7527651 what were doing is creating new comics and adapting existing comics into a format that makes reading comic books an enjoyable and easy experience on these devices
7527652 creators and studios will be able to set the final prices on their titles but were expecting most standard length titles to be around 99 and were encouraging creators to give away the first issues of their titles to allow new readers who may not be familiar with comics but are iphone ipod touch owners to give comics on the devices a try
7527653 with digital comics on the iphone ipod touch we have access to a world wide audience no printing costs or print run minimums and it doesnt take 3 months to get the title from in the catalog to on sale in a store each title will be featured as its own application in the app store and will be backed up onto the readers desktop or notebook computer each time they sync their device
7527654 that investigation with respect to all our officials has been completed but the report itself is not ready to be issued because it was always contemplated that it would be done after mr donaghy was sentenced and against the hope that the request made several months ago from mr donaghys lawyer that he meet with mr pedowitz would be responded to in a positive way
7527655 the u s attorneys office and the fbi have fully investigated it and mr donaghy is the only one thats guilty of a crime
7527656 the fiba game is played from outside in whereas in the united states in college and the nba the game is played from inside out
7527657 thats where dwyane wade has to have the discipline not to come over to help on yao ming and leave the three point shooter
7527658 you see players take max deals and they financially bind their teams i dont wanna be one of those players and three years down the road your team is strapped and cant do anything about it
7527659 it was very important for us to get a deal done he creates a sense of security around the basket for us hes a guy that i think his skills are still developing in a lot of ways having larry brown as our head coach now emeka will benefit having a great coach to teach him
7527660 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7527661 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal
7527662 so we monitor that but disarming an armed militia is not in 1701
7527663 the participation of some main european countries in unifil gave this robust atmosphere
7527664 it gives unifil today much more political clout than the united nations itself
7527665 they israel and hezbollah can all challenge the un but they are not going to challenge the french the germans the italians the spanish this is the strength of unifil
7527666 weve been a huge deterrent for the restarting of any kind of hostilities we havent witnessed any rearming of armed elements here in the south
7527667 i have to protect my soldiers and fulfil my mission
7527668 when you go behind your walls your barbed wire and just move in aggressive mechanised convoys you lose contact with the people
7527669 in the long run thats very dangerous because in south lebanon that contact is your best security
7527670 this reservoir will benefit 150 families who grow olives and tobacco
7527671 it means a lot for qabrikha the economy and sport
7527672 people dont understand why they cant stop the israeli violations by land sea and air
7527673 nato russian relations will need to take fully into account the implications of russian military actions in georgia
7527674 however we believe it would be a mistake to suspend all nato russia contacts when they are so much needed
7527675 we are ready to accept any decision up to halting relations altogether
7527676 we regret that this vote will only add tension in the region
7527677 we call on russia to live up to its commitments and refrain from acts which may further raise already very high levels of tension
7527678 this move can only raise suspicions about russias motives and aims coming after news of continued russian military activity in senaki and poti
7527679 it is with great concern that we witness the deteriorating humanitarian situation in various parts of mindanao as a result of the recent upsurge in conflict
7527680 many civilians have lost their lives and many more are at risk
7527681 the agencies of the iasc who come together to coordinate relief efforts on behalf of the international community in times of crisis appeal for calm and protection of all civilians
7527682 they civilians are safe to go home now but we understand the trauma they are now suffering
7527683 our troops and police are trying their level best more than what is expected of them to end this as soon as possible but it would be dishonest of me to say it will be over soon
7527684 unicef reports 7 500 children in madhu education zone and 4 500 children from vavuniya north zone have been displaced
7527685 educational materials have been lost due to multiple displacements and the quantity of materials is insufficient for the upcoming term
7527686 in 2008 35 temporary learning spaces have been constructed for displaced schools in vavuniya and mannar districts
7527687 support provided also includes provision of student kits teacher kits blackboards recreational kits and tarpaulins
7527688 many students who faced a lack of shelter were not in a sound position to prepare for their exams others were unable to attend
7527689 however the ministry of education mobilised resources and ensured most children could sit exams in alternative centres
7527690 the students ended up taking the exams at kilinochchi central college
7527691 when the new term starts in september we will have more issues to deal with
7527692 the power couple is also responsible for inspiring so many other couples including celebrity couples to marry more than once we are so happy to see so many people now choosing to marry multiple times or renew their vows privately and publicly our hearts warm when someone says thank you for inspiring us
7527693 i am devastated to now find out the game was not officiated fairly

7527695 we knew about the chimney from references but it couldnt be found in the home duchamp owned for the final seven years of his life

7527707 saya sebagai ketua umum berterima kasih kepada kpk yang dalam mengusut tetap mempertimbangkan asas praduga tak bersalah biasanya kalau saya ikuti dalam masalah ini harus berhati hati azas praduga tak bersalah dalam hukum formal biasanya menjadi sangat diabaikan
7527708 akan dirapatkan dulu sebagai kader partai apapun permasalahan yang akan disampaikan kepada masyarakat harus melalui penugasan partai yang bersangkutan memberikan suatu masukan sebagai perorangan karena tentunya tidak bisa melalui azas praduga tak bersalah itu sepertinya enak saja mengatakan ini dan itu kita juga musti mengetahui seberapa jauh latar belakang dari hal yang telah dilakukan

7527712 rispetto al passato le regine del calcio italiano degli ultimi tre anni si somigliano di pi per latteggiamento tattico difensivo con gli esterni a ripiegare fino alla linea di fondo se necessario e per quel pivot davanti alla difesa

7527716 he was an active man his entire life and he was doing something the moment he died
7527717 he was a very fortunate man he lived his life exactly the way he wanted
7527718 i cant think of anything i like better than farming
7527719 he was one of the most well respected horticulturists in the state and throughout the region
7527720 he maintained the long tradition of caring for the land and producing good healthy food
7527721 it cant be much maam thats the throw away part
7527722 nme and nas approvals are key measures of new drug productivity in the biopharmaceutical industry and these measures tend to improve based on the volume of new drug submissions the recent increase in the number of nme submissions is an encouraging sign nmes are a closely watched category because they are medicines that have never before been approved for any use
7527723 our analysis also shows that record percentages of drug marketing applications that the fda has designated as priority submissions are going straight to approval in the first review cycle
7527724 oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory that your hand be with me that you would keep me from evil that i may not cause pain

7527845 are you strong enough to be my man or my president
7527846 what im hearing from sen obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy
7527847 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7527848 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7527849 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7527850 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues
7527851 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7527852 its like honey what do you want to be a pariah what do you want to be crucified its a good thing in this country we dont have to tell anybody its no ones business who we vote for
7527853 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket
7527854 the story here is more the obama not clinton ticket
7527855 if i were a hillary clinton supporter this morning id be scratching my head
7527856 right now i dont think theres any question that the clintons are wholeheartedly behind barack obama
7527857 were not going to shy away from making the contrast
7527858 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7527859 people keep pushing into one another it does get very crowded those women behind you they come with their blanket i find that so obnoxious the whole blanket thing they bring so much stuff their tables two chairs they take up more space than me with my four kids
7527860 we usually try to spread out as much as we can
7527861 we run our gear down first and get the kids later
7527862 there could be no one else on the beach and theyll sit next to me
7527863 it reflects a change in the wider society and the public attention on issues of global warming and the rising cost of energy

7527869 i love it where i live and i dont want to see it developed
7527870 i was reading that about 40 percent of pollution coming from the car happens in the first two minutes or first two miles

7527873 people today get it that we all have to do our part to make a difference
7527874 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket
7527875 the story here is more the obama not clinton ticket
7527876 if i were a hillary clinton supporter this morning id be scratching my head
7527877 right now i dont think theres any question that the clintons are wholeheartedly behind barack obama

7527886 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7527887 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7527888 you have a question of unlimited need and limited resources
7527889 they have a lot more to spend now and they like spending it on sports
7527890 and more and more countries are winning them there are only so many to win if the chinese are winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did

7527898 this state has always been competitive we vote the way the country does almost all the time
7527899 both cultural and economic interests that are moderate to conservative
7527900 the republicans have been successful at mobilizing a certain amount of resentment over environmental programs and capitalizing on an anti washington bias thats important in some parts of the region
7527901 we dont look anything like the regular usa but somehow were the bellwether
7527902 weve got at least three states in one so were a real cross section

7528299 engaged face to face with the infant and speak in a fully adult sophisticated chatty language as if the infant were listening comprehending and fully responding to the comments it is deliberate uncompromised personal adult conversation it is talking about what ifs do you remember shouldnt you wouldnt it be better if and so on these often take the form of questions that invite infants to think deeply about what is happening around them language dancing entails chattiness thinking aloud and commenting on what the child is doing and on what the parent is doing and planning other scholars have shown that the most powerful factor influencing reading skills is auditory processing skill the very skill that is honed as infants listen to parents speak to them in sophisticated adult language
7528300 80 percent of the variation in public school performance results from family effects such as those summarized above not school effects
7528301 the level of income ethnicity and level of parents education had no explanatory power in determining the level of cognitive capacity that the children achieved it is all explained by the amount of language dancing that the parents engaged in
7528302 there were other things off the field that people didnt really know about
7528303 at this precise moment in time i feel i made the right decision i didnt want to do what paul sturrock is trying to do which is rebuild a team
7528304 we started last season with a good team but by the end of the season 13 players would be out of contract
7528305 we kept talking about who we were going to keep and how much we were going to give them they had them on such small contracts which is great management but the players had started to win in the championship and other teams had seen that so they were going to be sought after
7528306 they were going to walk out on bosman rulings wed had it happen the year before when tony capaldi went to cardiff and he told some of his mates how much he was getting
7528307 we inherited a problem at plymouth and i realised the more we were talking about it the more we couldnt solve it and i didnt want to do that any more
7528308 even now i still cant believe how we didnt get one goal in any one of 10 games
7528309 bristol city at home or even stoke on the last day of the season we just needed one goal the chances we missed were unbelievable
7528310 i believe theyre in a better place now and i believe nigels going to take them forward
7528311 the players that they have got there are going to be strong in that division and theyre building every club needs to bottom out and i think they bottomed out last summer
7528312 it was devastating for me because lifes all about timing and that was wrong as it was proved
7528313 but i wish them all the very best their supporters are absolutely outstanding
7528314 at the end of the day if iain dowes given the chance to spend money hes got a proven record of taking a team to the premier league i hope it works for him
7528315 youre talking about new directors and new owners and with the greatest respect to them they have to learn that this is a different business and you have to trust people who know what theyre doing
7528316 it must be difficult for them because theyve got all the money in the world but its about building a spirit within the squad that is strong sometimes that doesnt happen no matter how much money youve got
7528317 i believe iain will do it and im very proud that i was left holding that baby at a time when no one else wanted to
7528318 its a great club and i hope their fans are given what they want which is top flight football again
7528319 its the politics that kills you in management it really does
7528320 you can never really make a decision youve always got to get it through other people youve got your players and youve got your squad but youre never totally and utterly in control
7528321 its everywhere any manager can try to make decisions you can buy a player but if he gets injured then before you know it youve lost your main striker youre not really in control
7528322 what you do is you learn to firefight and you get on with it the clubs ive been at ive always had to do that because ive had limited budgets

7528336 felipe was really quick he drove a really good race but we were there with two cars

7528339 january was just a case of me feeling like i deserved the opportunity to play and not getting it
7528340 you always feel a little bit hard done by in those circumstances but i respect the players
7528341 i respect the fact that we have a lot of ability people like benni mccarthy matt derbyshire roque santa cruz its always going to be tough to play and i respect that
7528342 but obviously you feel like youve earned that right and you feel disappointed
7528343 im always happy when im playing im happy now because im playing and the next time that changes i wont be happy
7528344 im glad im here and hopefully ill be here for years to come scoring goals

7528355 im zuge der globalisierung er ffnen sich viele gewinnchancen f r vertragsmanagement experten
7528356 doch gleicherma en m ssen sie auch neue herausforderungen meistern wie u a h here vertragsvolumina wahrung der rechte am geistigen eigentum auch im ausland unterschiedliche und sich stets ndernde regulatorische anforderungen oder auch die notwendigkeit die risiken zu minimieren die sich aus unterschiedlichen gerichtsbarkeiten ergeben die bedeutung eines effektiven vertragsmanagements darf somit auf keinen fall untersch tzt werden
7528357 nur wenige der befragten unternehmen geben an ber ein zentralisiertes oder zentral geleitetes vertragsmanagement zu verf gen
7528358 hinzu kommt dass viele keine standardprozesse im vertragsmanagement implementiert haben sie arbeiten mit hauseigenen systemen aus tabellen und datenbanken die weder die n tige skalierbarkeit aufweisen noch die entsprechenden zugriffsm glichkeiten erlauben und keinerlei transparenz bieten dies sind aber faktoren die f r eine abteilungs und funktions bergreifende zusammenarbeit unerl sslich sind
7528359 interessanterweise stimmen die herausforderungen mit den funktionalit ten berein die sich die befragten von einer contract management l sung erhoffen das zeigt das gro e potenzial f r unternehmen prozesse durch die automatisierung ihres vertragsmanagements effizienter zu gestalten
7528360 eine umfassende l sung zum vertragsmanagement kann einen systematischen prozess f r die erstellung durchf hrung archivierung compliance und analyse von vertr gen in einem unternehmen erm glichen dies hilft bei der optimierung der betrieblichen performance der kostenreduzierung und der minimierung von risiken

7528372 of the two leading real estate firms in our town adams realty and fitch realty adams is clearly superior adams has 40 real estate agents in contrast fitch has 25 many of whom work only part time moreover adams revenue last year was twice as high as that of fitch and included home sales that averaged 168 000 compared to fitchs 144 000 homes listed with adams sell faster as well ten years ago i listed my home with fitch and it took more than four months to sell last year when i sold another home i listed it with adams and it took only one month thus if you want to sell your home quickly and at a good price you should use adams
7528373 i have bigger issues that fit together that youre not aware of on this one point youre right but from my perspective and the other related issues youre wrong
7528374 its good to go against other teams its good to see different faces across the line
7528375 thats so important its also really important that we get out of here without injuries
7528376 i took this as a good opportunity for our young guys to run routes and to throw the ball deep
7528377 other than a few dropped passes the protection was somewhat solid i am excited about it all
7528378 its a good situation with a coaching staff that has been together for a long time it feels good to coach with a staff you have a good relationship with
7528379 i never ever met the coach until after we moved we had never even said hello
7528380 we just moved because we wanted a smaller community and a smaller school it had nothing to do with athletics the academics here are no 1 and we like that
7528381 it was hard to leave we have a lot of ties with some good kids and some of the coaches in kentwood but we did what was best for our kids we wanted them in a smaller school did you know that the size of a j s class at kentwood is the same size as the entire enrollment at east he is just not a number here
7528382 a j s an outstanding athlete he has really quick feet a great attitude and he hits
7528383 and no there was no recruiting i never talked to them before the family chose to live in east grand rapids and they moved we did this straightforward when someone moves here we do all the checks we have to we dotted every i and crossed every t
7528384 the only thing i care about now is if a j is happy he is he doesnt care where he plays either he just wants to play
7528385 i love it here it has been a good transition
7528386 we wanted a new start a new beginning and its been great i love the coaches i love the attitude of the players everyone works hard there is a lot of tradition a lot of pride and its fun to be a part of that

7528454 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7528455 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7528456 thats how you could quickly get into this darker scenario
7528457 if theres a consensus its probably that prices will fall another 10 percent between now and next summer which would be 25 percent down from peak to trough

7528469 sir uh i okay we can scan that outside as well
7528470 why do you need to check it i thought you were just scanning it
7528471 uh thats not a reason this has personal information on it and i dont see how its for security

7528491 i wake up at two three am and automatically reach over to where she used to
7528492 where she used to lay and i feel that empty space and realize that shes really gone you know shes really gone and ill never see her again
7528493 the whole time she was sick i kept telling myself that this day was going to come and i needed to you know prepare myself emotionally but i didnt mainly because i really didnt know how i mean how do you prepare yourself for the death of the only person you ever loved
7528494 thanks for asking but its something i really have to learn how to accept i mean its been close to a year
7528495 oh i dont know hes a nice enough guy and all but i somehow get the feeling that the questions he asks and the things he tells me are all right out of a book i could probably buy at barnes and noble for twenty bucks
7528496 i started to say no but lately ive been doing a lot of thinking about things like that
7528497 not really you see i spent most of my life as an agnostic at least i think thats what you call people who dont really know for sure what they believe so to now hold open the possibility that god is real and could possibly be a source of consolation feels a little bit like cheating
7528498 if my wife hadnt died i wouldnt be paying any attention at all to god but shes dead and i hurt and im grasping for anything that will make me feel better that will somehow pull me out of this this emotional bog ive fallen into
7528499 are you saying that its cheating for a drowning man to reach out for help when hes going under

7528509 big money investors have turned oil into a proxy for the u s dollar
7528510 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7528511 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7528512 as much star power but not as much veteran leadership

7528562 when you look at the evidence theres no question artificial trans fat increases the risk for coronary heart disease
7528563 the most conservative estimates show that the replacement of these fats with heart healthy alternatives can decrease coronary artery disease risk by 6 percent and it is likely even higher
7528564 if youre mindful that you want to decrease both trans fat and saturated fat youre in a good position i think some people are so focused on trans fat that they forget about saturated fat
7528565 its just a matter of time before these fats virtually disappear from the american landscape

7528583 i swear by apollo asclepius hygieia and panacea and i take to witness all the gods all the goddesses to keep according to my ability and my judgment the following oath
7528584 i think they are good people but they were unfortunate to have had bad advice
7528585 from my point of view the possible outcome facing the family if they were to fight all the charges in the thai courts is dim evidence against them is very strong personally i dont think it was right that they violated the bail conditions but for them its the right move they have witnessed their lawyers being sent to jail and also the three year prison sentence for khunying potjaman was enough to convince the family that perhaps it was time to go
7528586 its utter nonsense what he claimed that he would not get a fair trial in the thai justice system and there was not any hard evidence against him and his family seeking political asylum here is an easy escape but i do hope that the english courts would see through him and refuse his application because he is not facing a death sentence at home nor is his life in danger the family is very lucky because they are so rich they can afford to do anything but they should not be above the law what i believe is that what goes around comes around perhaps they cannot buy their way out of what has come around this time
7528587 as for whether or not he would seek political asylum here i think at the end of the day he will get away with everything look at rakesh saksena fugitive thai bank adviser for example he was never brought back to face trial in thailand having said that i dont really think thaksin will apply for asylum here
7528588 he thaksin argued that he chose the uk because democracy means more here but people can see it that the court proceedings in thailand are carried out under the strict rules of constitution however i wouldnt be surprised if he and his wife are allowed to live here after all many former world leaders who abused their own people and violated human rights in their countries like augusto pinochet late dictator of chile were welcomed to the uk still i believe its not a bad thing that he left thailand at least it helps reduce political temperature and conflicts there

7528595 borrowers use all available credit card and overdraft facilities and draw on their mortgage facilities or obtain a second bond they use up savings withdraw money market investments and sell shares they borrow from family and microlenders and explore consolidation options if they have fixed property for security

7528741 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7528749 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7528758 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7528773 therell be even less money and political support to protect watersheds and to invest in the infrastructure repairs that we desperately need
7528774 i was surprised by how complicated both bottled water and tap water are
7528775 while i was researching my last book garbage land on the secret trail of trash i developed an obsession with single use packaging i just saw so many empty water bottles lying around in new york city and everywhere i went crushed in the gutters and overflowing litter baskets and in the woods i started wondering how it got to this point where we are drinking 50 billion bottles of water a year and spending 11 billion on it
7528776 i think its great that people are drinking more water and if bottled water sales have gone up soft drink sales have gone down and its great that were not drinking these high calorie drinks with high fructose corn syrup
7528777 i just think people need to know what the environmental and social toll of the water is and if their tap water is good realize that what theyre doing is redundant and harmful its certainly more expensive so i hope that people will do the right thing buy a refillable bottle and filter their tap water if they have to
7528778 i was looking at all these bottled water ads and their message is that we have to hydrate hydrate hydrate they attribute every physical malady to under hydration she was having trouble with spelling and i thought maybe shes dehydrated if i was tired too early in the day id think well maybe im dehydrated if i have a headache maybe im dehydrated its like medical students when they read the merck manual and think they have all these problems
7528779 i dont think that water should be free i actually think that public water is too cheap in the u s at least we have the lowest water rates in the developed world i dont think that utilities are making enough money to do what they have to do to protect watersheds and improve infrastructure and use advanced treatment technologies rainwater falls for free and snow melts but it takes a lot of money to deliver the water and take care of it
7528780 but public control is essential bottled water companies dont answer to their customers they answer to shareholders
7528781 we have the same amount of water on the planet that weve had for the last four and a half billion years
7528782 climate change is affecting the availability of water dry places are getting dryer and wet places are getting wetter and it also affects the quality of water when you have big storm events they wash more pollutants into waterways as we saw in the midwest with all this agricultural runoff and so you get much more polluted water than under a normal rainfall regime in wetter places the pipes gets wrecked because we have an aging infrastructure in this country there are water main breaks all the time i think the statistic in the book is between 250 000 and 300 000 water main breaks a year a lot of them happen during these intense storms the storms overwhelm the systems and then you get more raw sewage put back into waterways so its just bad news all around
7528783 i might have quoted someone in the book saying that recycled water was the option of last resort
7528784 the people who run the waste water treatment plant and many other people in the environmental community agree that we can no longer look at waste water as something to get rid of we have to think of it as a resource and clean it up
7528785 i tasted that water and it tasted great thats not the issue the issue is what you
7528786 but most people i interviewed for that story believed that the system was fine actually the water that they make there is cleaner than the water that youre going to get in any city in the world there are no drugs in that water and we know that there are drugs in most big city water systems
7528787 i think that pressure groups have been really successful at educating people
7528788 and i know that nestl coke and pepsi their water sales have dropped in the last quarter
7528789 the economy is making me hopeful because people are learning more about the safety of their tap water and theyre learning more about the environmental consequences of bottled water and theyre saying wait a minute this is a luxury that i can no longer afford

7528794 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7528795 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7528796 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7528797 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7528798 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

7528800 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7528801 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7528802 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7528803 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7528804 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7528805 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7528806 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7528807 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7528808 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7528809 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7528810 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7528811 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7528812 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7528813 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7528814 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7528815 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7528816 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7528817 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7528818 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7528883 ci sembra giusta la presenza di almeno un giovane come membro allinterno di ogni comitato cos i nostri interessi potranno venire pienamente rappresentati mentre le decisioni potranno diventare pi plurali grazie al confronto di generazioni la recente ristrutturazione dei comitati e del c g i e infine costituisce unottima opportunit per limplemento di tale proposta

7528887 they speak their minds so you see bullying in the form of teasing taunting social isolation and name calling
7528888 kids who are bullied are at greater risk of physical symptoms physical complaints emotional problems and academic underachievement
7528889 when you see signs of being anxious sad and withdrawn of having a kid move off their typical personality it alerts you that something is going on
7528890 when you see a real change in a childs personality or their normal routine its a bad sign
7528891 one of the reasons kids dont tell their parents they are being bullied is the fear that their parents will run in and do something about it and they think that will make it worse
7528892 you often know them your kids have been in school together you feel like calling them up so theyre on the defensive and really its never a point of resolution
7528893 you need to find out when it is happening where it is happening and exactly what is going on
7528894 younger kids have a limited arsenal from which to draw
7528895 they want to know about it because it ripples into the classrooms and places that arent visible to them
7528896 i do not want parents to leave us out of the scenario
7528897 you will encounter situations where parents will tell their kids if you are hit i want you to hit back
7528898 the best case scenario as local school principal we are bullyproof fully free of any bully incidents that we are truly here with academic focus no fighting no teasing no name calling none of that were here to learn

7528905 the person who continuously avoids taking responsibility plays the blame game whereas a responsible person will be more likely to point out why he couldnt deliver the results and take steps to fix things
7528906 you can blame others in your workplace for not getting the results you want
7528907 you can make excuses which is another form of blame
7528908 or you can refuse to take responsibility for your own reactions
7528909 for instance a co worker might say something that you find offensive and instead of communicating with that person about the situation you just avoid contact youre not taking responsibility for your response to that person
7528910 people who have an internal locus of control take personal responsibility people with an external locus of control attribute responsibility outside of themselves thats why a manager who has an external locus of control will accept any excuse you give him about why you arrived at work late the manager with the internal locus of control will tell you its your responsibility to get yourself to work on time regardless of the circumstances
7528911 you cant change that but you can change your behaviour
7528912 the employees would make excuses for not doing their jobs properly and the psychiatrists would look for psychological reasons why they werent being responsible
7528913 a company rolls out a product and it doesnt work for instance each department blames the others marketing blames the technical department which blames credit theres nothing rational about it its an irrational way of deflecting responsibility and it means no ones really performing

7528971 we really battled and gave our all but we just couldnt get the decisive goal
7528972 the breaking point for us was that we didnt make use of the countless openings that we had in spite of the strength of the schalke defence we still managed to get free on goal three or four times thats when we should have decided the match in our favour we were the better team and controlled schalke

7529242 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7529243 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7529244 the american lung association is going to add it as a risk factor
7529245 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7529246 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7529247 its a population based study which means that you can make an association but not necessarily a conclusion
7529248 it probably promotes more work in the area of routine household items and things we need to be looking at more prospectively to make a clear cause and effect relationship
7529249 anything that affects air quality negatively is not a good thing
7529250 burning in general and the release of smoke these things are certainly to be avoided at the very least chemical irritants will set off asthma and thats reversible cancer is not reversible

7529623 i havent completely mastered the art of unhitching the oxen
7529624 but mr sprouse makes sure our watches arent shirked and you know it
7529625 no call for a man with his own wagon and responsibilities to shoulder yours
7529626 i dont mind taking the extra watch in exchange for their cooking
7529627 youre lagging behind as it is not being able to control your animals is one more hassle to endanger the train one rampaging ox can set off a stampede
7529628 well be ready to pull out at dawn same as everyone else

7529632 i hear the mountains are littered with furniture and heirlooms abandoned by travelers so they can get free of a snow bank or make it up a steep pass
7529633 after that rough river crossing we already lost several items
7529634 so we probably wont need to leave anything else behind

7529678 our basic premise is that consumer purchases are altered by the portfolio of drink sizes made available
7529679 consumers who purchased a 16 ounce drink when a 12 ounce drink was available later chose a 21 ounce drink when the 12 ounce drink option was removed since now the 16 ounce soda is the smallest option
7529680 this effect also occurred at the large end of the spectrum people who purchased a 21 ounce drink when the 32 ounce drink was the largest size available moved up to the 32 ounce drink when a 44 ounce drink was added to the range of drink sizes available
7529681 the increasing availability of single serve and multi packs may not serve consumers in the long run but because they are considered to be innocent pleasures may turn out to be sneaky small sins
7529682 dat heeft te maken met contracten die hiervoor worden afgesloten

7529696 auto industry lobbyists want congress to set rules that will allow the initial 25 billion to pay the full cost of upgrading assembly plants parts production or engineering to improve fuel efficiency said the people who didnt want to be identified because the plans are still being developed the current rules limit loans to 30 percent of the cost
7529697 our plans which require significant investments are at risk because of limited access to capital
7529698 this program will open capital that is necessary to make sure our transformational plans continue at full speed and give us the best chance to succeed
7529699 this is a horrible idea another transfer of funds to failed ventures

7529702 we had a son who attended harvard for one year he loved harvard he was happy here but about a year ago he was accidentally killed my husband and i would like to erect a memorial to him somewhere on campus
7529703 we cant put up a statue for every person who attended harvard and died if we did this place would look
7529704 we dont want to erect a statue we thought we would like to give a building to harvard
7529705 a building do you have any earthly idea how much a building costs we have over seven and a half million dollars in the physical buildings here at harvard
7529706 is that all it costs to start a university why dont we just start our own

7529717 taggy please try to dress up properly u know ur meeting a gal
7529718 for the past years cosga hasnt rendered any proper account to us it is not transparent
7529719 the most painful aspect of it is that now that we have the opportunity to operate our own private societies and ensure that laws governing them are appropriate some key members in the music industry have joined forces with the copyright administration to make sure that the new regulations with all their major flaws are passed into law
7529720 these laws they are pushing on us are just too much and we will not accept them
7529721 also why should each private music collecting society have to establish functional offices in five regions of ghana before being allowed to operate this is financially crippling and simply not right it is our music our own intellectual property and we must get what is best for us they must not impose such unbearable burdens on us it is totally unfair
7529722 and to date nobody has had the courtesy to explain to stakeholders why this happened

7529799 die amerikaner haben jahrelang ber ihre verh ltnisse gelebt jetzt sind sie zur ck auf dem boden der realit t

7529808 there are things i might give up but its not going to be pilates
7529809 certainly found the niche of clients that wish to invest in their health via pilates
7529810 play to your strengths as a teacher as a studio owner
7529811 ive seen this mistake and ive made this mistake for years which is let me try to capture another audience let me try to go after another group of people instead of doing what you do best if you work best with one type of client and you have no trouble getting them go after more of them dont look for a whole other group of people and teachers do that too they have a natural tendency to attract a certain type of client whether or not thats the type of client they prefer to work with theres a sort of natural strength at play there if youre naturally good at that and its just coming to you go for it use it amplify that
7529812 the really good thing about economic downturns is that they make you analyze everything to streamline operations and expenses while maximizing revenues we have really trimmed a lot of the fat out of our budget and honestly we wouldnt have known it was an unnecessary expense until we were forced to take a hard look at it i think it is a great time to look at the efficiency of your operations it is also a good time to get very strategic about growth no one is going to loan us money for expansion in this economy so our growth has to come out of profits which makes one very aware of creating true profit as opposed to just having enough cash flow to get by
7529813 you can say hey instead of your privates this month lets do semi privates or a group reformer class or one of each so you can keep your twice a week workout but save half the money
7529814 that will keep your client in the studio instead of loosing them entirely by giving them the option you really want to keep them coming back
7529815 we are located about 10 blocks north of ground zero so 9 11 obviously had a substantial impact on us we were closed for i think a total of 10 days having said that the area we were in was without electricity some blocks for longer than us our clients relocated many permanently and others just sort of fled the immediate area for a period of time there were grants and some assistance that came about but for the most part we were hit very hard we did not recover immediately we had to be creative with our pricing structure with our staffing we took on less administrative personnel during that period and tried to do more ourselves we offered more incentives with respect to packages and series cards that were available to clients and it may seem a little counterintuitive but i actually put some money back into the physical space during that period because i felt like what i was offering in our space was this haven a place where people could go to get away from it there was a spirit of camaraderie there was something comforting in going back to your same old pilates studio where you knew the people and they knew you i felt like we shared the experience our clients did and that made us closer i made the space a little more welcoming a little warmer and i think it really helped it just gave that extra something special that people look forward to coming in for it seemed a little odd to be spending the money that way but i thought you know the people who are coming here really want to feel good about that its important that the experience be as good as the product
7529816 the other thing to remember comes directly out of what we know as pilates professionals it is all about balance and oppositional forces so while we may be experiencing a financial contraction that means there is an opening somewhere for us either now or in the future it is our job to find it
7529817 the magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away

7529825 this is the first time that walling and avg have appeared on the gsa schedule so this contract is an important milestone for both our companies
7529826 it opens up an entirely new sales channel and is a huge vote of confidence by the u s government that taxpayer dollars for government information security solutions will be well spent with walling data
7529827 walling has a proven track record in introducing avg to new markets and providing superior customer services so they are well positioned to help avg enter this exciting new area
7529828 we anticipate a number of government organizations will join the existing avg user base of 70 million around the world avg is preferred by many organizations thanks to its robust unobtrusive protection low system resource use and competitive pricing add wallings comprehensive support services and you have a very compelling offering
7529829 the channel has become an increasingly important part of our business avg has made major investments to meet the unique needs of our partners and support them in successfully delivering on their customers security needs
7529830 we are extremely pleased with this latest recognition a proof point that our commitment to the channel is producing concrete results we will continue to work closely with our worldwide partners to best meet business and technological objectives
7529831 the real time protection against drive by downloads is especially critical for business customers
7529832 because whenever a user surfs the internet they create a trusted yet insecure communications tunnel that generally bypasses the network firewall and therefore exposes the business to these new web borne threats
7529833 the markets going to struggle until we get a clear indication that we know what the bottom is in the financials and that may be a while
7529834 our biggest concern for 2009 earnings estimates is that a combination of global growth slowdown declining operating leverage a stronger u s dollar less share count reduction and a long tail to dysfunctional credit markets will create powerful headwinds for what appear to very optimistic consensus expectations
7529835 the closure of columbian bank awakened investors bad memories and shows that we are not through with the topic yet
7529836 were delighted to finally have a way to work more closely with our customers and prospects in the nordic region
7529837 we look forward to significantly increasing our business in this important market particularly with the newly released avg 8 0 products for business and home users

7529839 the product is already very well known here thanks to the high quality of the products and great support from the people at avg
7529840 is obama bashing american dream by bashing mccains 7 homes
7529841 i see am not alone there is this whole bunch of varied group and thats when my thinking cells awake and start noting few things now let me blog down few of my notes
7529842 you wont believe what biden just said turn on the tv
7529843 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
7529844 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
7529845 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
7529846 gone are the days when the mother was at home during the day and had time to visit the churchs coffee mornings and mother and toddler groups
7529847 with the pressures women face churches must adapt to make themselves more accessible
7529848 what this research reveals is that a lot of people are put off by traditional stances and attitudes we still have a long way to go before women particularly young women feel as included in the church as men do
7529849 im absolutely convinced that when we have women as bishops that it will send out a very clear message that women are as valued as much as men
7529850 mommy does it say or does it say in that song
7529851 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7529852 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7529853 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
7529854 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
7529855 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won
7529856 stands for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
7529857 every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
7529858 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
7529859 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
7529860 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
7529861 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7529862 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7529863 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7529864 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7529865 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7529866 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
7529867 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
7529868 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
7529869 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state
7529870 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
7529871 russian tanks rolling through georgia with images of chechnya in 1994 and 99 vilnius 91 afghanistan 79 prague 68 hungary 56 and before that poland the baltics and other eastern european states
7529872 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
7529873 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
7529874 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7529875 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7529876 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7529877 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7529878 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7529879 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia
7529880 the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
7529881 any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
7529882 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
7529883 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
7529884 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7529885 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7529886 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7529887 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7529888 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7529889 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7529890 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7529891 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7529892 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7529893 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7529894 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7529895 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks
7529896 to deter looters and the transportation of arms and ammunition
7529897 the eurasian corridor pipeline geopolitics and the new cold war
7529898 intimately related to the control over energy pipeline and transportation corridors and cites evidence that the georgian august 7 attack was carefully planned in high level consultations between us and nato officials
7529899 coordinat ion with natos plans to strengthen its black sea naval presence
7529900 silk road strategy the trans eurasian security system as an essential building block of post cold war us foreign policy
7529901 an energy and transport corridor network linking western europe to central asia and eventually to the far east
7529902 effective cooperation in politics trade and economy science and technology
7529903 we all see the speeches the protests the major events that are taken in by the cameras of major networks at every convention

7529924 halfway through their second to last song the keyboardist finally showed the lead singer forgot to tell the guitarist what songs they were playing and the air conditioning less tiny and quite fantastic music venue in the les made the entire band sweat profusely but the fedora clad barefoot jeff fiorello led his band through a pretty amazing set
7529925 god damn this is a great song how could someone not fall hopelessly in love with this song
7529926 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7529927 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7529928 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7529929 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7529930 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7529931 the new policy would let agents open preliminary terrorism investigations after mining public records and intelligence to build a profile of traits that taken together were deemed suspicious
7529932 travel to regions of the world known for terrorist activity and access to weapons or military training along with the persons race or ethnicity
7529933 long term surveillance interviewing neighbors and work mates recruiting informants and searching commercial databases for information on people
7529934 race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
7529935 pretext interviews in which agents do not honestly represent themselves while questioning a subjects neighbors and work colleagues
7529936 although we have not traditionally worked with congress in developing attorney general guidelines and as you note in your letter we are not obligated to do so we appreciate the laudable and thoughtful suggestions we have already received
7529937 continue to train fbi employees in preparation for the october 1 2008 implementation date
7529938 undercover new york police officers infiltrated protest groups before the 2004 republican national convention california state agents eavesdropped on peace animal rights and labor activists
7529939 denver police spied on amnesty international and others before being discovered
7529940 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
7529941 the same information is gathered about foreign travelers but it is held for 75 years
7529942 tough foreign policy that is neither republican nor democratic but is a strong smart american foreign policy to make our country more secure and advance our interests in the world
7529943 and john mccain should endorse president bushs efforts to oppose russias actions and form a bipartisan stand on this issue it is unfortunate that some of the candidates supporters are engaging in pointless criticism of each others public statements on the georgia crisis
7529944 i never thought in a million years that i was ever going to have a problem with working and making money
7529945 it was either pay one bill or pay another or not eat or not have a roof over my head
7529946 hes had a lot of problems paying his loans back and hes spent an awful lot of time out there talking about his problems rather than trying to pay his loans back
7529947 the cases are so harsh in measuring what an undue hardship is that anybody who is working and maintaining any kind of home life has very little chance of discharging these things in bankruptcy
7529948 at the time that people graduate from school almost everybody is technically eligible for bankruptcy because they have debts that exceed their assets
7529949 why would anyone lend you money if you had the option to walk away
7529950 what wed like to see is that people who have made a good faith effort to repay their student loans but for whatever reasons have hit a hard patch or hit a difficult stretch that there be some flexibility
7529951 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
