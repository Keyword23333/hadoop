2990033 threatens to undermine the stability of the international security system
2990034 what is really real or fake for this sort of thing anyway
2990035 we definitely arent in the business of tricking people they are a band they are playing their own music how are they any different from the pussycat dolls or any other band thats produced
2990036 its always been a dream of mine to get them on a late night talk show
2990037 the way the storyline plays out theyre traveling around the country because they got a letter saying they are invited to play on letterman i wont give away what happens but the whole idea of them actually playing on a late night talk show is perfect
2990038 its a fake band born out of an internet show but what if it became a real band our philosophy is to get the content out wherever people are watching
2990039 traditional media people look in horror at new media like im holding up a cheese grater in front of their infants

2990058 our disinfection systems sell themselves which is allowing us to outpace our sales for 2007 this year this is a client familiar with eco safe so when they expanded into a new facility more than twice their original size they did not hesitate to purchase a 50 000 system
2990059 this client processes and prepares pre packaged seafood products for major u s retail outlets including one of the leading u s grocery chains so product quality and safety are extremely important issues they leased one of our smaller systems for use in their original location for a number of years so they were quite familiar with the many advantages of eco safe ozone disinfection systems
2990060 todays market should also be viewed as fertile ground for opportunity
2990061 the mortgage turmoil doesnt seem to be going away anytime soon

2990064 the market has been hammered by bad loans but we take pride in a hands on approach to getting borrowers back in the market be that through new loan terms or some debt forgiveness we can help turnaround a dim outlook and turn a profit at the same time

2990068 in this our second full quarter as a public company i am very pleased with the performance of each of our business units and the progress each has made in executing our long term strategic goals
2990069 we had a strong second quarter particularly in our international operations where we exceeded our performance targets on our magnox contracts in the united kingdom resulting in increased efficiency fees earned by the company during the quarter
2990070 stronger than expected performance this quarter together with accelerated performance of commercial service contracts during the first quarter will level out our earnings between the first half and second half of the year
2990071 this is contrary to our forecasts at the beginning of the year when we expected greater sales and earnings in the second half we still estimate our full year revenues should be in the range of 1 8 billion to 1 9 billion and earnings per share should be in the range of 0 69 to 0 74 excluding approximately 1 6 million of expenses related to the companys secondary offering completed on july 31 2008 we expect earnings per share before the impact of non cash amortization of intangible assets should be in the range of 0 89 to 0 94 excluding offering expenses

2990087 have been postulated to play a very important role in neurocommunication but in this field essentially no critical studies have been performed to address this issue
2990088 so i set up an experiment to create an animal model in which a particular group of neurons in the brain couldnt release a small neurotransmitter and by examining those animal models i could know the function of those molecules
2990089 we found that the mice without gaba release from agrp neurons have increased energy expenditure and are resistant to diet induced obesity
2990090 the function of agrp neurons is probably to reserve the energy for maintaining life
2990091 so if the animal doesnt have enough food the animal should have some strategy to preserve energy and this group of neurons by releasing gaba restrains energy expenditure to maintain enough energy to survive under the conditions in which food is not readily available
2990092 i think it makes the role of gaba in obesity much more relevant than previously thought
2990093 but i felt good in the water and i said alright lets go
2990094 now one of them is a mild mannered pol from north carolina big deal most everyone else gets mystes john dunne id say youre dead on except for the fact that there are about 5 people stuffed december 2007 2

2990096 and obama has said over and over again that offshore drilling will not have any significant impact on us oil production or prices at the pump but he recognizes that the republicans have decided to drown out all debate by endlessly shouting the new newt gingrich mantra
2990097 the failure of the plutonium fuel experiment is another major setback for the mox program
2990098 to go forward with mox now areva would have to redesign the mox fuel and duke would have to repeat the entire experiment delaying the testing program by at least eight years doe should instead dispose of the plutonium directly by mixing it with radioactive waste and encasing it in glass which would be safer and cheaper than continuing the mox program
2990099 he who answers a matter before he hears the facts it is folly and shame to him
2990100 i havent stolen your coin so why should i be subjected to such an indignity
2990101 then theres only one thing left to do no one must leave this table until the police arrive
2990102 why were you so stubborn about being searched why did you refuse what was the big deal
2990103 no one would have believed me especially because i kept quiet in the beginning the fact is i am also a collector of coins and the coin that you have is not the only one in existence there is a duplicate that i bought two weeks ago in paris i thought mine was the only one at the time i brought it here to show everyone today its in my pocket right now but i didnt say anything about it because i didnt want to dampen your enthusiasm now who would have believed what i just said 10 minutes ago

2990113 so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom those who wish to tyrannize will do so for tyrants are active and ardent and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods religious and otherwise to put shackles upon sleeping men
2990114 it is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches and would like esau sell your country for a mess of pottage and like judas betray your god for a few pieces of money
2990115 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events

2990129 that prime time tv is actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light
2990130 i think clearly in this case its one where the agenda is very clear that they dont want to depict happily married couples in a normal healthy loving monogamous way
2990131 the only solution is to elect more pro abortion politicians
2990132 corrective statements should be made by roman catholic church authorities who realize that pelosis words are creating confusion and scandal not only among catholics but also among the population at large
2990133 a victim of the philosophy undergirding the 1960s sexual revolution
2990134 the killing of an innocent child is incompatible with receiving communion which is receiving the body of christ
2990135 since pro abortion politicians continue to persist in their support for abortion we persist in calling on every american bishop to enforce church law and deny these men and women holy communion
2990136 this one shocked me over anything and now were up to over 1 3 million raised just here in northern california against this proposition
2990137 people in other states who are just hanging out and im really just speaking to christians because theres nothing i can do about non christians and the gays theyve already kind of made up their mind they need to get involved they need to be aware
2990138 damit hat gm an weniger als 70 arbeitstagen mehr geld vernichtet als die deutsche lufthansa und der dax konzern henkel zusammen wert sind
2990139 beim thema mobilit t sind die amerikaner in einigen bereichen deutlich ins hintertreffen geraten
2990140 nehmen wir das beispiel flugverkehr die verdoppelung des kerosinpreises innerhalb nur eines jahres bringt eine ganze branche in turbulenzen die amerikaner sind hier schlecht aufgestellt weil ihre flugzeuge teilweise technisch veraltet sind und zu viel treibstoff schlucken auf dem automobilsektor hat man hnliche fehler begangen und massenweise spritfresser produziert aufgrund der gestiegenen benzinpreise ndert sich aber auch das k uferverhalten in den vereinigten staaten nur k nnen die us autobauer jetzt nicht den hebel schnell umlegen vor allem die japaner aber auch die europ er behaupten in puncto modernerer technik einen vorsprung von einigen jahren
2990141 schon jetzt stehen investitionen an deutschen standorten in frage ford will gro e teile der motorenproduktion von k ln in die walachei auslagern und dass gm angesichts der milliardenverluste berhaupt noch genug puste hat um die versprochenen 640 millionen euro in das bochumer opel werk zu investieren glaubt immerhin die opel pressestelle viele beobachter jedoch nicht

2990206 ethanol does nothing to reduce fuel consumption nothing to increase our energy independence nothing to improve air quality
2990207 i support ethanol and i think it is a vital a vital alternative energy source not only because of our dependency on foreign oil but its greenhouse gas reduction effects
2990208 i still dont support the subsidies and i dont think we need them and i think we ought to have sugar cane based ethanol into this country and i dont think that subsidies are the answer
2990209 setting a spin off series of spooks in 2013 as britain regroups after terrorists nuked london during the previous years olympic games might be an innovative if somewhat scary notion but theres more to spooks code 9 than just a tv show about the new breed of counter terrorist operative while the spying game is played out on screen viral marketing and high concept interactive elements are extending the story and the brand to the online community bbc3 already home to multi platform shows like lily allen and friends are rolling out the techie tricks to drama at libertynews co uk a website purporting to belong to a future news agency news sport and entertainment stories from 2013 abound we can see the extent of the radioactive exclusion zone in london and discover which landmarks were damaged in the bomb blast amy winehouse adds her voice to the london relief effort displaced football teams arsenal and chelsea have been relocated to spain and eastenders characters re emerge in post nuke soap camp 136 the world of spooks code 9 is fleshed out interactively online and we can place ourselves in this alternate reality conversing with its inhabitants and trying to spot the seeds of future spooks code 9 storylines members of the online community can even role play and share their 2013 stories and photos when major events occur on our tv screens whether its a bad guy being bagged or a good guy being blasted to kingdom come this is a spooks spin off so we cant expect the whole team to survive the series additional information will filter through via news reports on the site but will it work ive seen a preview and the show is disappointing but with such energy fizzing throughout its online extensions the question is no longer what these web offerings can add to the television experience rather will the televisual adventures of these maverick young mi5 operatives live up to spooks code 9s multi layered web of online activity

2990216 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2990217 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2990218 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2990219 you told me more about the process than i know
2990220 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2990221 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2990222 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2990223 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2990224 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2990225 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores

2990228 fatsoenlijk naar school gaan was er niet meer bij ze hadden iedere keer concerten voor me geboekt elk weekend reden we door duitsland om schnabbels af te werken want daar betaalden ze twee keer zo veel voor een optreden door alle toestanden heb ik drie keer in de zesde klas gezeten niet omdat ik niet kon leren maar omdat ze bang waren dat ze me niet meer zo makkelijk voor optredens uit de klas konden weghouden als ik naar de middelbare school zou gaan
2990229 in een caf spraken gert timmerman en hij af dat essing me voor 25
2990230 door alle aandacht die ik kreeg was ik ook geen makkelijk kind als ik de jurk waarop ik mijn zinnen had gezet niet kreeg vertikte ik het om het toneel op te gaan omdat ik altijd in het middelpunt stond werd ik een eigenwijze puber

2990232 veel te jong natuurlijk maar na die jaren waarin ik steeds zo heen en weer was geslingerd verlangde ik naar vastigheid en regelmaat
2990233 de eerste jaren na het succes keek ik om in wrok ik was kwaad omdat ze mijn jeugd van me hadden afgenomen het was voor mij onmogelijk mijn leven na alle onrust weer opnieuw op de rails te krijgen het zingen was altijd een mooie uitlaatklep geweest maar alle verplichtingen en aandacht hadden me emotioneel aangegrepen die klap kwam extra hard aan omdat ik nooit een veilig thuis had waar ik mijn gevoel kwijt kon
2990234 mijn zonen doen het allebei goed en ik ben oma van een prachtige kleindochter ik leef van de bijstand het is niet veel maar ik heb het goed en gezellig

2990251 when i was down on the ground i remembered the tibetan people all over the world
2990252 we proudly displayed the tibetan flag in beijing yesterday to shine a spotlight on the chinese governments lethal military crackdown inside tibet and its attempt to use the beijing olympics to cover up its human rights abuses there
2990253 as long as people of conscience actively support tibetans in their struggle for freedom and human rights pressure on china to resolve the issue will continue to grow
2990254 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
2990255 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
2990256 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
2990257 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
2990258 what clinched it for us was that the name mihai means who is like the lord
2990259 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer

2990309 thats one of the cool things again about the wolfenstein universe we go back and we pull some of these things from real history and spin this what if story for some of it and some of it just kind of blows out
2990310 so like the kreisau circle originally is more of a group of aristocrats working behind the scenes in hopes to overthrow hitler here theyre gun toting resistance forces fighting on the streets but its kind of nice to take those elements have a framework of reality and build it out

2990325 the beauty of a non violent activity is that we win no matter what if we break the siege we win and even if they arrest us we win because this will expose the face of the occupation and prove israel is still an occupier in gaza
2990326 we believe israel will not be able to stop us there
2990327 i see this is as a mission also as an israeli who is saying that the occupation is destroying all of us we hoped that more israelis from the peace movements would come
2990328 there is no coming to terms with palestinians attacks on civilian populations in sderot

2990410 i knew the pace was about right i wanted to see it break i was just saying go on keep going keep going break it broke right left and got just inside the left half and dropped very nice
2990411 the fans joined in with u s a chants and even started some of their own
2990412 i feel as though we didnt play usa volleyball today
2990413 n o entraremos na regi o georgiana de zugdidi suficiente temos com nosso territ rio

2990417 mesmo se as atividades de campanha do partido democrata do condado n o forem t o eficazes por causa da investiga o isso n o nos afetar em demasia
2990418 funcion rios do condado que lidavam com assuntos partid rios durante o expediente
2990419 sei de cora o que n o fiz nada de errado para justificar esse tipo de investiga o
2990420 tenho plena certeza de que quando a poeira baixar meu nome e reputa o ser o limpos
2990421 quando existe uma investiga o federal em curso amigos e conhecidos desaparecem
2990422 kerry venceu de lavada no condado de cuyahoga mas n o foi o bastante
2990423 isso significa que obama precisa vencer por uma margem ainda maior

2990426 pessoas centrais das atividades democratas est o se retirando da campanha pois muitos volunt rios s o oficiais e funcion rios p blicos
2990427 existia uma paran ia generalizada de que eles pegariam algu m de qualquer jeito

2990435 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
2990436 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
2990437 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2990438 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2990439 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2990440 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2990441 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
2990442 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
2990443 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
2990444 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
2990445 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
2990446 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
2990447 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
2990448 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
2990449 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
2990450 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality
2990451 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
2990452 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
2990453 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
2990454 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
2990455 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
2990456 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
2990457 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
2990458 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
2990459 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
2990460 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
2990461 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
2990462 uma pena que alguns de nossos aliados n o nos ajudem mas tentam colocar empecilhos refiro me tamb m transfer ncia por avi es de transporte militar dos estados unidos do contingente militar da ge rgia do iraque praticamente at a zona do conflito

2990468 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
2990469 it was a lot cheaper in the north maybe half the price youd go up buy a box of cork amp kerry creameries butter bring it back to dublin and give it to people they would go up another time and bring you back butter
2990470 you would often see fellas running across the fields with televisions kettles toasters anything they could bring back into the south they went across the fields to avoid the customs but sometimes youd see the customs fellas running after them they never got your parents butter though
2990471 ive been to sainsburys in newry late some saturdays and shelves were stripped bare the car park is always full of cars with southern registrations
2990472 the town is dying around us and theres nothing we can do about it dundalk is like a ghost town now compared to how it used to be no one shops here anymore why would they when they can get everything cheaper just 10 miles up the road

2990483 my wife and i have come to reside in england
2990484 he is certainly going to use his foreign base to influence thailands domestic politics
2990485 there may be a serious conflict in the long run that results in extreme violence if some decide they cannot rely on the judiciary for justice
2990486 still has influence over this government and is pulling the strings
2990487 i thought i would be able to prove my innocence and receive justice which is why i returned to thailand on feb 28 but the situation has deteriorated
2990488 i have also constantly received news that my life is not safe wherever i travel i have to use bulletproof cars this is the result i got from having volunteered to serve the country the king and the people
2990489 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2990490 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
2990491 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
2990492 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2990493 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2990494 adjusting and constantly evolving expanding and trying to stay as young as i can
2990495 could use a little more substance like we had in the day
2990496 theyre standing on our shoulders some of them dont realize it because they sample me so much
2990497 i started to walk out i thought it was a disney thing i had never heard of this thing
2990498 toward the opening i started having trepidations oh my god what have i done ive ruined my career but when it aired the ratings went through the roof
2990499 i went back on speaking engagements and encouraged african americans to go to africa to interact socially culturally and or economically
2990500 im pretty excited to have the first one under my belt
2990501 when you consider the circumstances everything around it to swim like that under that sort of expectation and pressure is pretty amazing
2990502 going into the ready room i started getting these kind of like chills up my body
2990503 right then and there i knew i was starting to get more and more excited i was pretty emotional after that race
2990504 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2990505 los hechos se relataron en forma de noticiario narrando la ca da de meteoritos que posteriormente corresponder an a los contenedores de naves marcianas que derrotar an a las fuerzas norteamericanas
2990506 we have seen steady and material deceleration in googs organic revenue growth
2990507 you have to remember that in the 1990s missile defense was still a science project
2990508 we were still in the research and development stage this changed after withdrawing from the abm treaty anti ballistic missile treaty of 1972 and we had to a do a lot of adapting with what was currently in inventory
2990509 this development and testing success is a win win for the united states and the international community because it means we have an additional layer that is mobile throughout the oceans of the world makes our armed forces allies and populations around the globe safer
2990510 this near term naval system can also be used if necessary to defend the cities and areas near the coastlines of the united states from asymmetrical container or barge ship threats with short range ballistic missiles
2990511 we are worried here at heritage about a scud or cruise missile launched from a ship say 300 miles off the u s coast
2990512 the primary issue is the sensor question and having a mechanism in place that can detect such a launch very quickly and bring forces to bear that can knock it down
2990513 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
2990514 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
2990515 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2990516 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
2990517 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
2990518 alain is wounded when you are the last swimmer in a relay and that you have the opportunity to bring a title of this importance to your country you dont get out of this unhurt
2990519 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
2990520 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2990521 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her
2990522 but i got a bronze yesterday and a silver this morning if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
2990523 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
2990524 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2990525 thats a hell of a swim and he is a true champion
2990526 natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning
2990527 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final

2990531 reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed
2990532 i spoke with kaka yesterday we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2990533 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea
2990534 the clubs position remains unchanged milan have said that the player is not for sale so we are not in negotiations with them
2990535 normally milan do not sell their best players we think they like the proposal but it is not so easy for them to accept it for now we must just wait and see

2990537 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
2990538 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2990539 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders
2990540 natural selection codes for survival not comfort this gene although uncomfortable could be beneficial to survival

2990634 fue muy impactante ver la enorme multitud de gentes de todo el mundo que estaban all y la fraternidad que se respiraba en el ambiente y con la que todo el mundo nos trataba
2990635 no cur f sicamente mi lesi n en la zona lumbar pero s me report una paz como nunca antes hab a sentido lo que hace que d a a d a pueda afrontar mis fuertes dolores con alegr a y serenidad
2990636 we wouldnt be able to go and watch them as the train station will not sell us any train tickets so i dont really care
2990637 the slogan is now about a safe olympics and of course in the chinese way of doing things they impose more restrictions
2990638 and even if they are just buddist monks religious forces are always regarded by the as one of the political threats to the regime
2990639 they always come to ask us where have you been and who have you talked to
2990640 people say things will get better after the olympics but im not so sure
2990641 part of this has to do with our role models our parents
2990642 but another part has to do with practicality we naturally gravitate toward things were good at
2990643 you dont have to do the same chores but you should sweat equally
2990644 el segundo nombre es siempre un asunto colateral a la historia pero que representa una encrucijada en la vida del protagonista y eso sucede en a diferencia de otros relatos ste tiene una fuerte carga religiosa pero el asunto central es como siempre la evoluci n psicol gica del protagonista el grial de chr tien parece una excusa para explicar el desarrollo espiritual del h roe pero no el centro del relato

2990647 we are talking about parenting early childhood development and investing in programs and supports that go to the heart of intervention and prevention
2990648 it means investing early right at the beginning of a childs life investing in the right supports and interventions to keep kids out of for example the juvenile justice system
2990649 we can no longer look at the early years from just an education or care perspective alone we are taking a holistic approach to childhood development and care including the physical and mental well being of the child to truly give them the best start in life
2990650 queensland is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse states in australia
2990651 more than 40 per cent of queenslanders were born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas and more than 270 languages are spoken in this state
2990652 thats why queensland health has a multicultural action plan focused on tackling health care challenges posed by language barriers and different cultural belief systems
2990653 among its initiatives is the appointment of a multicultural health coordinator to liaise between health staff and the local community
2990654 it has also led to the establishment of a bi lingual health promoter project to act as a bridge between various cultural communities and queensland health
2990655 what makes this festival so important is that this health district on brisbanes southside receives the largest number of refugees in queensland
2990656 we established the logan refugee health clinic two years ago and since then we have conducted more than 800 refugee health assessments
2990657 this program conducts health assessments for all refugees humanitarian entrants temporary protection visa holders and refugee claimants and we are now establishing the brisbane south refugee clinic
2990658 demand for health services is growing rapidly and its vital we continue to provide health services and health advice in a culturally appropriate manner
2990659 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor

2990663 the arrangement is the first mechanism of its kind and we are very proud of this historic step american charities for palestine acp will raise american charitable contributions and will work with usaid to direct these funds to support ongoing projects in the field
2990664 through acp and as a result of this memorandum of understanding generous americans can donate to palestinian development with confidence that their money will go to worthwhile projects in accordance with u s law
2990665 today is the first step our immediate next step is to finalize robust administrative and financial structures to carry our mission forward
2990666 whether it is our emergency medical assistance programs maternal and child health care programs our early education activities or the education initiatives that are part of the u s palestinian partnership usaid is actively committed to improving the lives of palestinians
2990667 essential for building the foundations of a palestinian state as part of realizing the visions of an end of conflict based on two states palestine and israel living side by side in peace and security
2990668 i believe that there could be no greater legacy for america than to help to bring into being a palestinian state for a people who have suffered too long who have been humiliated too long who have not reached their potential for too long and who have so much to give to the international community and to all of us i promise you my personal commitment to that goal
2990669 rice affirms u s commitment to creation of a palestinian state
2990670 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2990671 i want to reiterate on bushs behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate cease fire
2990672 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2990673 in view of russias past provocative actions in south ossetia including the recent overflight of the region by russian warplanes on july 8th moscow has a particular obligation to avoid further escalation of the situation
2990674 maintaining the territorial integrity of georgia is crucial to preserving stability in the region
2990675 tenemos un idioma propio igual que los vascos y catalanes
2990676 the language in there is so similar to the language in the left behind books
2990677 it focuses the mind and revitalizes the body and dammit you never know when youre going to die
2990678 launched through their car windshields on impact or randomly caught in gang crossfire or even collapsed of heart failure on filthy gas station bathroom tile i bet they didnt sit at their breakfast tables with a short glass of o j that morning before leaving home and consider the possibility that they might not ever be coming back again so if you ponder at least for a few minutes every morning the idea i am going to die today i am going to die today i am going to die you can be sure you can know with 100 certainty that you wont
2990679 the punishment must reflect the gravity of the crime and deter others who would consider it

2990684 such a cloak could hide any object so well that observers would be totally unaware of its presence according to the researchers
2990685 it would act like youve opened up a hole in space
2990686 researchers at the university of california in berkeley have developed a material that can bend light around 3d objects making them disappear
2990687 cloaking uses materials known as metamaterials to deflect radar light or other waves around an object like water flowing around a smooth rock in a stream
2990688 metamaterials are mixtures of metal and circuit board materials such as ceramic teflon or fiber composite they are designed to bend visible light in a way that ordinary materials dont scientists are trying to use them to bend light around objects so they dont create reflections or shadows
2990689 it differs from stealth technology which does not make an aircraft invisible but reduces the cross section available to radar making it hard to track

2990696 i think theres a lot of hype around the area
2990697 i think we have to be very careful about saying theres a whole new revolutionary period ahead with stem cells embryonic stem cells
2990698 i think in many ways whats going to happen is going to be much more modest so that stem cells will be used for trialling or testing out toxicity of drugs for example
2990699 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
2990700 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2990701 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
2990702 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2990703 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2990704 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
2990705 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
2990706 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2990707 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2990708 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2990709 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2990710 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2990711 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2990712 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2990713 its exciting because weve found a compound in nature that may one day surpass a currently marketed drug or could become the structural template for rationally designed drugs with improved selectivity
2990714 the ocean is a genetically distinct environment and the single most diverse source of new molecules to be discovered

2990755 pensions and salaries are not both compensation for the same job theyre compensation for two different jobs
2990756 to find good interims you need someone who doesnt need a steady income retirees are perfect
2990757 the interim comes in does the difficult things no one wants to be blamed for and then steps aside
2990758 this is a very good deal and its really aimed at making it worth your while to retire as early as you can
2990759 when people retire that early theyre not ready to stop working
2990760 its completely understandable that if they actually have talent that is in short supply theyd seek to come back keep working and get a payment on both sides
2990761 the pension system is the problem when you have a pension system that encourages people to retire in their mid 50s you cant complain about double dipping

2990765 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
2990766 branson should use the competitive threat to his own advantage and do something similar

2990801 i went to the mayo clinic and the doctors said we have found a dozen or so other people with this theres no name so maybe well just call it the warren syndrome
2990802 my dog was starting to bleed and it was starting to get completely out of control so i mean at that point thats when i sort of lost it and started to defend myself and my property
2990803 i believe in education if people have access to education they can make a difference in their lives particularly women
2990804 it was so difficult to convince the parents they want their children to speak portuguese as soon as possible the language which is perceived as superior parents think that when their children speak the vernacular they will remain as poor as they are
2990805 i was accused by people in the ministry that i wanted to delay the childrens development but i just wanted to make it easier for the child
2990806 i feel very frustrated in many aspects of my professional life most people in authority are not interested in changing things but i think i am a fighter i believe we can achieve lots of things in life by being honest fighting for our ideals and not thinking of ourselves but the next generation and the women people deserve a better life
2990807 teresa realized that her husband had cheated on her for long but as a literate woman she was now able to make her own decisions
2990808 i believe in education if people have access to education they can make a difference in their lives particularly women
2990809 but they insisted i am the right person so i accepted
2990810 the situation for girls is getting more and more difficult we still have a huge deficit of teachers some have to teach 100 kids per class people are contracted as teachers without training or are just trained for a few days the girls are harassed and abused by teachers but the worst thing is that no one considers it a serious issue
2990811 my task was to help poor communities to get access to education water sanitation and health to get empowered when you have women educated when they can make a choice between three or eight children when they have opportunities they will look at life in a different way
2990812 many women needed to learn how to use water and how to prevent diseases some did not know how to prepare balanced diets
2990813 a certain woman in her forties was considered crazy in her village nobody respected her then she learned to read and her life was turned around now she can read the bible in church
2990814 what i consider as an achievement is the fact i have reached a point where people acknowledge that i am a good professional in my area
2990815 there is no doubt i am against the indo us nuclear deal my point against the deal is that we must first deal with terrorism unless we do not deal with terrorism we would be planting nuclear bombs in the form of reactors
2990816 india has lost a lot to terrorism including two prime ministers the country still continues to suffer from terrorism
2990817 the world has not been able to find a solution to the nuclear waste problem
2990818 it would be unfair to the future generation to dump the nuclear wastes now and leave the problem unsolved
2990819 us president george bush may want to supply nuclear plants to india thats their business but opposition is in human interest
2990820 it is a manmade crisis and the investment bankers are responsible for it

2990825 we re certainly disappointed for re quan but we know that he ll do everything in his power to return to the field
2990826 we ll now turn to for senior leadership at running back and see who among the younger players will step forward and take advantage of this opportunity
2990827 it was hurting before i even came to beijing but its the olympics so you have to try and give it your best shot
2990828 the timing is very bad ive been on painkillers for the last six days and took four this morning but what worries me is that i could still feel it with that many painkillers
2990829 the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not
2990830 if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
2990831 require all recipients of aid under federal health programs to certify that they will not refuse to hire nurses and other providers who object to abortion and even certain types of birth control
2990832 an early draft of the regulation found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2990833 it contained words that led some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2990834 however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
2990835 why on earth is the bush administration trying to discourage doctors and clinics from providing contraception to women who need it
2990836 any entity taking federal funds has to comply with federal laws
2990837 to do anything less would be irresponsible we do think there should be regulations
2990838 it appears that the interaction of the abog bulletin for 2008 maintenance of certification with the acog ethics report would force physicians to violate their conscience by referring patients for abortions or taking other objectionable actions or risk losing their board certification
2990839 several months ago i became aware that certain medical specialty certification groups were adopting requirements which potentially violate a physicians right to choose whether he or she performs abortion
2990840 i wrote to the acog and abog protesting their actions frankly i found their response to be dodgy and unsatisfying i sent another letter more of the same
2990841 not only are there clear provisions in three separate laws protecting federally funded health care providers right of conscience but doing otherwise undermines the most fundamental moral underpinning of freedom of expression and action
2990842 i asked that regulations be drafted which would enforce these long standing laws protecting a medical practitioners conscience rights
2990843 we have formed more search teams which are scouring the thickly forested area of bailadila hills where we have some indication that the chopper crashed
2990844 we have to be careful while pushing for air surveillance its going at a slow pace as there is apprehension that maoists may use rocket launchers to shoot down the rescue team helicopter if it flies at a low altitude in the region

2990885 because this is a prepaid card the customer pays no interest on their balance
2990886 the difference with this card is that cordoba financial group does not earn any interest on the balance either
2990887 normally when someone puts money on a prepaid card the company that issues the card will earn interest on the balance until the person spends it

2990934 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2990935 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2990936 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2990937 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2990938 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2990939 i dont score many anyway but that definitely would be up there
2990940 im looking for a certain type of player to do a certain type of job

2990947 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2990948 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2990949 wir k nnen mit allen mithalten und brauchen uns vor keinem zu verstecken

2990955 he has started light training and will be back this week
2990956 we have to correct one or two things but we showed yesterday we are well prepared to play against the top teams
2990957 we didnt concede a goal the only downside is we didnt score but we created all sorts of opportunities so it was good
2990958 this is one for the good days and i have it all here on red blue green
2990959 you are my center when i spin away out of control on videotape
2990960 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2990961 lego batman is certainly the coolest character we have ever realised in lego form and robins not too shabby either
2990962 theyre both very cool athletic well trained martial artists and theyre ready to kick ass against the bad guys in gotham
2990963 these are the coolest characters that we have put into a lego game so far this is down to the fact that the batman universe offers us such a rich variety of characters to incorporate into the game
2990964 there are classic heroes and villains who have been part of batman lore for decades and were recreating them in lego form youll be able to play as the villains as well as the heroes which is great fun its an action packed adventure too lots of kicking lego ass as the dynamic duo and lots of mischief to create as the bad guys
2990965 our producer has some pretty surreal conversations with dc sometimes
2990966 theyre rightfully protective over batman who is their ultimate and coolest hero in my opinion and the universe that they have created around him so sometimes there may be things that we want to do in a lego batman videogame that any other batman might not have done without going into the details too much we hope that batman will be able to join robin in burning up the dance floor

2990979 we were attached to the air corps and did telephone and telegraph work for them
2990980 there was always a fear that someone was going to attack it because it was a main shipping line for the war effort
2990981 there were many gun embankments around it that had communication lines running between them that we had to repair or replace the natives made us go through the wire because they would steal it and use it on their thatch roofs
2990982 theyd come on base and do laundry some girls worked on the switchboard and some did kp for officers
2990983 i thought it would be soft with all the rain but it wasnt during the rainy season it rained everyday at 3 p m and we also had very high temperatures
2990984 we took pills for it malaria and had mosquito nets wed pull over us when we slept at night to try and keep the bugs away
2990985 i was there 13 months and it only rained once
2990986 the temperature wasnt too bad because we were right on the ocean
2990987 we had been together for a while and went to the same school
2990988 we got married in august 1943 and his dad died in december but he wasnt able to come home again
2990989 i moved to town lived with friends and worked in a doctors office i also helped my dad on his farm

2990991 i was going to be sent to california but between going there and leaving ecuador i got a months leave
2990992 they announced at the fair that the war was over and everyone went wild
2990993 we were fortunate during the war because we didnt have to worry about combat
2990994 we had enough to eat and a place to sleep the food wasnt the greatest but it kept us alive
2990995 i didnt have to worry about battle fatigue like some fellows did
2990996 there is one other guy from our group that i know of who is still living
2990997 i use to write to a couple of widows but even they are no longer living
2990998 nutrition exercise water sunshine temperance air rest and trust in god
2990999 we want to show people how to live better and more productive lives
2991000 i work in a nursing home and i see the difference in the quality of life between some of the people there and mr gardner
2991001 so many people are sick and it is sad that we know things that could make a difference
2991002 it is about living better feeling better and also about your mental health
2991003 its the only way we know of to have a voice in what happens in our village
2991004 theyre saying to the voters if you dissolve us youre going to have all this accrued liability if the village tries any more of their shenanigans we may very well need to go to court
2991005 historically interest in cooperative education increases when the economy slumps especially since it does seem to give people a leg up in the job market
2991006 the bottom line is that many companies wont even look at a graduate without work experience
2991007 it definitely helps financially and i dont have to worry about trying to work while taking classes
2991008 but most importantly i will have a year and a half of real world work experience when i graduate
2991009 our students are demanding an equal chance to gain experience in their areas of study
2991010 kids and their families are making an enormous investment in higher education and they clearly want there to be a payoff
2991011 we feel it is a fantastic selection process that gives us employees with a stronger early performance more familiarity with the company and the work and better retention
2991012 it is always good fellowship great food and i love seeing old friends here
2991013 it is kind of like a family thing everybody knows everybody and catching up with old friends
2991014 we had 98 drivers on saturday and we expect around the same as last year for sundays pull
2991015 i like it for the competitiveness and to be able to say that i beat my husband

2991017 it can be a challenge to get all 19 of our athlete players in a game each time we play
2991018 those traditional games will be held in stark county on august 21 and 25
2991019 softball has really been a big hit for the players
2991020 andy is one of the athletes and cory helps by being a partner
2991021 but ive also gotten hit with the ball once even in the head
2991022 when the first citizen himself is violating the law its a joke to ask the public to obey the law
2991023 they president rajapaksa and minister sirisena could attain godly status by taking action against minister silva
2991024 the conduct of the government is not 100 percent correct
2991025 my dear friend jaymes and i are so excited to announce the birth of parker foster aiken
2991026 mama jaymes is doing quite well also the aiken family the foster family and the parker family are all thrilled
2991027 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2991028 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2991029 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2991030 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2991031 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2991032 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2991033 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2991034 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2991035 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
2991036 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
2991037 check it out dustin hoffman rain man look retarded act retarded not retarded count toothpicks to your cards autistic sure not retarded you know tom hanks forrest gump slow yes retarded maybe braces on his legs but he charmed the pants off nixon and won a ping pong competition that aint retarded you went full retard man never go full retard
2991038 we dont believe there was any foul play based on the statements by family members that mr hayes had been treated of late for a number of medical issues we believe that led to his death today there are no plans for an autopsy
2991039 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2991040 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2991041 we took levi to a john mellencamp concert we want to make sure hes equipped to be around the sights and sounds of people everyone talked about how oh you have a kid life changes its like 180 degrees on a dime full stop and a lot of them had an insinuation under that like you have to stop living your life as you live it that hasnt been the case
2991042 genes and hormones may predispose a person to one sexuality rather than another but thats all predisposition and determination are two different things
2991043 if heterosexuality and homosexuality are indeed genetically predetermined how do we explain bisexuality or people who suddenly in mid life switch from heterosexuality to homosexuality or vice versa we cant
2991044 far more ambiguous blurred and overlapping than any theory of genetic causality can allow
2991045 examples of sexual flexibility dont square with genetic theories of rigid erotic predestination
2991046 to deny choice to make it appear that homosexuals cannot help it and to argue that any criticism of the gay lifestyle is as silly as criticism of being left handed or red haired
2991047 and this has been a deliberate strategy by homosexual activists they have done a very good job to convince a gullible public that homosexuals are born that way and cannot change
2991048 he used to tell my sisters and me a story when we were younger
2991049 i bet you are the guy from my dads story we were never quite sure how serious he was but mom never denied his words we used to joke it was too many magic mushrooms tease them yknow
2991050 shes a retired photo journalist these days so boy do i have to be careful considering what we do for a living
2991051 my dad lord knows what hed think if he knew the truth
2991052 took him long enough to accept that i wanted to be military but i wanted to go out there willingly so that people like him couldnt be conscripted against their will yknow
2991053 mind you wasnt easy to get taken all that seriously with a hippy name like mine but then thats still mum amp dad to this day took dad a while to get back to that way of thinking after nam but these days he and mum are just two happy old hippies
2991054 i had no idea but the longer i stayed on the job the more i wondered if my dads old story could be true
2991055 id never tell sir never i know the importance of some things and i know they weighed me up in the balance before letting me in on this program because my mother long ago had connections with the media
2991056 we need you youre pretty damn special if you were so checked and still accepted youve earned out trust because youre still here
2991057 his team leader will go jack hell get a proper escort

2991060 reynolds entrusted him to my care dammit his whole family michael and jenny entrusted him to my care they might not have realised it but this was the second time we asked them to trust us i didnt save michael in 1969 when he asked me to either it was no thanks to me that the guy lived and had three kids and its all thanks to me that he now only has the two he lost his only son daniel
2991061 i know but then or now none of it was your fault jack you did everything you could to prevent all you could
2991062 yes jack ive read the reports and i know you you did everything you could
2991063 god forbid if reynolds borrowed you on his sg team took you out and that happened i dont think id ever forgive him
2991064 there would be nothing to forgive jack just as there is nothing to forgive now reynolds does not blame you neither should he
2991065 ah but i bet michael and jenny are a different story

2991087 chevron was the company that built all the well sites all the production stations and employed a system that had as a waste disposal mechanism of dumping this water in the amazon waterway
2991088 it is intellectually dishonest to put blinders on and blame everything on a company that left 17 years ago
2991089 it is as if you gave me a car 17 years ago and i put no oil it and did no maintenance and came back to you and said you owe me a new car

2991093 senator obama continues to believe that this is a matter for the ecuadorian judicial system to adjudicate in a fair impartial and independent manner
2991094 we will be more than happy to come to a real court in the u s and expose the cases irregularities
2991095 what we are seeing now is a collision between a much higher level of political and social sensibilities and older legal regimes
2991096 this has made companies like chevron potentially liable under local laws
2991097 although the government cant interfere in the judicial matter we totally support the claim of our compatriots
2991098 the world needs to know what this company texaco did
2991099 judges fear ruling in any way that could be seen as going against correa
2991100 they know they can lose their position and that they can be called traitor to the country
2991101 for us what the press and public opinion say doesnt exist
2991102 the court despite being ecuadorian has the freedom to resolve according to what the judge considers is fair
2991103 the pollution is result of chevrons actions and not of petroecuador

2991106 we believe mac performance is due to several unique drivers that were not present in prior downturns we anticipate that apple will continue to grow at a multiple of the overall market for many years to come
2991107 first apple has successfully reduced the perceived and actual switching costs for windows users looking to adopt the mac platform second apples support of the intel architecture has leveled the playing field in terms of speeds and feeds comparisons between macs and pcs
2991108 finally apples successful retail strategy has broadened the availability of mac products and given apple more control over the critical computer selling process users can now explore the advantages of the mac platform with highly trained apple sales reps

2991140 farming and consuming more kangaroos instead of cattle and sheep will reduce carbon gas emissions

2991150 its unfortunate timing its very bad but theres nothing i can do
2991151 it is never a happy circumstance when a player is forced to withdraw from any tournament including the olympic tennis event
2991152 but i think it shows how important the olympics have become to our sport when players of the calibre of ana ivanovic and ivan ljubicic travelled all the way to beijing in the hope of being fit enough to compete for their countries
2991153 ive had surgery but this is a different problem they dont know what it is
2991154 its really hurting it was hurting before we came here but its the olympics and we always have to give it our best shot thats the reason im here
2991155 its the olympics it doesnt matter if its singles doubles mixed doubles or whatever
2991156 i couldnt sit home and say lets just play the us open for a tennis player a grand slam is a grand slam but for me the olympics is very special
2991157 me parece que el asunto de la seguridad p blica no es un asunto de un solo hombre o una sola mujer sino un asunto donde todos en este momento en los estados de la rep blica donde m s violencia hay pero sobre todo en el pa s nos quitemos la camiseta del color que sea y hagamos un gran pacto nacional contra la delincuencia y el crimen organizado porque los delincuentes no son m s que nosotros entonces tenemos que unirnos ante el crecimiento que est teniendo en el pa s
2991158 o nos ponemos de acuerdo en esto o el pa s no va avanzar en su econom a m s vale que lo digamos de manera clara ya no se trata de ver que inter s es el que debe privilegiarse es por supuesto el inter s nacional
2991159 pensamos que el gran problema de la inseguridad es la impunidad y la impunidad se da en los polic as en las c rceles ministerios p blicos y jueces entonces lo que tenemos que hacer ahora que ya paso la reforma constitucional es ir viendo cada uno de estos problemas desde el aspecto de su legislaci n
2991160 para el prd y todos los actores pol ticos y sociales el resultado de la consulta en la cual en el distrito federal participaron 826 mil ciudadanos y en conjunto a nivel nacional m s de un mill n 700 mil ciudadanos en esta primera etapa es un mandato la gente opin no a la participaci n del capital privado en pemex la gente opin no a la aprobaci n de la iniciativa del gobierno federal
2991161 lo que se traducir en informaci n sustantiva para combatir el crimen
2991162 se ha tenido el nivel de participaci n de la consulta pasada
2991163 alrededor del 90 por ciento de los votos emitidos rechazan la iniciativa del presidente felipe calder n
2991164 esto preocupa de sobremanera ya que los est ndares internacionales recomiendan que se debe tener una celda por interno y en los centros federales tenemos dos o tres internos por celda por lo que el hacinamiento provoca en muchas ocasiones motines
2991165 mientras no se vea como un derecho constitucional la seguridad privada en m xico seguir presentado ambig edades
2991166 la seguridad privada estuvo regulada hasta noviembre del 2000 por la secretar a de gobernaci n y por una serie de reformas a la ley org nica de la administraci n p blica federal se crea la secretaria de seguridad p blica federal que hoy encabeza el secretario garc a luna
2991167 a partir de esta reforma que no tuvo ning n sustento jur dico sino simplemente fue como otras cosas que se suelen despachar en el congreso sin an lisis acucioso se considero que la seguridad privada y los centros de readaptaci n no eran ya factores de gobernabilidad y por tanto no deb an estar bajo la direcci n de gobernaci n
2991168 porque la ssp no ha sido ni podr a ser un rgano de control a las exigencias que ahora tiene la seguridad privada
2991169 concluy que no hay una definici n constitucional de la seguridad privada y a lo m s que se lleg es a una declaraci n del presidente de la corte que dijo que probablemente puede haber una homologaci n con el derecho de leg tima defensa pero que no est claro el camino jur dico hacia empresas que otorga este tipo de servicios
2991170 no es una actividad de polic as sino preventiva y debe tener autonom a operativa y t cnica y no estar sometida a una administraci n de cuerpos de gendarmer a porque no hay absolutamente relaci n jur dica entre ambas figuras
2991171 no puede ser que cuerpos policiacos regulen a formas de organizaci n de la sociedad civil
2991172 definir un padr n de emergencia real donde ambas puedan coadyuvar de manera homologada
2991173 en est n iniciativa planteamos todos estos puntos antes descritos estamos impulsando la formaci n de una c mara de seguridad p blica porque hace falta que los empresarios sean un rgano de consulta del gobierno que sean los empresarios los que regulen a sus afiliados y tengan un padr n fehaciente de las empresas que operan
2991174 por lo delicado de sus tareas de proteger personas e instalaciones el estado debe tener claridad de cu les de estas empresas son legales y no est n lavando dinero ni est n vinculadas a esquemas de crimen organizado
2991175 lo nico que hacen es cobrar una serie de aranceles a las seguridad privada que son redundantes
2991176 no existe estad sticas fehaciente de cuantas empresas clandestinas operan en m xico porque no se tiene una c mara nacional de seguridad privada
2991177 no estamos exentos dice no se trata de fernando mart solamente sino que a diferentes niveles van apareciendo otras v ctimas un ejemplo es el de esta mujer con 10 meses de embarazo que fue encontrada muerta en el estado de m xico son casos de muestra
2991178 lo que tendr a que hacerse a ade es revisar el modelo penitenciario existente en donde no s lo hay sobrepoblaci n sino verdaderos niveles del posgrado para los delincuentes ah quien entra joven sale con buenas relaciones para incorporarse a otros niveles de la delincuencia es decir no readaptamos no prevenimos sino penalizamos y eso en ninguna experiencia del mundo logra disminuir los niveles delincuenciales

2991212 this is another in a range of disputes and deadlocks reached between the union and various companies and like most other disputes in the sector it is informed by low wage levels and declining living standards as a result of rising inflation interest rates increases in petrol and electricity prices and the explosion of increases in food prices

2991227 so this heres the question actually its the answer but that sounds lame
2991228 please rush he has asked the crew not to close doors till you come and if you delay he will write the delay of the aircraft on commercial you know how we get pulled up for it
2991229 as a matter of fact i did wanted to know why you are not in uniform and how you managed to come to the aircraft through the arrival hall
2991230 i want to know why you are not in uniform and one needs to come through the security hold you cannot carry your bag
2991231 i dont think this is the right time or place for these questions nor are you the concerned authority however having come so far let me appraise you that my job does not require me to wear a uniform unlike yours i have spent several years in all airports in the country monitoring service levels and have a valid photo id where i come or go is not your god dammed business
2991232 this chopra is going to pay for this these captains get away bullying the cabin crew and the new staff but today was his unlucky day
2991233 i heard about the incident i am really glad it happened to someone who i know will stand up against it these guys think they can do anything they want and get away with it
2991234 how can you not support me ive been working with you for so long and now this captain from outside is whom you are worried about
2991235 dont be silly i just want you to know what the consequences are going to be chopra is going to be hauled up and may lose his job after days of interrogation where you will obviously play the key role now if that is what you want then it is ok
2991236 you really think he will lose his job i dont want that i just wanted to teach him a lesson but not one so extreme
2991237 now common you should know better that that how things are dont you remember what happened to your friend think about it and act soon a fax message has already been dispatched to summoning chopra to head office after landing
2991238 oh no what do i do now wait i know ill call up my boss and explain things and ask him to handle it
2991239 i know what you guys are thinking that he deserves it and losing his job will not only teach him but also teach others a lesson it will boost the morale of all those women staff that has had to compromise on their dignity on various instances
2991240 yeah you could take it to the next stage maybe an interrogation and then let him off the hook there
2991241 let me just think about this awhile and refresh my head ill go and take a walk down stairs and pick up a coffee on the way
2991242 why is dominique not rostered to kolkata these days he hasnt come for quite some time
2991243 he got him self into real big trouble he has been grounded and there is an interrogation going on for the past month or so every few days there is a long meeting and the poor guy is so troubled
2991244 it is best that you ask him your self i will tell him that i met you and to call you
2991245 i didnt remember about it on landing but she did by the time i reached delhi that evening after the turnaround flight there was a fax message in the delhi operations office a complaint that i had sexually harassed her on board and had shown her obscene literature on the fight
2991246 now where the hell did you get obscene literature on board
2991247 so you can imagine how ridiculous that is she claims there were some obscene pictures in the magazines on board which i showed her with the intent to harass and she was helpless helpless my foot there were six crew members on board and no one supposedly saw me showing her anything
2991248 she is from chennai and i have heard that she just got married against her parents wishes and her husband is jobless she was afraid that if i complained she would lose her job or be in the bad books of senior management she thought it easier to complain about me to safe guard herself
2991249 not really but just talking to you was the biggest help and the fact that you believe me is the most i could expect it means so much what more can i say
2991250 ive known dominique for a long time and he is not a guy who would do what he has been accused of he has been framed it is not just the job that he loses he also loses his reputation and his self esteem does it not mean anything to you
2991251 you may be right and i believe him too i am more helpless than all of you as i cannot do a thing to save him it is only the girl who complained who can
2991252 i hereby take back my complaint the incident that i mentioned did take place after some thought i realized that the intention was not to harass and may have been in humor i took offence and would therefore expect an apology

2991256 following the match against argentina on saturday bakkies botha had a scan and he has ruptured his posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee
2991257 we will adopt a conservative management process which means bakkies will not undergo surgery but will rather complete a rehabilitation process
2991258 fourie had a head clash with the argentina wing a scan has shown he has a depressed fracture of his cheekbone and he will undergo surgery before the end of the week which means he will be out for six weeks post surgery

2991274 i knew he was a friend of ms hunter and he asked me to come and meet with them and i said no
2991275 i said whats the purpose of the meeting and the bottom line was that he said the purpose of the meeting was she was having some trouble she just wanted to talk wanted me to talk to him and to her about what their circumstances were
2991276 bob is a really pleasant guy very interested in the community
2991277 the only thing that stood out about him was that he was often up early in the morning doing work around the house i learned recently too that he and his wife took care of a relative in their home for a long time a relative who was dying of cancer

2991295 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
2991296 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
2991297 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mindset

2991332 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2991333 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2991334 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2991335 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2991336 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2991337 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2991338 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2991339 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2991340 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2991341 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2991342 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2991343 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

2991404 one of the most common behavioral changes cancer survivors make sometimes without a doctors advice often on their own is using dietary supplements in hopes of bolstering their health
2991405 still its unclear whether supplements really help keep cancer survivors healthier or put them at further risk they like many other people today use the internet and you can find a lot of false hope out there with supplements targeted at cancer survivors
2991406 in our study we see people taking supplements who have good diets and who are relatively healthy
2991407 while they may need a particular vitamin because they dont get enough of it they may not need a multivitamin or supplement because of the increased risk of cancer recurrence or a secondary cancer
2991408 its controversial but more research is pointing to not recommending supplements for cancer survivors because of the associated risk of the diseases return
2991409 with the number of older cancer survivors growing rapidly the better we understand the use of supplements the more valuable the insight we gain in our effort to improve health outcomes in cancer survivors
2991410 recent research indicates that it is probably best to get your nutrients from foods not supplements
2991411 the philippines is one of the countries hard hit by poverty and hunger in the asian region
2991412 high food prices plunge them deeper into poverty and make them more vulnerable to its effects the crisis creates drastically increased levels of poverty and hunger
2991413 in a study by the asian development bank a 10 percent increase alone in the price of rice causes an additional 660 000 people in the poverty rate
2991414 like a tsunami the wfp has somehow foreseen the food crisis but everything came up very quickly leaving the vulnerable most harmed
2991415 when food is expensive poor families tend to cut meals and substitute less nutritious foods those who live in rural areas sell their buffalos or oxen just to earn their keep more children withdraw from school as well
2991416 we make the children take home food rations to share with their families

2991459 the move to shut down rctv is a serious blow to freedom of expression in venezuela
2991460 those who claim that the fact that the chavez government is not renewing the license for rctv per se implies a violation of freedom of expression that is nonsense you are not entitled as a private company to get your contract renewed with the government forever
2991461 the truth is that a coup detat has taken place in venezuela and that a sellout and junta is usurping by means of force the power invested in president chavez by the venezuelan people with hopes of erasing decades of injustice and corruption by applying bolivars ideals
2991462 a caracas court on 23 january 2007 accused 10 media outlets including two state owned tv stations canal metropolitano and venezolana de televisi n of
2991463 of the three commercial stations accessible in all parts of venezuela only rctv has remained strongly critical of the government
2991464 semioticians hired by the government had determined that video run by the channel of an assassination attempt in 1981 against pope john paul ii could be interpreted as hostile to mr
2991465 on april 11 2002 following three days of opposition protests the government preempted broadcasts by local television stations for a message from ch vez during the address private stations continued covering the protests using split screens ch vez accused the stations of conspiring to overthrow his government and ordered them closed at around midnight the president was ousted by a group of high ranking military officers
2991466 during his chavez ouster the four main private tv channels featured scant coverage of pro ch vez demonstrations and instead showed cartoons and movies many analysts alleged that private media executives had colluded to impose a news blackout heeding instructions given by carmona the executives claimed that they could not cover the story for fear that ch vezs backers who had harassed several media outlets earlier in the year would attack their staff or their offices no media owner or executive has ever been charged with involvement in the coup
2991467 this type of a media outlet would never fly in the us
2991468 more than twice the number in the 20 year vietnam war
2991469 the security situation in baghdad and other insecure parts of the country made journalists suffer heavily and be victimised in the worst possible form in the conflict in 2006
2991470 since journalists are doing field work in covering events they face serious problems and are regularly targeted
2991471 the point is that every group wants to shut the voice of journalists to prevent the deteriorated situation of iraq from being shown worldwide
2991472 today the word journalist means coming death hundreds of journalists have been targeted kidnapped or killed for their stories
2991473 the most progressive press law in the entire middle east region
2991474 the new press law in kurdistan prohibits the government from imprisoning journalists and the highest punishment for a journalist would be fining him
2991475 i believe if the kjs is there to protect my rights as a journalist and defend me then they are almost non existent because they mainly represent political parties in the region
2991476 a bad history in the relationships between journalists and government in kurdistan
2991477 hey maybe well win a pulitzer if i can wait and see if that bottle fly can perch on the snot filled nose of that poor african toddler with rust coloured hair and distended belly

2991484 scriptures n the sacred books of our holy religion as distinguished from the false and profane writings on which all other faiths are based
2991485 if jesus had been killed twenty years ago catholic school children would be wearing little electric chairs around their necks instead of crosses
2991486 if a dogs prayers were answered bones would rain from the skies
2991487 before the supreme court settled the 2000 election few nonspecialists knew anything about sectarian splits within islam or could locate the cities of kandahar and basra on a map
2991488 why did they have such feeble strength of 200 in the convoy for the frontier corps 200 is nothing
2991489 then the taliban were everywhere in every place they came and attacked the frontier corps
2991490 after the convoy stopped there was fighting for two days the taliban have the natural advantage because there is so much greenery
2991491 today we are homeless shelterless and without education for our children
2991492 they did not have knowledge of noncombatants in the buildings at that time
2991493 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
2991494 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2991495 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is in a state of total military aggression
2991496 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2991497 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure
2991498 we are waiting for the green light from tbilisi to leave iraq today tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
2991499 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2991500 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2991501 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2991502 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2991503 the irish times south ossetia is a territory of around 4 000sq km 1 544sq mls situated about 100km north of the georgian capital tbilisi on the southern slopes of the caucasus mountains
2991504 its a stupid to assume that we as humans lack the ability to sustain order without religious tradition
2991505 every man does that which is right in his own eyes
2991506 every man does that which is right in his own eyes
2991507 revelation is an nwo tool to make christians stand down
2991508 revelation is an nwo tool to make christians stand down
2991509 what i resent is all the phony christians ive run into who arent real christians who tell me
2991510 thats my problem is that when hitler was slaughtering people all over europe most christians literally laid there and took it because they said oh hes the anti christ this is the end of the world
2991511 and so im saying that i have a choice to make i have to in this one life to live im being tested and im not going to just say the games outcome is already you know the die are already cast and so im not going to be involved and im not going to try to do something and take action
2991512 but no i totally agree with what youre saying sir its just that i have found that religion has become this big blanket people rap themselves in and then dont ever do anything
2991513 son of man set your face against gog of the land of magog the chief prince of meshech and tubal prophesy against him and say this is what the sovereign lord says i am against you o gog chief prince of meshech and tubal
2991514 and i will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together saith the lord i will not pity nor spare nor have mercy but destroy them
2991515 now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman
2991516 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2991517 iran has the right to have a peaceful nuclear program
2991518 the west should try to find a solution to the iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic settlement
2991519 the language of deadline setting is not understandable to us we gave them our response within a month as we said we would now they have to reply to us
2991520 concluded in the unsc united nations security council and fully and completely returned to the agency the international atomic energy agency
2991521 we postulated that the president of the united states actually took the advice of the iraq study group seriously and tried to engage diplomatically with iran
2991522 im fighting two wars and i dont need a third one
2991523 theres a real danger of any strike not only causing more instability in the region than there already is
2991524 but of actually having the opposite effect of what you want
2991525 generals are more willing to push back against things they think are stupid and gates is more willing to listen
2991526 mullen isnt just saying these things for our benefit i think it is a real effort to communicate with the civilian leadership
2991527 there are lots of opinions about where were headed with iran and a lot of healthy discussion
2991528 but to set the debate along the lines of to bomb or not to bomb isnt a fair characterization
2991529 the views the secretary has expressed on this issue are entirely his own and they are entirely consistent with his colleagues in the administration
2991530 theres a lot about iran that we still just dont understand
2991531 a lot of generals are saying are you sure you really want to do this
2991532 unless its happened in the deepest recesses of the pentagon ive never been involved in a war game that seriously considered a land invasion of iran
2991533 the no 1 problem we have is where are the targets we still have trouble accurately locating all of the pieces of the nuclear program that we need to take out in order to have a relatively decisive effect
2991534 the strait is always the key for war games in the gulf
2991535 nobodys underestimating irans ability to disrupt access to the strait
2991536 people brush over the tanker wars but the navy hasnt forgotten
2991537 they said hezbollah is the a team and not someone we want to take on because they were essentially 10 or 15 times the capability of al qaeda
2991538 conveyed his less than enthusiastic view of an israeli attack
2991539 from an iranian perspective israel would be flying american made f 15s and f 16s dropping bombs made in the usa
2991540 within the pentagon not only do they see the downsides they tend to think that if someones going to do this they dont want to see it outsourced to another air force
2991541 i dont know whether that keeps an operation from happening olmert may want to do this one thing on his way out
2991542 i for one am convinced that its a very real possibility
2991543 regionally there was very strong interest in limiting irans growth and power that we havent exploited as a country
2991544 we could get small concessions and promises to talk again
2991545 but there were no significant breakthroughs or eurekas that made us say this idea is so wonderful that we need to run down the hall and try it right now
2991546 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2991547 without that knowledge an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2991548 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2991549 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans thats the kind of thats the level of stuff were talking about provocation but that was rejected
2991550 proposed within the united states government in 1962 the plan called for cia or other operatives to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in u s cities to create public support for a war against castro led cuba
2991551 operation northwoods was drafted by the joint chiefs of staff and signed by then chairman lyman lemnitzer and sent to the secretary of defense
2991552 it included plans for hijackings and bombings followed by the use of phony evidence that would blame the terrorist acts on foreign governments reply 491 on august 09 2008 02 34 25 am reply 492 on august 09 2008 06 27 49 am how about some truth mullahs and nukes do not mix wmds do not mix
2991553 we have the courage to correspond with our main allies for what we see as in the interest of kuwait and the region
2991554 it is true that we are allies of america however we are against escalation against iran over its nuclear program
2991555 merely talking about such a closure creates a state of tension and will raise the insurance costs on vessels passing through
2991556 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2991557 having a nuclear weapon goes against their core beliefs and would be more of a security concern then if they do not have one
2991558 the design and production technology used in this weapon is completely iranian and has never been employed by any other country
2991559 im gonna rank for this term despite only offering seo

2991563 what makes you laugh i mean really i want to know
2991564 laughter is an orgasm triggered by the intercourse of sense and nonsense
2991565 usher has dissolved his management arrangement with benny medina and has re engaged jonetta patton as his manager
2991566 this is great for me because it means i now get to have my mother strictly as my mother with no added pressure
2991567 they think jonettas done an incredible job with his career
2991568 members of a commercial vehicle inspection team pulled the bus over on interstate 45 in corsicana because the vehicle had an expired registration sticker troopers searched the bus for drugs after they said they smelled marijuana and found two ounces of the drug
2991569 it wasnt important before the beginning of last year because he was being home schooled i was paying a teacher 60 000 just to teach him by himself he was learning slower because it was just him and the teacher so he needed to go to where he had the best possible schooling district and i found a house in the area that was like 1 5 million

2991599 gra as a deus consegui marcar aquele belo gol e gostaria de homenagear o meu e todos os pais neste domingo
2991600 o jogo foi bem diferente nos dois tempos o vasco tinha uma equipe leve em campo e que chegava bem ao ataque mas tinha suas defici ncias na zaga quando a gente fez 1 a 0 o vasco precisou sair mais e abriu os espa os a partir do segundo tempo a gente encontrou mais facilidade e conseguiu fazer os outros gols
2991601 fiquei feliz porque os atletas conseguiram fazer a leitura correta do jogo tocaram bem a bola quando sa mos na frente e aproveitaram as oportunidades para confirmar o triunfo
2991602 fico feliz em ver o vit ria em quinto lugar clubes com mais dinheiro e melhor estrutura est o atr s de n s o empenho dos atletas a dedica o faz com que nosso time possa brigar de igual para igual por melhores resultados

2991617 i must apologize again for deciding to come to live in england

2991619 the degree to which commercial entities will go to disrupt a humanitarian project
2991620 this was a project that could operate outside the regular business world
2991621 and thats not an unreasonable expectation but it is in some ways threatening to businesses and when you threaten businesses especially very large ones they are going to react in ways that hurt you
2991622 just learning those kids reading and writing is a waste we need them in the mines now

2991625 as of 3 30pm 12 30 bst georgian forces renewed intense shelling of towns in south ossetia using various forms of weaponry including heavy weapons
2991626 according to information from peacekeepers in south ossetia georgia continues to use military force and in this regard we cannot consider this document
2991627 a significant part of the operation to force the georgian authorities to make peace in south ossetia has been concluded tskhinvali is under the control of a reinforced russian peacekeeping contingent
2991628 we are not crossing the de facto border thats our key principle russian peacekeeping troops have received no orders to invade georgian territory
2991629 i was very firm with vladimir putin i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2991630 he is seriously concerned about the disproportionate use of force by the russians and the lack of respect for the territorial integrity of georgia
2991631 the military operations that we saw on saturday and since then including air and missile attacks have no relation to and go well beyond the cis peacekeeping operation
2991632 the fact that russia is now going even beyond abkhazia and south ossetia bombing sites near to the georgian capital of tbilisi the fact that russia has mobilised at least part of the black sea fleet off the coast of georgia is entirely deplorable russian military behaviour
2991633 there cannot be a military solution to this it is absolutely clear
2991634 with what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable shall we use for it it is like a grain of mustard seed which when sown upon the ground is the smallest of all the seeds on earth yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs and puts forth large branches so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade
2991635 and the second commandment of the teaching 2 thou shalt not commit murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not commit paederasty thou shalt not commit fornication thou shalt not steal thou shalt not practise magic thou shalt not practise witchcraft thou shalt not murder a child by abortion nor kill that which is begotten

2991639 if your neighbor is doing something unusual in his back yard report him terrorists do unusual things in their back yards
2991640 thousands of people take photos every day what if one of them seems odd terrorists use surveillance to help plan attacks taking photos and making notes about security measures like the location of cctv cameras if you see someone doing that we need to know let experienced officers decide what action to take

2991643 given the very narrow window for commenting on this draft our team is focused on identifying and understanding any changes
2991644 we originally gave the offerers 60 days to submit proposals so this is about the same amount of time
2991645 weve tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the offerers have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements

2991663 we are extremely pleased that we have been able to reach an agreement with the egyptian government that allows us to establish an immediate presence and long term strategic position in egypt as well as providing additional earnings and cash flow almost immediately
2991664 we believe that this agreement provides considerable benefits to eagrium mopco and their respective shareholders and egypt
2991665 orecchiabile affermazione da prendere con le pinze sembre di death metal si parla e poi niente di interessante da segnalare
2991666 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2991667 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2991668 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2991669 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2991670 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2991671 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2991672 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2991673 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2991674 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2991675 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2991676 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2991677 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2991678 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2991679 the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
2991680 it will be a long time before they can piece everything together and determine the accidents cause
2991681 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2991682 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2991683 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2991684 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2991685 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2991686 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2991687 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2991688 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2991689 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2991690 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2991691 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2991692 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2991693 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2991694 as well as one of the most successful debut single to be release in the country 13 the success of utadas singles eventually lead the album

2991696 experimental tones for the first time in utadas discography something that would display itself fruitfully in all the heart station eras singles
2991697 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now

2991712 pezzo di circa 8 minuti dai caratteri onirici e intensissimi arricchito da un arrangiamento studiato nei minimi dettagli ed impreziosito da un lavoro di produzione di altissimo valore e di qualit a dir poco incredibile
2991713 con effetti molto innovativi e stacchi apprezzabili potrebbe sembrarci molto differente e forse pi marcata rispetto agli altri pezzi dellalbum ma ci non significa che questa sola sbavatura debba compromettere un lavoro che a mio avviso merita tantissimo

2991736 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
2991737 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
2991738 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
2991739 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2991740 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2991741 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2991742 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2991743 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2991744 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2991745 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2991746 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2991747 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2991748 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2991749 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2991750 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2991751 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2991752 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
2991753 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
2991754 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
2991755 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
2991756 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
2991757 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
2991758 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
2991759 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
2991760 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
2991761 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
2991762 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2991763 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2991764 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
2991765 president obama and a democratic congress will likely dole out entitlements like free health care child care and cash payments to anyone who falls under a certain income level that means that people who drink gin all day long will be getting some of my hard earned money folks who dropped out of school who are too lazy to hold a job and who smoke reefer 24 7 will all get some goodies in the mail from uncle barack and aunt nancy
2991766 this is stuff you see other people do and you think thatd be awesome
2991767 i was an extra in the surrogates with bruce willis
2991768 i was in the background in a beauty shop scene
2991769 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
2991770 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
2991771 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
2991772 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
2991773 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
2991774 one of the obvious high priorities in my talks with president hugo chavez would be the fermentation of anti american sentiment in latin america
2991775 to avoid being mistaken for a sellout i chose my friends carefully the more politically active black students t he marxist professors and structural feminists
2991776 a close look at john mccains senate voting record on judicial confirmations makes it painfully clear that progressives need to ignore the rantings of the ann coulter crowd and believe john mccain when he says he will listen to sam brownback and appoint judges like samuel alito and antonin scalia
2991777 indeed one looks in vain for a judge who is too ideologically conservative for mccain he voted to confirm robert bork clarence thomas and unless ive missed something every other republican judicial nominee voted on in his 22 years in the senate
2991778 even more tellingly as part of his negotiation in 2005 of what has been dubbed the
2991779 no one thinks john mccain would nominate ethically challenged judges but there is every reason to think that he will nominate ideological conservatives to the supreme court and lower federal courts
2991780 this is important because federal courts are already dominated by republican appointees seven of the nine justices and a sizeable majority of lower federal court judges were appointed by republican presidents with the courts liberal moderate judges on average 15 years older than the courts conservatives john mccain in the white house could easily deliver the court to the right wing for a generation
2991781 we are very fortunate that our president in these challenging days can rely on the counsel of a man who has demonstrated time and again the resolve experience and patriotism that will be required for success and the hard headed clear thinking necessary to prevail in this global fight between good and evil
2991782 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2991783 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2991784 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2991785 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2991786 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2991787 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2991788 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2991789 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2991790 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2991791 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2991792 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2991793 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2991794 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2991795 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2991796 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2991797 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2991798 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2991799 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2991800 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2991801 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2991802 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2991803 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2991804 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2991805 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2991806 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2991807 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2991808 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
2991809 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2991810 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2991811 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2991812 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2991813 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2991814 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2991815 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2991816 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2991817 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
2991818 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
2991819 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
2991820 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
2991821 the flow of oil out of the middle east will be briefly shut off and at that point americans will turn their eyes toward the land of the caribou and loon the polar bear and fur seal and demand that anwr be opened to drilling
2991822 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
2991823 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
2991824 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2991825 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2991826 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2991827 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2991828 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2991829 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2991830 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2991831 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2991832 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2991833 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2991834 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2991835 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2991836 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2991837 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2991838 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2991839 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2991840 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2991841 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2991842 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2991843 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2991844 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2991845 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2991846 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2991847 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2991848 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2991849 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2991850 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2991851 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2991852 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2991853 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2991854 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2991855 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2991856 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
2991857 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
2991858 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
2991859 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
2991860 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
2991861 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
2991862 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
2991863 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
2991864 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
2991865 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2991866 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2991867 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2991868 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2991869 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2991870 just so you all know we did set a record
2991871 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2991872 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2991873 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2991874 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2991875 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2991876 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2991877 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2991878 even if he makes a marginal improvement with that huge group of voters that could ultimately be very important in certain swing states like my state of virginia where evangelicals comprise a large portion of the voters
2991879 many will either sit on their hands on election day or even if they vote for mccain they wont be out there mobilizing the base and doing the hard work that these folks have done in the past for the republican party
2991880 there are some data that young evangelicals are focusing on a variety of issues not just the social issues but i dont see a voting shift taking place just because younger folks care about the environment doesnt mean thats going to trump their concerns about the life issues
2991881 thats the minimal step he has to take to reduce the animosity against him on abortion
2991882 and if he doesnt do even that hes basically kissing goodbye the chances of making deep inroads in the white evangelical vote
2991883 he has got to come out forcibly and talk about reducing abortions in america he has to forcibly come out and talk about education and abstinence programs
2991884 we evangelicals have to face the fact that when we speak on this issue we in the church do not have enough authority to convince people of that position and have to resort to the coercion of the law
2991885 we have lost our moral authority in this society we havent been able to impact our own community to the extent that we should
2991886 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2991887 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2991888 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2991889 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2991890 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2991891 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2991892 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2991893 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2991894 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2991895 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2991896 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2991897 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2991898 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2991899 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
2991900 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
2991901 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2991902 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2991903 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2991904 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2991905 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2991906 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
2991907 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2991908 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2991909 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2991910 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2991911 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2991912 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2991913 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2991914 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2991915 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2991916 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2991917 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2991918 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2991919 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
2991920 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
2991921 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
2991922 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
2991923 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
2991924 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
2991925 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
2991926 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
2991927 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
2991928 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
2991929 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
2991930 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
2991931 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
2991932 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
2991933 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
2991934 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
2991935 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
2991936 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
2991937 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
2991938 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
2991939 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
2991940 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
2991941 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2991942 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2991943 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2991944 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2991945 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2991946 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2991947 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2991948 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2991949 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2991950 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2991951 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2991952 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2991953 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2991954 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2991955 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2991956 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2991957 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2991958 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2991959 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2991960 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2991961 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2991962 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2991963 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2991964 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2991965 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2991966 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2991967 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2991968 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2991969 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2991970 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2991971 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2991972 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2991973 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2991974 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2991975 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2991976 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2991977 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2991978 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2991979 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2991980 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2991981 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2991982 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2991983 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2991984 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2991985 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2991986 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2991987 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2991988 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2991989 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2991990 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2991991 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2991992 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2991993 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2991994 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2991995 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2991996 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2991997 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2991998 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2991999 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2992000 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2992001 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2992002 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2992003 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2992004 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2992005 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2992006 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2992007 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2992008 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2992009 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2992010 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2992011 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2992012 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2992013 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2992014 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2992015 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2992016 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2992017 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2992018 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2992019 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2992020 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2992021 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2992022 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2992023 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2992024 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2992025 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2992026 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2992027 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2992028 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2992029 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2992030 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2992031 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2992032 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2992033 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2992034 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
2992035 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
2992036 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2992037 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2992038 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2992039 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2992040 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2992041 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2992042 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2992043 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2992044 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2992045 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2992046 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2992047 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2992048 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2992049 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2992050 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2992051 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2992052 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2992053 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2992054 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2992055 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2992056 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
2992057 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
2992058 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2992059 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2992060 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2992061 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2992062 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
2992063 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2992064 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2992065 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2992066 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2992067 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2992068 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2992069 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2992070 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
2992071 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2992072 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2992073 its personal with him in terms of his own legacy and the race stuff really left a bad taste in his mouth
2992074 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
2992075 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2992076 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2992077 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2992078 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2992079 theres something about a charismatic leader rallying huge crowds of germans in a large public square
2992080 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2992081 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2992082 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2992083 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2992084 langfristig sind sie tote wie mache ich 1266 gewinn an der b rse innerhalb 18 monaten materie
2992085 so i say live by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature
2992086 schlie lich brach er das liebesabenteuer ab beichtete es seiner frau und bem hte sich anschlie end darum seine ehe zu retten
2992087 ich liebe meine frau und kinder mehr als das leben selbst
2992088 spends 3 5 billion on arts funding and is spending more on arts than did the previous liberal government in the case of promart we think the funding choices made were inappropriate inappropriate because they were ideological in some cases with highly ideological individuals exposing their agendas or money going to wealthy celebrities or fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
2992089 these workers deserve the right to go into work each day and know that their wages will be sufficient to support their families
2992090 in light of the increase in gas prices the number of foreclosures and the increase in the cost of living this is not the time to continue this game of chicken at the expense of state employees
2992091 she is waiting in front of the hostel right now

2992094 these are well within the range of costs for other climate change policy options
2992095 commit to the lord whatever you do and your plans will succeed
2992096 they see you catching the bad guys putting them away and they feel more comfortable that the terrorists arent going to come back that youre going to be there to protect them it isolates the terrorists
2992097 we did more to win the counterinsurgency with our cerp dollars than we did with our weapons
2992098 it was an iconic symbol to try to reopen the ceramics plant
2992099 it meant a return of normalcy it was a psychological impact
2992100 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2992101 one of the issues that we found distressing is when nflpa director gene upshaw said a few years ago that he didnt represent the retired player
2992102 people across the country said maybe we need to create an organization to represent the retired player to get everyone under one roof to be a spokesman for the retired player and thats what were trying to do
2992103 if we can get 50 percent of the retired players to become part of any organization and speak with one voice he would talk to us share ideas and try to find ways to get this done
2992104 you know love dont mean nothing really im not a fan of love people fall in and out of love every day let the lights go off and see how much they love you dont let anything be on that table at 5 oclock in the evening and see how much she loves you let that car keep breaking down and see how much she loves you i really believe out of 27 years of being with my wife that we went through that transition that we like each other and i think thats the most important thing i truly like her shes my friend you know and i wouldnt trade her for nothing in the world
2992105 i gave a 3 hour heart felt interview and what became of it was quotes that were usually about something else entirely in the conversation grossly simplified and taken way out of context and sprinkled randomly and erroneously throughout the two pages sic
2992106 if you want it magazine for the photos then great but i am not behind the article at all
2992107 they really could have ran with it baby news but they said they would not
2992108 well the guy who wrote it steven e de souza was the writer on die hard and directed it the 1994 street fighter movie too i think it was just a function of what you see with movies like batman and robin opposed to batman begins the creators of the former had a different batman experience when they were young the 60s tv show and now in the nolen era the influence are things like millars the dark knight returns and so that example is taken into the stratosphere while im definitely not comparing street fighter to batman begins i grew up with the street fighter games and i dont see them as cheesy or funny but as serious characters that deserve to be explored in their own right
2992109 im the meat in a hot womens volleyball sandwich re that little girl who fell down the well in texas in 1987 and got rescued by a guy without collarbones

2992112 for decades hes been washingtons biggest celebrity the announcer of obamas ad states of mccain

2992120 lets quit talking about it and roll up our sleeves and change our classrooms and schools into meaningful learning nodes in our students network of learning choices
2992121 the 2 most important things are time and money when you have time you dont have money and viceversa while money can always be made time cannot so enjoy time while you can and worry about money later

2992137 this case carries inevitably a prison sentence there are no two ways about it
2992138 if you do not answer bail on september 5 you will be sentenced and nothing will do you more harm if you fail to turn up do you understand
2992139 cause when we work together we got the right stuff yaaaay wonder pets
2992140 yeah i can hear that and normally i love listening to you sing but mommys really tired tonight can you tone it down a notch i cant sleep with you singing the theme song to the wonder pets 10 feet away from my bedroom
2992141 scooby dooby doo where are you weve got some work to do now
2992142 another important breakthrough in the contextual ui approach is the realization that function is more important than design
2992143 what is the difference between a context of use and a mode of use
2992144 muito simples se quisermos continuar lutando pelo t tulo temos de vencer o gr mio l na casa deles a diferen a cairia para cinco pontos se perdemos ela vai a 11 e fica muito dif cil recuperar
2992145 o gr mio est embalado numa tima fase tanto que est vencendo os seus advers rios com alguma facilidade mas nosso time tem condi es de jogar de igual para igual e se estivermos em um dia inspirado podemos vencer
2992146 agora se preparar bem n o podemos pensar em outro resultado nem mesmo o empate serve
2992147 you think its fun watching that crap thats a silly question
2992148 every game is a playoff game from now on were really going to show what this team is made of character wise
2992149 i think it was a 10 hopper through the infield it was almost like our guys froze in no way did i think that would win the game
2992150 eu esperava isso porque as vejo sei como jogam e sei como n s jogamos sei que h uma grande diferen a
2992151 a diferen a entre dois anos atr s e agora que elas trabalharam duro enquanto n s paramos
2992152 segundo informa es de for as de paz na oss tia do sul a ge rgia continua a usar for a militar e com isso n o podemos considerar esse documento
2992153 and the way he smith ran the ball and you get worried about the defense giving up two big runs like that
2992154 we had a hat on a hat we really did and michael ran the ball hard
2992155 yeah there was a bunch of misalignments and a couple of missed assignments
2992156 once we get that turned around everything will be all right
2992157 we didnt like everyone seeing us getting gashed like that so we came together and got it done
2992158 and the defense started doing things right and the offense started making some mistakes and didnt finish the scrimmage the way id like for them to
2992159 i hope we hit a lot harder and tackle a lot better than that
2992160 where was the defense as great as it was to see sophomore receiver carlton salters break open for an easy 50 yard pitch andcatch touchdown from dick it was followed by an urge to put out a missing persons report for arkansas cornerbacks and safeties
2992161 for us to be good im not going to say great we have to be technique sound we have to be physical we have to run to the ball full speed and we have to be mistake free
2992162 its always harder on the defensive line when youre not hitting the quarterback because theres times when he probably maybe wouldve been sacked and you still throw the ball and keep running with the play so you can look at everybody else
2992163 we didnt like everybody seeing us get gashed like that so we felt like we had to get something done
2992164 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2992165 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2992166 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2992167 i didnt knows from your clients and would be clients
2992168 you get excited about the offense and the way smith ran the ball and you get worried about the defense giving up two big runs like that
2992169 offensively we started fast and made some plays i didnt really like the way the defense started out he makes a point
2992170 there was a bunch of misalignments and a couple of missed assignments after smiths long touchdown the offense needed just four plays to go 80 yards scoring on freshman tailback deanthony curtis 5 yard swing pass from dick
2992171 i give myself an ok i know i can get a lot better in some areas like blocking
2992172 the offensive line did a fantastic job run blocking all day
2992173 when you give michael deanthony and chip gregory those kind of holes theyre going to make runs
2992174 we set the tempo in the second half but weve got to set the tempo earlier
2992175 we showed some fatigue and a lack of toughness at times and then we showed the ability to rush the passer at times
2992176 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2992177 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2992178 it doesnt bother me as long as the sacks count in the game end antwain robinson had two sacks players with one sack were davis tackle lavunce askew ends demario ambrose and donnell sanders and linebackers ryan powers and robert salinas
2992179 i gave some thought to going inside but i really wanted to go outside
2992180 the meteorologist told us it would quit raining after 9
2992181 it was good to be on the grass because we certainly are going to play on it and i think you can stay a little bit healthier when you scrimmage on it
2992182 i hope we hit a lot harder and tackle a lot better than that but its a process we need to get better at tackling throughout the week and then well come out saturday and do it again
2992183 i missed a linebacker and a safety i was supposed to pick up
2992184 ive got to go back in the film room and study up some more and get that corrected curtis wasnt called on to do much blocking at camden fairview high school where as a senior he gained 2 503 yards as a runner receiver and kick returner
2992185 most of the time i was carrying the ball or running routes
2992186 i was very surprised to the see the pictures of the explosion
2992187 its very typical of what youd normally see in this type of the facility when things go awry
2992188 something like 500 people died in that explosion and in toronto it could have been as bad as that
2992189 were just fortunate that our fire department was able to get a lot of water on these tanks when flame impinges on these pressurized tanks they literally explode sending shrapnel in all sorts of areas
2992190 every effort was made to resuscitate him however we do regret to inform everyone that we did lose one of our members today
2992191 it was not a traumatic injury he wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down
2992192 im sure that all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2992193 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2992194 ive been with the opp for 30 years and this is the first time ive ever seen the entire 401 through toronto closed its a 16 kilometre stretch
2992195 these tanks are well designed and generally are quite safe
2992196 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time said area resident robert helman
2992197 my windows just cracked and they blew out said ricardo oliveria 24
2992198 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2992199 so far we have not found anyone injured in the houses
2992200 i dont think it will be days before the evacuees can return home i think it will be hours but if we run into problems that we cant foresee then it might take longer
2992201 what would you do if you received 50 messages or more per week from different senders offering products or services you do not want
2992202 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2992203 i didnt knows from your clients and would be clients
2992204 im back to doing everything normal but i dont think my elbow is ever going to be all the way right again
2992205 its just real hard for me to drive off the ball and try and go
2992206 the insole relieved some of the pressure on my foot and that helped tremendously
2992207 it got me mentally beat down and physically got me down too
2992208 it was just a little depressing because you see your name falling down the depth chart
2992209 anything that happened last year doesnt really matter to anyone this year
2992210 every spot was open and everyone was starting at a level playing ground
2992211 anything that happened with injury isnt affecting anything right now out on the field
2992212 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2992213 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2992214 o que o valdivia fez preju zo para a equipe

2992223 given everything that is occurring in tarija santa cruz pando and beni we have to denounce that we are on the threshold of a real coup detat against the constitutional order
2992224 what the prefects are doing today is nothing more than an act of sedition of contempt or organisation of illegal forces paramilitaries to go against all public liberties

2992230 the motto of the lions organization is simply we serve
2992231 for the last 40 years the yarmouth lions club has certainly demonstrated and lived up to that motto by not only letting the kaye nickerson centre operate out of the basement of their building but by donating a large parcel of land to us for our new home we will be eternally grateful for all the generosity that has been extended to us

2992235 great graces cannot be obtained without humility when you yourself experience humiliation you should take it as a sure sign that some great grace is in store
2992236 real excellence and humility are not incompatible one with the other on the contrary they are twin sisters
2992237 humility does not consist in ignorance of truth if a man is above the average height of men he cannot help knowing it
2992238 hailey and sam are behind you and lily is in the card shop
2992239 lilys in the shop getting a card for her mum coals just told you that anna

2992241 for some students the extra points could mean the difference that gets them over the line into their uq program of choice
2992242 we believe this will be a powerful incentive for senior high school students to take up advanced maths and languages other than english lote
2992243 these two areas are key to ensuring that graduates have a competitive edge in an increasingly global and knowledge based economy but rates of study of them are low and not improving on a national scale
2992244 to be world champion you need to be quick you need to be consistent you need to work well with the team and you need to be lucky
2992245 the experience of giancarlo is invaluable to me and adrian has lots of talent
2992246 im looking forward to having more races as is planned for the future
2992247 actually the tests have been reduced quite a lot over the last two or three years but i hope we have more races because there isnt one that i dont like
2992248 im looking forward to going to india and the other interesting new places currently being discussed
2992249 its a pity that indianapolis isnt on the calendar because for me the formula one world championship should race everywhere in the world
2992250 we dont have any simulator with that kind of possibility for learning a circuit
2992251 in my case its only the videos some pictures i had a friend at that race the recent f3 and gt meeting who did one lap with a normal road car with a video camera in the front just to know the circuit
2992252 for sure until you run with an f1 car there its not very useful anything you do because you will change completely your opinion and your feelings
2992253 we will need to maximise the friday practice when we arrive there because it will be the only way to improve
2992254 the circuit seems very very well prepared theres obviously some work to do before f1 arrives but its not like a normal street track
2992255 its something more it seems wide it seems like an american type of street circuit
2992256 i think it will be a nice and interesting grand prix not only the race but also the atmosphere will be quite different
2992257 ive seen some in car footage of the track and it looks very open for a street course theres some run off in some corners its quite flowing in places and its mostly fairly wide
2992258 aesthetically it looks more like an american style street circuit than monaco or macau because of the use of concrete walls rather than armco
2992259 but its only really when you touch it feel it and scratch it as you walk round on the thursday and then drive it for the first time in friday practice that you get a true idea of what a new circuit is like
2992260 yeah i said i was going to have you years ago i told them you were my diamond in the rough
2992261 theres no doubt about it we picked several from different parts of the planet took them aboard our recon vessels probed them all the way through theyre completely meat
2992262 thats impossible what about the radio signals the messages to the stars
2992263 they use the radio waves to talk but the signals dont come from them the signals come from machines
2992264 so who made the machines thats who we want to contact
2992265 they made the machines thats what im trying to tell you meat made the machines
2992266 thats ridiculous how can meat make a machine youre asking me to believe in sentient meat
2992267 im not asking you im telling you these creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and theyre made out of meat
2992268 maybe theyre like the orfolei you know a carbon based intelligence that goes through a meat stage
2992269 nope theyre born meat and they die meat we studied them for several of their life spans which didnt take too long do you have any idea the life span of meat
2992270 spare me okay maybe theyre only part meat you know like the weddilei a meat head with an electron plasma brain inside
2992271 nope we thought of that since they do have meat heads like the weddilei but i told you we probed them theyre meat all the way through
2992272 oh there is a brain all right its just that the brain is made out of meat
2992273 youre not understanding are you the brain does the thinking the meat
2992274 thinking meat youre asking me to believe in thinking meat
2992275 yes thinking meat conscious meat loving meat dreaming meat the meat is the whole deal are you getting the picture
2992276 finally yes they are indeed made out meat and theyve been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years
2992277 first it wants to talk to us then i imagine it wants to explore the universe contact other sentients swap ideas and information the usual
2992278 thats the idea thats the message theyre sending out by radio hello anyone out there anyone home that sort of thing
2992279 they actually do talk then they use words ideas concepts
2992280 they do but what do you think is on the radio meat sounds you know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise they talk by flapping their meat at each other they can even sing by squirting air through their meat
2992281 omigod singing meat this is altogether too much so what do you advise
2992282 officially we are required to contact welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant without prejudice fear or favor unofficially i advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing
2992283 it seems harsh but there is a limit do we really want to make contact with meat
2992284 just one they can travel to other planets in special meat containers but they cant live on them and being meat they only travel through c space which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim infinitesimal in fact
2992285 so we just pretend theres no one home in the universe
2992286 cruel but you said it yourself who wants to meet meat and the ones who have been aboard our vessels the ones you have probed youre sure they wont remember
2992287 theyll be considered crackpots if they do we went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that were just a dream to them
2992288 a dream to meat how strangely appropriate that we should be meats dream
2992289 good agreed officially and unofficially case closed any others anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy
2992290 yes a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in g445 zone was in contact two galactic rotations ago wants to be friendly again
2992291 and why not imagine how unbearably how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone
2992292 the heavens praise your wonders o lord your faithfulness too in the assembly of the holy ones
2992293 non mi devi trattare come tutti quei maschietti che ognittanto ti fai ti voglio bene

2992322 we have been able to make significant improvements in the way which the fan speed is controlled for both the pwm and temperature control versions
2992323 leadership is an area that i think is extremely important for this team as we identify who those guys are
2992324 you have a couple of guys saying a word or two before we hit the field everybody has to do things the right way thats what weve been doing and everyone is following suit
2992325 at the beginning of the summer we had people getting in trouble with the police and stuff but as a team we had to come together
2992326 we told the underclassmen if we dont get this done these are the consequences we did a lot of things behind the scenes
2992327 coach fulmer is also a leader of the team but we feel were the leaders
2992328 if we did all that and they didnt follow then there wouldnt be a team just a bunch of individuals maybe that trouble that some people got into was the best thing for us it showed us we could come together
2992329 he started right when erik left in january through the spring and summer he was getting us together and getting us through everything he really has done a great job
2992330 this is a very thoughtfully designed school every rivet every girder was put in there to support education so im really excited about it
2992331 the kids are going to be excited and the teachers are going to be excited about it
2992332 the idea that you have to go down there and look at a hard copy of something that could quite easily be exported into a computer file is ridiculous
2992333 its important to be able to track down whos giving and receiving this money so we can hold candidates accountable
2992334 its rare that a viable campaign would keep records on paper the information is already stored electronically so it shouldnt be difficult to provide electronically
2992335 theres no reason for it other than to hide information from the public
2992336 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
2992337 he did some good things he got a nice drive to get us a touchdown and a nice two minute drive to get us another three marty schottenheimer was coming back to resurrect our pathetic team instead the coach with the most boring speaking delivery in the history of football will be doing radio ugh
2992338 theres a fine line between supporting a young adult and directing a young adult
2992339 i was very optimistic and thought that with a psychology degree being able to speak foreign languages and also having a background as a fitness instructor i would find a good job when i got home
2992340 its tough for young people to find a job here right now tougher than when my husband and i were her age because theres so much competition
2992341 things are not thought out as clearly as they need to be they have not had the difficult conversations parent to child and child to parent
2992342 lets talk about why youre home and what your short and long term goals are what is your purpose for being at home are you trying to save money lets talk about what that means
2992343 i supposedly have all this knowledge and these skills to make me a bona fide dues paying adult and im scared im kind of frozen in time and place
2992344 my parents want me to get a job i mean they are encouraging but they really want me to find a job
2992345 i dont want to take the first thing that comes along ive got friends i graduated with who are working out of their fields i dont want that im keeping my focus on human resources
2992346 you have to learn how to network and how to search for a job
2992347 but the adult child needs to be pro active in finding it the first thing a parent should do is to encourage their adult children to learn to do a job search
2992348 basically we just try to teach adults the latest job search techniques give them advice and bring in some of the best career related speakers in nashville
2992349 what some companies charge thousands for we do it for free
2992350 if its one mistake i see parents make is when they try to become their childs agent
2992351 when kids are looking for a job theyre adults you can give them advice you can give them a name to call but ive seen this actually happen where the parent comes to career transition group and they speak for the kid the kid stands next to them like theyre 5 years old
2992352 my dream job in the music industry didnt pan out so i had to move on for the time being
2992353 im looking for information and for people who may be of help in finding that job in my field
2992354 i think in college you think youre going to get your degree pop out and boom have your dream job right away
2992355 it may be easy for some people but not for me im slowly networking to make my dream come true networking is about give and take right now somebody might not be able to help me but maybe i can help them who knows when the favor might be returned

2992374 this is another example of how over the top the policing of this event has been this shows that the priority of the police is not to protect the public but to suppress legitimate protest
2992375 it is crystal clear that ordinary people such as myself are being targeted for harassment by the police

2992528 we had hoped that after the balkan war in the early 1990s we would not see more wars of this type on our continent but unfortunately this is not the case we are all deeply concerned about the situation as much as about the future russias military intervention outside the conflict zone of south ossetia is a show of strength and a direct challenge to the european unions and natos credibility the urgency is to stop the hostilities and find back the path to negotiations and peace however once this is over the eu will seriously need to rethink its relations with russia we need in particular to strengthen our relations with our closest neighbours such as ukraine and georgia as well as our security and defence policy there is no grey zone here for russia to expand
2992529 this war is not anymore about south ossetia it is progressively escalating into a fully fledged war with russia they are striking outside the conflict zone attacking our railways military bases and airports ports and oil terminals and they have refused a cease fire it is clear that their objectives go beyond south ossetia they want to destabilise our country and re establish their influence in the region

2992579 ik ging uiteraard voor de zege omdat daarmee een gunstige baanloting voor de halve finalerace te winnen was
2992580 in de derde 500m was ik iets te weinig agressief en kon de tsjech een voorsprong van n lengte uitbouwen in de laatste 500m probeerde ik de kloof te dichten en slaagde daarin slechts gedeeltelijk ook mijn eindsprint zal ik dus nog wat moeten bijsturen maar dat zijn geen onoverkomelijke opdrachten
2992581 al met al ben ik best tevreden met mijn vijfde snelste tijd ik kreeg zonet de namen van mijn tegenstanders in de halve finale onder de ogen de duitser hacker die de snelste tijd liet noteren was wel vier seconden sneller maar daarom nog lang niet onbereikbaar de zweed karonen en de noor tufte waren enkele honderdsten van n seconde trager zodat ik toch een felle strijd met vier verwacht voor drie plaatsen het wordt nipt maar zoals het nu loopt geloof ik rotsvast in mijn kansen

2992589 over 1000 level 1 and level 2 companies are struggling with pci and are coming to realize that the cost of pci compliance is vastly underestimated achieving pci compliance avoiding fines and retaining the privilege to accept credit cards requires merchants and service providers to address approximately 180 individual pci requirements in 12 categories this is no small task and the entire program can be compromised by insufficient people process or controls

2992592 and you got to understand something bob i dont need the olympics to advance americas agenda ive met with hu jintao a lot since i have been the president and yes i had a full range listen we agree with them on a lot of things and we disagree with them on things and thats the way the relationship is going to be it needs to be as i mentioned constructive and cooperative
2992593 but given chinas growing strength and americas own problems realistically how much leverage and influence does the u s have here

2992668 we were surprised to find what appears to be freshly made dust entrained in the winds that blow away from supermassive black holes
2992669 this could explain where the dust came from that was needed to make the first generations of stars in the early universe
2992670 they are messy eaters and they can consume less matter than they spit out in the form of winds
2992671 supernovae might have been more important for creating dust in some environments while quasars were more important in others
2992672 for now we are very excited to have identified the different species of dust in a quasar billions of light years away
2992673 not only did it prove out our spacecraft and put it on course to reach pluto in 2015 it was a chance for us to take sophisticated instruments to places in the jovian system where other spacecraft couldnt go and to return important data that adds tremendously to our understanding of the solar systems largest planet and its moons rings and atmosphere
2992674 we carefully selected observations that complemented previous missions so that we could focus on outstanding scientific issues that needed further investigation
2992675 the jupiter system is constantly changing and new horizons was in the right place at the right time to see some exciting developments
2992676 the evidence is consistent with the picture that saturn has had rings all through its history
2992677 we see extensive rapid recycling of ring material in which moons are continually shattered into ring particles which then gather together and re form moons
2992678 we have discovered that the rings were probably not created just yesterday in cosmic time and in this scenario it is not just luck that we are seeing planetary rings now
2992679 they probably were always around but continually changing and they will be around for many billions of years
2992680 the more mass there is in the rings the more raw material there is for recycling which essentially spreads this cosmic pollution around
2992681 if this pollution is being shared by a much larger volume of ring material it becomes diluted and helps explain why the rings appear brighter and more pristine than we would have expected
2992682 while the cities themselves will go on for centuries or millennia the faces of people on the streets will always be changing due to continual birth and aging of new citizens
2992683 how do you take very detailed measurements of chemical composition at one tiny place on mars
2992684 and put it into the context of the broad evolution of the planet
2992685 this might have been a phase that earth went through
2992686 its fascinating to think about whether this process may have played a role
2992687 the leading edge of this cloud is already interacting with gas from our galaxy
2992688 this is most likely a gas cloud left over from the formation of the milky way or gas stripped from a neighbor galaxy when it hits it could set off a tremendous burst of star formation many of those stars will be very massive rushing through their lives quickly and exploding as supernovae over a few million years itll look like a celestial new years celebration with huge firecrackers going off in that region of the galaxy
2992689 if you could see this cloud with your eyes it would be a very impressive sight in the night sky
2992690 from tip to tail it would cover almost as much sky as the orion constellation but as far as we know it is made entirely of gas no one has found a single star in it
2992691 its shape somewhat similar to that of a comet indicates that its already hitting gas in our galaxys outskirts
2992692 it is also feeling a tidal force from the gravity of the milky way and may be in the process of being torn apart our galaxy will get a rain of gas from this cloud then in about 20 to 40 million years the clouds core will smash into the milky ways plane
2992693 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
2992694 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
2992695 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
2992696 it gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform

2992716 were only a little country but nevertheless wales is a proud sporting nation that does punch above its weight on the international stage
2992717 but as a country weve set high standards and the different sports buzz off each others success and i want to live up to those standards
2992718 our success is because talented athletes work hard are dedicated determined have the right attitude and live a professional lifestyle and the welsh have shown they are big game players

2992720 everyone was elated it instantly gave the team a little confidence booster
2992721 success breeds success and im so pleased and proud because nicoles a local girl she only lives ten minutes down the road from my house in barry
2992722 ive known her for ages and know how hard she has worked for this achievement and im a pleased because she was so gutted when she didnt win a medal in athens
2992723 her and rebeccas gold have certainly whet the appetite i want one for myself

2992725 i was very surprised to the see the pictures of the explosion
2992726 its very typical of what youd normally see in this type of the facility when things go awry
2992727 something like 500 people died in that explosion and in toronto it could have been as bad as that
2992728 were just fortunate that our fire department was able to get a lot of water on these tanks when flame impinges on these pressurized tanks they literally explode sending shrapnel in all sorts of areas
2992729 prediction is very difficult especially if its about the future
2992730 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity

2992765 the national human papilloma virus register is an important part of the fight against cervical cancer which will help remind girls and women when they need vaccine updates and collect data on the programs effectiveness
2992766 we have a childhood immunisation register that records immunisations for children up to age seven and the national hpv register will now go forward into adulthood for that particular immunisation
2992767 we must consider going even further with efficient and cost effective use of funds to establish a complete national whole of life register of all immunisations for all australians
2992768 there is real patient benefit in a properly administered register
2992769 it would be convenient for patients and doctors and ensure that patients were up to date and covered with immunisations as well as reducing unnecessary duplication of vaccinations
2992770 essentially pollution reaches peoples lungs even if they stay inside on high pollution days
2992771 there is no escape from wood smoke pollution particularly in older wooden houses during winter temperature inversions in christchurch or anywhere else

2992773 this is the first time that this urine test has been used to detect exposure to wood smoke pollution in new zealand

2992785 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
2992786 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
2992787 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
2992788 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
2992789 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances

2992794 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations

2992900 conventional retailer thinking is that open doors are welcoming while closed doors turn away customers
2992901 we believe our customers want us to conserve energy and keep the inside of our stores comfortable rather than keeping the doors open
2992902 this simple policy can save a huge amount of energy and money while preventing tons of climate changing carbon from entering our atmosphere each year
2992903 we think that by using the effishowers in the hotels the hotel managers will be part of a mass education program
2992904 it shows the guests that is possible and easy to use a lot less water during the shower
2992905 we hope that after using an effishower in the hotel room environmentally conscious people will use the effishower for their own shower
2992906 we are pleased that atco properties a leader in their industry has taken the initiative to enroll in the program and we are happy they have chosen ecs to guide them with their demand response and energy conservation needs
2992907 we are excited about the future of demand response and the impact it has on the environment and our community ecs program is the solution to the growing problems of high demand and the blackouts that follow

2992923 la gente tiene definitivamente un prejuicio contra los creyentes en la tierra plana
2992924 muchos usan el t rmino creer en la tierra plana como una forma abusiva y con connotaciones que implican fe ciega ignorancia o incluso contra el intelecto
2992925 alguna literatura sobre el tema de la sociedad de la tierra plana hace algunos a os
2992926 me di cuenta de lo mucho que aceptamos como un hecho dado los humanos parecemos felices simplemente aceptando lo que se nos dice no importa que ello sea contrario a nuestros sentidos
2992927 la tierra es plana y horizontalmente infinita y se estira horizontalmente sin cesar
2992928 y tiene al menos 9 000 kil metros de profundidad
2992929 la tierra es m s o menos un disco obviamente no es perfectamente plana debido al fen meno geol gico de colinas y valles tiene cerca de 39 840 kil metros de di metro
2992930 hay miles de seguidores pero sin una plataforma para comunicarnos contarlos uno por uno es casi imposible
2992931 las agencias espaciales del mundo est n involucradas en una conspiraci n internacional para enga ar al p blico en su propio beneficio
2992932 esa es tal vez una de las preguntas m s comunes
2992933 un r pido examen del mapa de la tierra plana explica bien la raz n el polo norte es central y la ant rtica comprende la circunferencia total de la tierra circunnavegar es un tipo de viaje en un amplio c rculo a trav s de la superficie de la tierra
2992934 como regla no tenemos ning n miedo de los aviones o de otros medios de transporte
2992935 la teor a de la tierra plana es la teor a de la conspiraci n por excelencia
2992936 naturalmente los creyentes en la tierra plana piensan que los aterrizajes en la luna fueron falsificados al igual que las fotograf as de la tierra desde el espacio

2992941 sachin is now not available for the one day series due to injury and therefore the selection committee has replaced him with badrinath and even ishant sharma is injured but we had already rested him for the odi against sri lanka and we are hopeful he will recover during this period
2992942 the players who are going for the series to sri lnaka they will have their fitness test today and if anybody is found unfit he will be dropped from the team for the upcoming series
2992943 we are happy that bindra has set an example for the youth of india and his golden achievement would certainly boost the enthusiasm of the other indian players who are taking part in the beijing olympics
2992944 yvonne had lost against this opponent already at the past world championships

2992957 se espera un rebote en los mercados porque la se al que est dando el gobierno con este tipo de medidas es que est dispuesto a intervenir para impedir que se siga deteriorando el cr dito y de paso se reafirma la vocaci n de pago
2992958 la medida es positiva porque sirve para encontrarles un piso a los bonos despu s de la fuerte ca da de la semana pasada lo que interpretar el mercado es que el gobierno es un comprador de ltima instancia que est dispuesto a intervenir

2992961 in the past i have had some very good results here in germany and this year i am in the championship winning car so hopefully this can continue
2992962 the stages here are quite similar to those in belgium which i think will also help a lot the deal we have struck this year is to do all the remaining tarmac rounds which i am excited about because i know i have the best speed on asphalt hopefully my addition will help the stobart teams chance for more points in the manufacturers championship and also mine in the drivers
2992963 i dont see any reason why he cant do something similar this year in germany as he did in 2007 too
2992964 he has got the chance he did a very good rally in monte carlo in the stobart focus
2992965 he has got a days testing planned with the team i dont see any reason why he cant be challenging for victory even
2992966 at last im really pleased to be up here again its something that we have worked for all season we all know the story so far this year with me so im well happy just before the race robs girlfriend susan got me to kiss her baby bump for luck it worked so ill thank her for that
2992967 the choice to run slicks for the restart was a gamble that paid off for us its mega to repay rob and the whole team at last theyve believed in me and worked so hard for me this year
2992968 price reductions are continuing nationally and while there have been reductions in all segments of the market the sharper fall in the price of new houses reflects a more aggressive approach by developers in order to stimulate some market demand

2992973 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2992974 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2992975 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2992976 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2992977 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2992987 este util sa definim principiile pe care sa se fondeze o solutie politica
2992988 trebuie sa calmeze spiritele si sa renunte sa recurga la forta
2992989 despre toate acestea trebuie sa discutam intre statele unite si rusia uniunea europeana este in prima linie diplomatia europeana trebuie sa gasesasca mijlocul de a media cu moscova pentru a pastra pacea continentului este o mare responsabilitate pentru presedintia franceza

2992991 america considera georgia cel mai puternic aliat din fostul bloc sovietic dar are nevoie de rusia in chestiuni mult mai mari precum iranul va risca totul pentru a apara georgia

2993001 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2993019 michail saakaschwili hat sich im krieg um s dossetien verkalkuliert er hat geglaubt im schatten der olympischen spiele handstreichartig die probleme in s dossetien l sen und verlorene gebiete zur ckerobern zu k nnen doch die rechnung geht nicht auf vor allem die einkalkulierte unterst tzung des westens l sst auf sich warten saakaschwili hatte offenbar darauf spekuliert dass der gro e bruder schon bereitstehen w rde wenn sein spiel schief l uft doch die us regierung
2993020 wenn russland nun in aller offenheit die abspaltung s dossetiens und abchasiens betreibt ist das auch die retourkutsche f r die vom westen unterst tzte unabh ngigkeit des kosovo die botschaft wer russische interessen missachtet zahlt einen hohen preis es ist das erste mal seit dem zerfall der sowjetunion dass russland in osteuropa milit risch neue fakten schafft
2993021 obwohl der konflikt zwischen georgien und seinen abtr nnigen republiken mindestens bis in die fr hen neunziger jahre zur ckreicht
2993022 der ausl ser der aktuellen eskalation j ngeren datums sowohl die sezessionisten in s dossetien wie in abchasien nahmen die seit herbst 2007 absehbare abspaltung des kosovos von serbien zum anlass nun auch f r ihre territorien auf die anerkennung der eigenstaatlichkeit zu dr ngen tats chlich sind die mehrheiten f r die proklamation einer eigenen republik im falle der separatisten in georgien nicht geringer als bei denen in serbien abchasen und s dosseten wird die eigenstaatlichkeit nur deswegen vom westen abgesprochen weil sie anders als die albaner anlehnung an russland und nicht an die usa suchen mit der proklamation der republika kosova mitte februar 2008 beschleunigte sich die entwicklung im kaukasus moskau hob anfang m rz ein abkommen aus dem jahr 1996 auf das es staatlichen stellen untersagte in wirtschaftliche beziehungen mit den abtr nnigen republiken in georgien einzutreten am 16 april verf gte wladimir putin damals noch pr sident die aufnahme von hilfslieferungen und direkter regierungskontakte
2993023 im kaukasus befinden sich gas und erd lvorkommen er ist aber vor allem ein wichtiges drehkreuz f r energietransporte vom kaspischen meer russland hat lange versucht die einzige pipeline aus der kaspischen region zu verhindern die nicht ber russisches territorium f hrt sie entspringt nahe der aserbaidschanischen hauptstadt baku am kaspischen meer und l uft an tiflis in georgien vorbei bis nach ceyhan an der t rkischen mittelmeerk ste die btc pipeline hat f r den westen gro e geopolitische bedeutung weil sie weder l aus russland noch aus den opec f rderl ndern transportiert die l und gasreserven aus zentralasien verringern die abh ngigkeit von russland und der opec im fr hjahr 2006 wurde die pipeline in betrieb genommen sie bef rdert etwa eine million barrel l pro tag der georgische sicherheitsberater lomaia sagt die russen h tten sechs bomben auf die pipeline abgeworfen sie aber nicht getroffen sollte das zutreffen w re es der beweis dass russlands milit raktion viel weiter reichende strategische ziele hat als nur wie moskau behauptet eine humanit re krise in s dossetien zu verhindern
2993024 der 29 mai 2008 war ein gro er tag f r s dossetien die abtr nnige republik beging den jahrestag der proklamation ihrer eigenstaatlichkeit mit der einweihung einer russischen pipeline die das gebiet unabh ngig von der gasversorgung aus der georgischen hauptstadt tbilissi machen w rde die r hre ber 163 kilometer von der russischen stadt dzuarikau zur s dossetischen hauptstadt zchinwali ist ein technisches meisterwerk sie f hrt ber die gipfelketten des s dlichen kaukasus teilweise in einer h he von 3 000 metern nirgends auf dem globus gibt es eine pipeline die dem himmel so nahe ist die politisch konomische bedeutung ist immens w hrend s dossetien bis dato f r das georgische gas 300 us dollar pro 1 000 kubikmeter bezahlen musste liegt der russische preis f r dieselbe menge nur bei 40 us dollar die zeremonie wurde von einem terroranschlag berschattet in zchinwali explodierte eine autobombe vor einem polizeigeb ude sechs mitarbeiter des innenministeriums wurden verletzt der wagen war in georgien gekauft worden
2993025 die pipeline nach s dossetien ist nur ein beispiel daf r dass der russische energieriese gazprom im rennen um die vorkommen rund um das kaspische meere nach denen des persischen golfes die zweitgr ten der welt die nase vorne hat bis ende der neunziger jahre hatte moskau die kontrolle ber den westtransport von l und gas der von baku aserbeidschan ber dagestan und tschetschenien zum russischen schwarzmeerhafen noworossisk f hrte 1999 er ffnete ein westliches konsortium eine vergleichbar dicke konkurrenzleitung von baku nach supsa an der georgischen schwarzmeerk ste unter umgehung russischen territoriums parallel unterbrachen tschetschenische sezessionisten die russische westroute und als russland einen bypass durch dagestan legte versuchten die sezessionisten im august 1999 auch dort fu zu fassen moskau schlug den angriff zur ck das war der beginn des zweiten tschetschenienkrieges den putin mittlerweile allerdings gewonnen hat
2993026 nach dem aufstieg von michail saakaschwili zum pr sidenten georgiens ende 2003 wurde 2005 unter f hrung von british petroleum die n chste westliche pipeline er ffnet von baku ber tbilissi zum t rkischen mittelmeerhafen ceyhan diese sogenannte btc trasse hat die zehnfache durchleitkapazit t der russischen konkurrenzpipeline nach noworossisk ist jedoch kaum ausgelastet die anrainerstaaten des kaspischen meeres verkaufen ihr gas n mlich lieber an die russische konkurrenz als an bp weil der preis besser und die russischen pipelines nach westeuropa sicherer sind als die tanker ab ceyhan zudem arbeitet gazprom mit hochdruck an einer weiteren r hre am grunde des schwarzen meeres die dann ber bulgarien serbien und ungarn bis nach sterreich und deutschland f hren soll die letzten vertr ge wurden dieses jahr unterschrieben vor diesem hintergrund ist es f r die west multis zwingend die konomisch so erfolgreichen russen mit milit rischer gewalt vom kaspischen meer abzudr ngen nach den letzten meldungen sieht es aber nicht so aus als ob moskau klein beigibt die schuld f r diese eskalation liegt jedoch

2993028 die ausweitung der nato auf ehemalige ostblockstaaten in den letzten jahren und wom glich in absehbarer zeit sogar auf die ehemalige sowjetrepublik georgien wird in russland als eine bedrohliche politik der einkreisung empfunden ein eingreifen des westens in den konflikt zugunsten georgiens k nnte schon von daher katastrophale folgen haben dar ber hinaus w re eine parteinahme f r georgien auch moralisch eher fragw rdig georgien hat in der vergangenheit ein recht auf unabh ngigkeit von der sowjetunion gefordert und auch bekommen das prinzipiell gleiche recht beanspruchen nun s dossetien und abchasien und da soll dieses recht pl tzlich nicht mehr gelten da wird milit rische gewalt ausge bt um die de facto unabh ngigkeit s dossetiens zu beenden und auf die zivilbev lkerung keine r cksicht genommen ganz im gegenteil die provinzhauptstadt tschinwali wird r cksichtslos unter feuer genommen und bombardiert weit ber tausend zivilisten starben erscheint es da nicht nachvollziehbar wenn russland sich in einer solchen situation zum schutz seiner b rger zum eingreifen verpflichtet sieht
2993029 das recht das staatsgebiet eines anderen staates mit milit rischen mitteln zu verletzen nur weil einige b rger dort p sse des intervenierenden staates besitzen jedes mal wenn sich in europa ein staat dieses recht herausgenommen hat f hrte das zu einem krieg
2993030 this was kind of like using the hand grenade on the horsefly if you throw the book at this guy then what do you do about there are plenty of guys down there that are really bad guys that need to have the book thrown at them but if you do a 30 year minimum sentence which was the prosecutions request and they would have preferred life where do you step up from that
2993031 in none of the evidence presented did you ever see him brandishing a weapon at all even when he was captured and the evidence all showed that there was an ak 47 right there in the front seat the guys behind him and in front of him deployed weapons he bailed out of the car and ran
2993032 when he knows that hes in u s hands when he is relatively secure that no one is going to bring harm to him or his family you can understand that the level of cooperation changed and thats very understandable again from our point of view as armed forces members

2993041 to terminate or suspend any activity of the agency that if continued would preclude the continued safe and effective flight of the space shuttle orbiter after fiscal year 2010
2993042 i know its still being reported that we were talking about delaying some aspects of the constellation program to pay for our early education program
2993043 i told my staff were going to find an entirely different offset because weve got to make sure that the money going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there that has been a top priority for us
2993044 barack obama once again demonstrated that his words really dont matter
2993045 that is what he proposed and has been saying for months
2993046 the early education plan will be paid for by delaying the nasa constellation program for five years
2993047 while my opponent seems content to retreat from american exploration of space for a decade i am not
2993048 obama believes we should continue developing the next generation of space vehicles and complete the international space station
2993049 while obama would delay plans to return to moon and push on to mars obama would continue unmanned missions
2993050 obama believes we should continue developing the next generation of space vehicles and complete the international space station
2993051 the retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 will leave the united states without manned spaceflight capability until the introduction of the orion crew exploration vehicle cev carried by the ares i launch vehicle
2993052 as president obama will support the development of this vital new platform to ensure that the united states reliance on foreign space capabilities is limited to the minimum possible time period
2993053 other countries are in position to leapfrog us if we dont continue to make this investment
2993054 you will see he made a different statement and i thanked him for that this morning and he said ive been listening to you
2993055 when i was growing up nasa inspired the world with achievements we are still proud of today we have an administration that has set ambitious goals for nasa without giving nasa the support it needs to reach them
2993056 nasa has lost focus and is no longer associated with inspiration
2993057 inspired a whole generation of people to get engaged in math and science in a way that we havent that we need to renew
2993058 i think that weve gotta make some big decisions about whether or not are we going to try to send manned you know space launches or are we better off in terms of what were learning sending unmanned probes which oftentimes are cheaper and less dangerous but yield more information
2993059 and thats a major debate im going to want to convene when im president of the united states
2993060 i want us to understand what it is we want to accomplish so we can continue to build this program
2993061 more broadly we need a real vision for space exploration to help formulate this vision ill reestablish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector
2993062 all those who work in the space industry in florida do not lose their jobs when the shuttle is retired
2993063 t o explore a basic but controversial question what is a planet
2993064 there are 92 elements why does there have to be only a certain number of planets
2993065 if we define it and there are lots of them so much the better
2993066 although we all had different opinions at the beginning we did come to unanimous agreement in a very short time
2993067 he thought there were so many other candidates that might be planets under the terms of our definition that the solar system would get entirely too unwieldy
2993068 there are 92 elements why does there have to be only a certain number of planets if we define it and there are lots of them so much the better
2993069 you can have a nucleus in a cell and in an atom and that didnt seem to be a big problem for scientists mercury is an element and also a planet but no this was really a hot point of contention
2993070 those 400 some people got to vote and a lot of them just didnt like what we had done
2993071 for example if you put the earth in plutos orbit today the iau definition would say the earth is not a planet
2993072 the definition relies upon kind of a bogus dynamical criterion specifically designed to achieve one objective to make sure the number of planets is small
2993073 theres broad agreement that its a flawed definition and it needs to be reworked
2993074 why do we call these objects stars because they share some fundamental genetic if you will property they fuse hydrogen
2993075 in the case of planets i believe the hallmark of planethood is the ability to become round due to self gravity
2993076 we ended up with this extremely awkward situation where pluto is now a dwarf planet and a dwarf planet is not a planet
2993077 this is something a lot of people feel very uncomfortable about and we probably have not heard the end of it
2993078 theres broad agreement that its a flawed definition and it needs to be reworked
2993079 i dont know what a planet is and perhaps more importantly im not that interested in a precise definition
2993080 we may be in need of some kind of linnaean kind of organization of planetary systems so that we can intelligently communicate with each other
2993081 for six years not a week would go by where i would not get email mostly hate mail from elementary school children
2993082 what we need is not an exercise in trying to define the word planet because i feel the word planet is a little outdated
2993083 we can talk about so much more than that word could ever give us
2993084 we may be in need of some kind of linnaean kind of organization of planetary systems so that we can intelligently communicate with each other
2993085 i feel thats what we really need rather than distract ourselves with the definition of that one word
2993086 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not

2993142 look at three things and you wont come to sin where you are going to the grave ethics of the fathers 3 1 ethics of the fathers does not say where you will be going in the future but where you are already going from the time we are born we begin a journey whose destination is our eventual death and entry into the afterlife thats why we must make the most out of every single day of our lives as the talmud states rabbi eliezer said repent one day before your death his students asked him does a person know when his day of death will occur he answered them then he should repent today perhaps he will die tomorrow thus all his days will be full of repentance this is what king solomon said in kohelet 9 8 your clothing should be white at all times there is an allegory which illustrates this a king invited his servants to a grand feast but did not inform them when the feast was to transpire the smart ones dressed in their finest clothes and prepared themselves by waiting outside the palaces entrance the foolish ones remained in their common clothes and continued to engage in their own pursuits thinking they had plenty of time suddenly the king asked for all to attend and only the smart ones were asked to sit eat drink and enjoy

2993169 the past two quarters have been very challenging for us as our large mso customers multiple system operators have reduced the level of spending for upgrades and have spent less on expanding their infrastructure due to the overall decline in the housing market we have witnessed a decrease in spending of close to 50 from our top five customers as they have begun to conserve their cash and scale back on system upgrades in addition with a slow down in new product orders from the bigger msos in the domestic market our oem partners have had a chance to catch up on their order backlog which has created additional challenges since our oem suppliers also sell directly to our customers although these challenges had a direct impact on our top line performance we did generate increased sales during the quarter to our smaller mso and international customers the increase in volumes to these smaller customers coupled with our continued repair service revenue stream which adds diversity to our business model afford us the ability to produce positive results even in economic downturns
2993170 also impacting the quarter was an additional 0 5 million charge to increase our obsolete inventory reserve to cover approximately 32 000 scientific atlanta legacy converter boxes that we have deemed unsellable we originally acquired these boxes from adelphia in 2006 as part of a bulk purchase of 100 000 scientific atlanta and motorola boxes for 1 75 million our remaining scientific atlanta boxes have been deemed unsellable as the vast majority of the waivers that were granted last july by the fcc that allow domestic operators to continue to acquire these legacy boxes have expired the lack of domestic sales opportunities coupled with the limited international opportunities to sell our legacy scientific atlanta digital converter boxes have led us to reduce the carrying costs on these boxes to their potential scrap value
2993171 while the cable industry is currently facing a slow down the long term outlook for addvantage remains strong we continue to see a need for equipment upgrades in several large regions within the united states and expect the introduction of new competition to force the existing msos to upgrade their plants the expected upgrades coupled with oems having begun to scale back the manufacturing of equipment due to the decrease in current demand will allow us to play a bigger role when the decisions to upgrade are executed we have proven our ability to generate strong revenue and positive income in the near term and we believe are well positioned for the long term giving us a great amount of confidence in what lies ahead for addvantage
2993172 the second quarter was impacted by 500 000 of one time adjustments that included the write off of acquisition costs for the mega club the loss on a house for a relocated employee a robbery costs associated with the change of cfos and an incremental portion of stock option compensation expense the adjusted eps would have been 0 10 with these add backs
2993173 we have remained very focused as we continue to fine tune our operations financial model and management team to better position the company for stronger growth as we enter the second half of the year

2993180 this controversy all started because our daughter sincerely believed that she had her degree because of a meeting that everyone admits took place with the programs director in 1998 and when she contacted the university last year she was simply asking them to find the records that she believed would confirm that had they told her that after looking through their records they didnt have the proper documentation on file we honestly believe that while she may not have liked that answer she would have accepted it and moved on with her life

2993287 jeg synes den er flott den er akkurat slik den b r v re modellen er demokratisk samtidig som den er et godt instrument for kunnskapsoppbygging i tillegg er det en glimrende internasjonal kunnskapskanal utfordringen er hvordan man skal kvalitetssikre kunnskapen som presenteres p wikipedia
2993288 har ikke gjort det s langt men skulle gjerne gjort det mitt generelle inntrykk av wikipedia artikler er at det er lite feil men at de derimot ofte er for lite omfattende jeg har enn ikke kommet over faktuelle feil som f r det til krible i skrivefingeren det gj r jeg derimot andre steder
2993289 jeg synes at det er naturlig at forskere bidrar og mener at forskere burde bidra mer samtidig er en av styrkene ved wikipedia nettopp det at man ikke trenger en phd grad for publisere noe alle b r kunne f bidra wikipedia er en fantastisk og unik ressurs fordi den er global den er tilgjengelig for alle 24 timer i d gnet den er gratis og man er ikke avhengig av bruke store papirmengder slik som er tilfelle med tradisjonelle leksikon en annen fordel med wikipedia er at kunnskapen oppdateres kontinuerlig
2993290 jeg har ingen tro p konomiske insentiv og kan heller ikke se for meg at publikasjonspoeng eller lignende er noen god l sning denne typen insentiv strider dessutten mot wikipedias grunnide jeg tror kanskje det viktige er at man generelt s ker bevisstgj re forskere deres formidlingsansvar samtidig som man tydeliggj r wikipedias funksjon som kanal for kunnskapsformidling rent konkret ville det v rt en god ide l fte wikipediaproblematikken opp p instituttniv herfra burde man oppfordre forskere direkte til skrive redigere eller oversette wikipedia artikler en annen l sning som jeg synes er god er oppfordre og kanskje premiere mastergradstudenter og doktorgradstudenter for skrive artikler om de emnene de forsker p hvis i tillegg veilederen involveres har man ogs s rget for kvalitetssikring av kunnskapen en av grunnene til at mange forskere i liten grad involverer seg i wikipedia tror jeg er at artiklene er anonymisert det er imidlertid mulig skrive under fullt navn i wikipedia dette velger brukerne selv red anm derfor oppleves publisering p wikipedia som lite meritterende selv om det er mye idealisme blant forskere hvor mange er seg bevisste sitt formidlingsansvar prioriterer de fleste publisere i mer meritterende fora publisering i wikipedia blir enkelt velge bort
2993291 jeg er i all hovedsak positiv til wikipedia b de som ide og som prosjekt samtidig ser jeg ogs at wikipedia kan v re en kilde til feilinformasjon det kan ligge en bestemt agenda bak bidragene dette kjenner jeg godt til fordi nettopp klimafeltet er preget av sterke akt rer med sterke agendaer slik sett kan wikipedia brukes til undergrave kunnskap derfor bruker jeg aldri wikipedia som eneste informasjonskanal som en sikkerhetsmekanisme b r man alltid sjekke med ulike kilder
2993292 jeg vurderer artikkelen som ok men det er litt avhengig av hvem m lgruppen er jeg ser at artikkelen om drivhuseffekten p den engelske versjonen av wikipedia er mer utfyllende og fullstendig den norske versjonen blir nesten fordummende p grunn av forenklingen problemet er ikke f rst og fremst det som st r men det som mangler hvis jeg skulle skrevet artikkelen ville jeg ha innledet i enkle og generelle ordelag for deretter f lge opp med mer grundige og utf rlige forklaringer

2993394 my grandfather farmed with horses and i always said that if i had a place of my own i wanted to work it with horses
2993395 when we moved here some of our neighbors thought we were amish once the word got out that we were going to farm with horses some of the others probably thought we were crazy
2993396 some people have started to come around and ask what wed charge to cultivate their tobacco with the horses
2993397 with the price of gas i really think theres a growing interest in horses as a supplement to tractors
2993398 we sort of look at the farm as a small country and that we have to balance the exports and imports so that hopefully we come out on the positive side
2993399 we take organic sustenance away from the land when we produce cattle and hay but we try to put back just as much organic value as we take away and ideally put back even more

2993444 the only question is how much that standard should be we absolutely need to encourage renewables
2993445 focuses on the wrong thing on process how utilities generate power rather than on performance how much pollution they emit which is what ultimately counts
2993446 in essence renewable standards subsidies and other mandates assume that the government has all the answers rather than letting the market figure out the best way to produce energy at the lowest possible cost
2993447 doesnt have a lot of favor in the economic profession
2993448 creating competition between renewable energy developers by achieving economies of scale in manufacturing and through technological innovation
2993449 the reality is that not all states are fortunate enough to have abundant traditional renewable energy resources such as wind this is especially true in the southeast
2993450 will be required to purchase higher cost renewable energy from other suppliers
2993451 southeastern states have enough potential bioenergy incremental hydro solar wind and landfill gas resources to meet at least 50 percent of their current electric power needs
2993452 we are in full support of the governors climate change initiatives including the creation of a renewable portfolio standard we wholeheartedly believe the right rps policies will lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions as a clean energy company we want an rps that is in the best interest of our customers a florida rps should work toward securing our customers energy future to meet carbon reduction goals non emitting energy sources such as wind solar and nuclear should count toward satisfying any targets new renewable technologies can mean higher cost to the consumer these new policies should be introduced in the marketplace in a manner that maintains reliable electric service and reasonable electric prices
2993453 but we need to do pretty much everything we can if were going to reduce greenhouse gases
2993454 within the last three months weve had multiple companies racing each other through the doors
2993455 when we typically have little mountain ranges every time the air moves past its pushed up and over
2993456 theyre testing to see whether or not its sufficient for wind power development
2993457 oregon in the next couple of years will move from around ninth in the country for wind power production to maybe third
2993458 we may not have as much as people would like us to have available
2993459 you put up meteorological poles all over the place to test the wind because the one thing you can never mitigate for is bad wind
2993460 what youre looking for in wind energy is geographic diversity
2993461 where theres a big concentration of wind right now it peaks in the spring
2993462 the best and cheapest way to meet the renewable requirements is to do a majority of wind
2993463 i know there are at least four companies that have had some interest within harney county and i know that theres a minimum of 10 sites that at first glance they say might be doable
2993464 a lot of this has been what if until this point
2993465 what i hear is pretty positive support for having sustainable energy for getting away from dependence on foreign oil and the job creation
2993466 the landowner told me that this may provide his family with the opportunity to keep an old time ranch in one piece in their family for several generations
2993467 and that beats the heck out of 100 different ranchettes
2993468 to that extent were starting to get ready from a logistical standpoint
2993469 this things happening so fast that im not sure anybodys got it
2993470 were not trying to stop development there could be some detrimental effects if its not done right
2993471 our challenge is to go beyond the pure extraction of that resource
2993472 we want to see the turbines spinning and we want to see spin offs
2993473 we are sitting in the middle of wind central but they wind developers didnt look at us because of the perception that oklahoma was hostile to alternative energy
2993474 but we have the resource and now the light bulb has gone on
2993475 from my perspective oklahoma has a great opportunity in front of it that can help stabilize energy costs
2993476 the higher energy prices go the more attractive wind looks but it all has to come together with a good solid market and the transmission and great wind resources
2993477 wind is not going to solve all the generation problems
2993478 if you get a turbine on your farm it will bring the average of 5 000 to 8 000 a year and the price is going up
2993479 it used to be one developer might be knocking on the door now its several developers and a farmer can replace 10 in hay with a 5 000 turbine
2993480 the application for the windfarm is the correct place for objections to the proposed windfarm to be lodged
2993481 the current application has to be determined on its own individual merits
2993482 theyre putting in this application and theyve already got one in for some turbines its almost like the horse before the cart

2993540 part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month

2993551 im not a gannett employee nor do i consider myself an anti gannett whiner i am however a stockholder i find it pretty hard to get excited over the stock price being just over 18 when i purchased it at 84 00 a few years back if i knew then what i know now about the way gannett treats its employees and the shady practices they engage in i would have reconsidered my purchase how can a company perform well when the employees are so miserable maybe people would have a better outlook and stop complaining if this company would start listening to the needs of its employees i understand that layoffs are necessary during times of recession from what i can gather the employees also understand this they just want the company to be upfront with them

2993557 no es la primera vez que denunciamos la desidia del ayuntamiento en la limpieza y mantenimiento de esta zona que se agrava especialmente en los meses de primavera y verano cuando deber a ser una zona agradable para el paseo y el ocio
2993558 se trata de una plena responsabilidad del ayuntamiento de valladolid puesto que el pleno del ayuntamiento del 9 de febrero de 1999 acord que el servicio de jardines llevara a cabo el mantenimiento de este tramo del canal de castilla
2993559 los signos de suciedad y abandono son evidentes en este parque ni una sola de las farolas funciona unas est n destrozadas y otras no tienen bombilla

2993563 so yesterday was the welcoming ceremony where they officially raise the flag in front of your building and play the national anthem it is really an emotional moment especially for us athletes who have early events and never attend the opening ceremony
2993564 so for us in some way this was the small and intimate cutting of the ribbon and makes you feel proud that you are representing an entity so much larger than self
2993565 an olympic medal is my goal and i will not be satisfied till i get it
2993566 for me life will go on i sincerely hope that it changes how olympic sports is viewed in india
2993567 thats fine and good but the problem is this what do we buy you nobody knows what to get you because nobody knows anything that you like
2993568 there was an ethiopian family that we moved out it really broke my heart i remember that there even i cried the father kept on giving his little daughter candies to give to us the people who came to take them out just so she wouldnt be afraid of us he asked to speak with all of us and explained that ever since he arrived from ethiopia by foot in operation solomon in 1991 he has been wandering in israel among different caravan neighborhoods and only here in kfar darom did he finally succeed in building his house he asked us not to take him out forcefully as he wanted to go out by himself he took his little daughter in his hands and his suitcase and when he reached the door he just broke down in tears and crying held on to the doorpost and simply refused to part where is he today did he ever recover from what we did to him did he end up wandering again among caravans i dont know but that moment was shocking it it something that you remember every day something you get up with in the morning if you ignore it and leave it aside everything is fine but when you really think about it and the pictures return it is shocking its alive and kicking and painful and burning
2993569 were not yet in our permanent homes we have not yet reached our rest and inheritance to come and say to us were sorry without doing something to repair what they did has no meaning the soldiers who feel bad about what they do have to tell their commanders in that well oiled machine that they will not take part in another expulsion and they must go the people they threw out of their homes and see what they can do for them and they must educate their future children not to take part in something like this
2993570 but rather a national correction that must be made the nation of israel has to know that if someone destroyed an area in the land of israel it doesnt get solved just by saying sorry when it comes to the destruction of the land of israel there is no forgiveness
2993571 this is a day of happiness and joy that the palestinian people have not witnessed for a century

2993576 mit seiner operation in s dossetien hat russland drei dinge bewiesen 1 seine armee kann erfolgreiche operationen ausf hren woran ausl ndische beobachter gezweifelt haben 2 die russen k nnen die von den us milit rinstrukteuren getrimmten kr fte besiegen 3 russland hat bewiesen dass sich die usa und die nato nicht in der situation befinden die f r sie ein milit risches eingreifen in diesen konflikt erm glichen k nnte
2993577 au erdem galten diese signale polen und tschechien die das amerikanische raketenabwehrsystem bei sich aufstellen sollen russland bedroht nat rlich niemanden mit einer intervention es fordert aber alle auf die meinung ber das kr fteverh ltnis in der region zu revidieren
2993578 russland k nnte dies nur erreichen wenn es zu einem angriff bereit sein wird w hrend georgien berpr fen wird ob moskau blufft oder nicht folglich k nnen sich die russen keinen bluff leisten
2993579 moskau k nnte sich mehr w nschen und sogar kr fte einsetzen um das zu erreichen
2993580 je mehr diplomatische initiativen es aber geben wird die sich nicht auf st rke st tzen desto sicherer wird sich russland f hlen
2993581 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2993582 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everything is set up for him here so he can be successful
2993583 im going to gradually feed him back in i just want to see how hes doing thats my primary focus right now then well see about those other things well see where they fall in
2993584 he made it through this much of camp without a problem which he hasnt done in the past it has always happened sooner than this i guess im looking for a positive in the situation i expect him to get out and be ready to go here in the next little bit
2993585 enjoys starting at guard but if you asked him his choice hes going to tell you tackle
2993586 thats what he sees himself as hes doing a heck of a job right now at guard too hes having his best camp so far
2993587 with tra out there id rather play guard but if tra isnt out there id rather play tackle
2993588 i feel like its a little easier on your body and you get to use a little more of your athleticism at tackle instead of brute force i was a little rusty at it today
2993589 i think he could step in and be one of the better left tackles in this league he just hasnt had a chance to work there
2993590 ive been anxious ever since we got to camp to see shawn
2993591 i wanted to bring joy to the north korean people however i failed to do so and im very sorry
2993592 when bolt ran 9 72 i realized that i had to run a 9 6 to beat him and thats what i trained my mind to do
2993593 the record can go and the guys can go 9 6 i did it with a lot of wind but i feel i can go there without wind
2993594 this is one of the hottest 100s in history there hasnt been as much hype about it for a long time
2993595 i dont feel any aches or twitches ive been staying hydrated and im confident my body will hold up
2993596 i was really upset the same thing happened in 2004 and that memory rose up and started messing with me
2993597 athletes have a tendency to think they can do anything now i definitely know i have to look after my body a bit better
2993598 i guess it should be the world record holder but powell is very confident right now
2993599 there is pressure on bolt and i dont know how hes taking it hes a young guy and he likes to have fun regardless of what he says people are expecting him to win the gold medal im in the back but ive had some good practices
2993600 to have three guys who have run 9 7 i think its amazing and i cant overlook americans walter dix and darvis patton or any of the others
2993601 i think the torch was lit at 12 01 so it was actually on my birthday
2993602 the ceremony was the best experience of my life words cant even describe it
2993603 i cant believe it has all ended with a fall
2993604 you only have a second to make a decision and i made the wrong decision
2993605 hopefully in london 2012 olympics ill come out more experienced and have a better chance
2993606 any one of us could have made that shot any time
2993607 of course i was very tense i was under pressure and i was nervous but thats part of the game
2993608 when we were training for the olympics in korea we recreated these kind of situations
2993609 it was because i was aware of the possibility that we could win gold

2993619 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2993620 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2993621 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2993622 its good to send a signal to the chinese people that we respect them that this is about their country
2993623 he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
2993624 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2993625 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2993626 im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2993627 we took him out and are just easing him back in

2993646 how can you defend frances laws banning hijabs in public schools
2993647 theyve banned sikh turbans and the wearing of christian crosses and the jewish star of david as well
2993648 the law is against exhibiting overt religious symbols in public france is a secular country and it has every right to do so what if a european woman appears in a mini skirt on zainab market you will say since you are an islamic republic you have the right to ban such attire in public wouldnt you i think they tolerate a lot more hijabs and turbans in their country than we can ever tolerate crosses shorts and skirts in ours

2993659 the bank of england is concerned that customers are being issued too many 20 notes which is endangering the whole circulation of cash
2993660 the high street banks would like to see the end of cash because they can make money out of debit and credit cards purchases but thats not in the interest of the consumer
2993661 if people take out 60 at a time they are more likely to spend it but smaller notes such as 5 will help them keep track of money
2993662 the 5 notes have a vital part to play in the uk purchasing chain and i welcome this initiative by bank machine to give easier access to these notes in key atm locations throughout the uk

2993777 meist haben patienten lange leidenswege und zahlreiche diagnosen hinter sich wenn sie in unsere praxis kommen durch gr ndliche untersuchungen und modernste verfahren stellen wir hier ursachen sehr schnell fest und k nnen gezielt helfen
2993778 darunter versteht man degenerative h fterkrankungen als folge treten knorpelschwund und verlust von gelenkstrukturen auf schon einfache bewegungsabl ufe wie etwa auftreten gestalten sich u erst schmerzhaft

2993789 es ist bemerkenswert dass sich ein drittel der shopbetreiber entschieden hat gar keine provision in ihren shops zu verlangen
2993790 aber wenn man mit ihnen spricht versteht man diesen shopbetreibern ist klar welches potential darin liegt dass andere kleidungsst cke mit ihrer botschaft oder marke kaufen und auch tragen
2993791 uns haben kunden geschrieben um sich f r unsere newsletter zu bedanken und kaum jemand bestellt den newsletter ab
2993792 wir haben gelernt dass unsere kunden die anregungen f r die gestaltung von geschenken oder produkten die sie f r sich selbst bestellen sch tzen

2993811 the aztec culture had a lot of mummies and some of their mummy designs for the foundation army were taken from mexican mummies that they have found

2993817 it was fashionable earlier to have a clandestine extra marital affair as most of the stars were married so there was no point in declaring their affairs to the world but today if given a chance there would be a hidden camera even in a celebs bedroom so they have no choice but to reveal the dope about their affairs
2993818 they no longer want to be victims unlike the past when a divorced actress was looked upon as an on sale to bed item these days the personal life of a heroine doesnt affect her star status the perception of society has completely changed so leading ladies prefer dumping a stale mate rather than sulking in a dead bond

2993830 vision disorders are one of the leading impediments to successful learning in children
2993831 many vision problems goundetected because a child is told he or she has 20 20 vision and healthy eyes this can be misleading because their visual skills like tracking eye teaming and focusing may not have been evaluated and this is really where the problem lies
2993832 were dealing with far more than just eyesight our concern and primary focus is with identifying and treating a delay in the patients ability to access and process visual information in ways that are the necessary prerequisites for developmental learning these issues can be treated through vision therapy but particularly when diagnosed early

2993859 we need players with quality everton is a team already that has quality and we need to add to that moutinho of course is a good player and he is someone that i know he was a star at euro 2008 for portugal
2993860 he is sharp he plays good football and he drives his team forward he is also a leader if he wasnt there would be no way that he would be the captain of a big club like sporting at the age of 21
2993861 if we spend so much money on a player like him he would pay it back in the next few years i would like to see him here because he is portuguese but the reason i would want to see him here most is because he is a good player and will improve us

2993906 the summer is historically a dead time in recruiting so this has definitely changed the way were looking at how we fill our talent need
2993907 the smaller shops are realizing this is a great time to pick off talent
2993908 i think an average mba interested in investment banking is thinking he or she may need to look more broadly and i think the boutique firms will capitalize on that
2993909 theres a general anxiety among students now i dont think anyone trusts any of the companies whether its an investment bank corporation or a commercial bank anything could happen
2993910 we had a job offer rescinded from someone in the automotive industry so certainly there is risk across all the industries this year
2993911 we are back on campus in the fall for 2009 recruiting because the analysts and associates are our pipeline for officer levels in three years
2993912 at this point we dont have a hiring cap for the associates
2993913 some of the things the career services council members are speculating with the investment banks and the financial services companies is that they may be hedging a little bit
2993914 they are very reluctant to go first in terms of saying they are going to cut back on mba hiring
2993915 they can provide a little bit more of a stable option for some of our students
2993916 my mandate to the team is lets look for the rock stars because now is the time we can lock them down
2993917 we have had fewer declinations of our offers from this group and at the same time our recruiting efforts are the same as weve always had
2993918 at a larger consulting company when youre fresh out of business school you dont get that kind of access youre kind of the low man on the totem pole and youre expected to put your time in doing consulting grunt work

2993929 we cant say whether or not the shark took a swimming young bear
2993930 we dont know how active these sharks are as predators
2993931 theres no possibility a greenland shark could predate a live adult white bear unless it was injured or seriously ill
2993932 greenland sharks do seem quite sluggish but they have been known to move very quickly when they are eating
2993933 both walruses and polar bears are powerful in the water both could handle most potential predators but not killer whales
2993934 the greenland shark simply cannot afford the risk of injury nor the expenditure of energy required to kill such a large and dangerous animal with or without the help of
2993935 for polar bears the greater risk is a loss of habitat these other things will be ancillary

2993965 por exemplo um cliente que se diz agressivo deve ser bastante racional dedicar mais tempo an lise dos seus investimentos entre outros aspectos
2993966 ou seja alguns investidores desejam ser conservadores na ora de tomar riscos mas esperam taxas de retornos altas que seriam oferecidas aos mais agressivos

2993968 apostar na mega sena acumulada pode parecer mais tentador do que num cara ou coroa mas dadas as probabilidades seguramente o cara ou coroa tende a ser na m dia mais racional mais lucrativo exceto para o bilhete premiado
2993969 o teste serve para identificar a racionalidade do investidor e para confirmar uma hip tese de que os investidores t m em geral um sentimento bastante forte de avers o perda
2993970 no exemplo 76 escolheram a pior alternativa a menos racional pois ela leva a uma perda m dia de r 80 mil enquanto a alternativa leva a uma perda de r 50 mil
2993971 em geral os investidores preferem o ganho certo ainda que n o seja a op o mais racional pois na op o escolhida pela maioria o investidor teria um ganho de r 50 mil em vez de r 100 mil
2993972 uma perda dessas pode ser considerada uma posi o agressiva

2993990 with all of the hysteria all of the fear all of the phony science could it be that man made global warming is the greatest hoax every perpetrated on the american people it sure sounds like it
2993991 a survey commissioned by the national wildlife federation earlier this decade shows an overwhelming majority of hunters and anglers agree with the consensus in the scientific community that global warming is real that it is already eroding their quality of life and that it poses a definite threat to the future of two things they love fish and wildlife
2993992 pass legislation that sets a clear national goal for reducing global warming pollution with mandatory timelines because industry has already had enough time to clean up voluntarily
2993993 pennsylvanians who have hunted or fished for years are seeing the gradual but steady signs of global warming shorter winters earlier spring less snow fewer days of ice cover on lakes and ponds
2993994 wildlife species are the early indicators of global warming and its a real concern for people who value wildlife and understand what seemingly minor changes in climate can mean for the future of entire ecosystems

2994003 we also wanted to know about the history of the neandertals themselves
2994004 most argue there were a few thousand neandertals that roamed over europe 40 000 years ago
2994005 its still an open question for the future whether this small group of neandertals was a general feature or was this caused by some bottleneck in their population size that happened late in the game

2994018 saya penah menemani sheila selama dua tahun di jakarta dan selama itu pula saya selalu menemani kemanapun ia pergi tapi karena satu alasan saya harus kembali ke bali tujuannya untuk memberi pembelajaran kepada shila tentang hidup mandiri dan bertanggung pada diri sendiri
2994019 saya bilang ke sheila kalau narkoba bisa merusak otaknya yang cerdas dan dia janji nggak akan menggunakannnya
2994020 menurut saya penyebabnya diri sendiri namanya orang hidup kan punya pilihan

2994059 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
2994060 trust your gut instinct when those shopping decisions get tough say scientists
2994061 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
2994062 on the contrary our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously
2994063 this study demonstrates that direct pharmacological blockade of task 1 and task 3 channels protects the most sensitive target of fetal alcohol exposure cerebellar purkinje cells
2994064 weve been encouraging black men to get screened at age 40 or 45 for more than a decade yet only one third of these high risk men reported being tested
2994065 our findings provide an important baseline assessment of psa test use among young men as physicians debate whether to expand use of the psa test in young men with risk stratification strategies
2994066 even a subtle increase in the psa value at that age is a pretty powerful predictor of future prostate disease and cancer
2994067 right now only one in five men are getting a psa test which is encouraging but i wish the number was higher this research suggests we can do a better job of screening men at age 40 and a better job in high risk men theres a huge population of african american men who are not getting screened and men with a family history of prostate cancer who are under 50 are also not getting screened
2994068 much to our surprise the reaction of a membrane anchored prion protein differs from that of a prp in solution unstructured parts of the protein fold in a manner that makes it easy for another prion protein to be adsorbed the possible onset of the pathogenetic structure
2994069 high concentrations of prion protein at the membrane result in unstructured parts of the prion protein folding in a manner that makes it easy for numerous prion proteins to be adsorbed so called beta sheets comparable with two corrugated iron sheets develop enabling easy and perfectly fitting anchorage of the proteins

2994072 sheep and cattle constitute 11 per cent of australias total greenhouse gas emissions
2994073 kangaroos however produce relatively little methane because they are not ruminants
2994074 eating more kangaroo has an incredible array of benefits for our environment for dietary health and as a tasty red meat
2994075 the soft padded feet of kangaroos are far kinder to the land than the hooves of sheep and cattle which have caused untold damage and consequent land erosion
2994076 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
2994077 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
2994078 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
2994079 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
2994080 we had an awesome race and we were pushed by the french and the australians and we all came together and thats how we were able to go so fast
2994081 when i flipped at the 50 and i still saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder a thought really crossed my mind for a split second theres no way
2994082 and then i changed i said you know what its ridiculous this is the olympics im here for the united states of america and i dont care how bad it hurts or whatever im gonna go out there and just put it and honestly in like 5 seconds i was thinking all these things and just got like a supercharge and just took it from there and it was it was unreal
2994083 i just knew that last 15 or 20 meters was going to be out of control i just remember sitting there pounding on the blocks saying the f word saying come on i just remember looking at the finish and it was a perfect touch and i looked at the block and then i was just ecstatic
2994084 you know the french team was talking a little trash fired me up more than anything else
2994085 i think michael knows we did not do this for him he was just a part of it and we were a part of it
2994086 if you step into this arena youll see a thing of beauty its really a thing of absolute beauty
2994087 its a perfect depth because if its too deep you lose your sense of vision and where youre at in the pool but its just deep enough to where the waves dissipate and the turbulence dissipates down to the bottom
2994088 its physics and its not sports but it makes sense
2994089 you make a deeper and a wider pool and you give all of those waves and all of that splashing and all of that moving water a chance to move away from the swimmers and get out of their way which makes them go faster its as simple as that
2994090 everything is just fantastic about this pool ive never seen such a big facility in my life and you get a great feeling walking into that facility knowing that this is where the olympic games are held
2994091 technology has really kind of tapped out as far as the building of these kinds of facilities
2994092 its not like track and field where the types of tracks just get faster and faster because i guess there is more spring to them
2994093 but i dont know how you make fast water its just not possible
2994094 the whispered allegations about john edwards were an open secret that was debated in every newsroom and reported by almost none when critics especially on the right accused the media of protecting a democrat because of liberal bias journalists were unable to respond because to do so would be to acknowledge the very thing they were declining to report in the end the much derided msm were superfluous their monopoly a faded memory people have hundreds of ways to obtain information in todays instantaneous media culture and are capable of reaching their own conclusions about what is reliable and what is not
2994095 what else are they not telling us for fear it will hurt the democrats prospects

2994124 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2994125 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2994126 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2994139 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2994140 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2994141 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2994142 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2994143 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2994144 i think the biggest risk is the competition between the program groups that are adding things to the mix
2994145 for instance right now you have linq to sql and the entity framework which seem to solve some of the same problems with very different approaches
2994146 microsoft is notorious for introducing overlapping technologies people look at microsoft and assume that they will err on fragmentation vs controlled choice
2994147 we are looking at factored subsets of net that make good sense for specific scenarios
2994148 since framework teams at microsoft can develop managed code software so much faster than they could using c their own efforts are dramatically accelerated they no longer have the time to do coordination with other teams such coordination would quickly become the bottleneck to getting their own efforts out the door in a culture such as microsoft which values shipped software above all else such a bottleneck will by necessity be bypassed
2994149 theres no doubt that it is down to the credit crunch people just cant afford to keep their dogs anymore theyre just dumping them on the streets
2994150 we have to put this match behind us and start the next game almost as if its our first
2994151 they managed to exploit our defensive weaknesses which is something we had prepared for so that just shows the calibre of their team they can find your weaknesses even if youve worked so hard to get it right
2994152 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2994153 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2994154 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2994155 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2994156 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2994157 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2994158 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2994159 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2994164 why the h would i want to play with a gd doll
2994165 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2994166 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2994167 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2994168 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2994169 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2994170 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2994171 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2994172 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2994173 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2994174 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2994175 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2994176 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2994177 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2994178 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2994179 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2994180 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2994181 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2994182 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2994183 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2994184 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2994185 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2994186 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2994187 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2994188 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2994189 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2994190 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2994191 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2994192 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2994193 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2994194 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2994195 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2994196 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2994197 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2994198 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2994199 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2994200 cloud computing is one of those catch all buzz words that tries to encompass a variety of aspects ranging from deployment load balancing provisioning business model and architecture like web2
2994201 i view cloud computing as a broad array of web based services aimed at allowing users to obtain a wide range of functional capabilities on a pay as you go basis that previously required tremendous hardware software investments and professional skills to acquire cloud computing is the realization of the earlier ideals of utility computing without the technical complexities or complicated deployment worries
2994202 i think clouds are the next hype term for the next year or two people are coming to grips with virtualization and how it reshapes it creates service and software based models and in many ways changes a lot of the physical layer we are used to clouds will be the next transformation over the next several years building off of the software models that virtualization enabled

2994204 breastfeeding yields the same contraindication tagline over and over and
2994205 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2994206 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2994207 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2994208 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2994209 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2994210 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2994211 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

2994217 nicole won wales first olympic gold since 1972 and continues wales amazing sporting year
2994218 and its great to see a fellow welshie do it we havent one an olympic gold for a while so it was a long time in coming
2994219 im proud of her and im sure the whole of wales is too as it is so tough to even qualify for an olympics let alone win a gold medal
2994220 were only a little country but nevertheless wales is a proud sporting nation that does punch above its weight on the international stage
2994221 but as a country weve set high standards and the different sports buzz off each others success and i want to live up to those standards
2994222 our success is because talented athletes work hard are dedicated determined have the right attitude and live a professional lifestyle and the welsh have shown they are big game players
2994223 the great news about nicoles victory spread through the great britain team like wildfire
2994224 everyone was elated it instantly gave the team a little confidence booster
2994225 success breeds success and im so pleased and proud because nicoles a local girl she only lives ten minutes down the road from my house in barry
2994226 ive known her for ages and know how hard she has worked for this achievement and im a pleased because she was so gutted when she didnt win a medal in athens
2994227 her and rebeccas gold have certainly whet the appetite i want one for myself
2994228 a levels have been part of my life every summer since 1981 when i awaited the results of my first a level teaching group last year when tabitha my younger daughter took as levels i was in the difficult position of being both her mum and her headmistress i believe the student has the right to know her results first and disliked having to see them when they arrived in school the day before but there was nothing we could do about it we stuck by the rule which says no one can have their results until 6am on the day tabitha moved out and came to school to get them with everyone else it was hard for her and for me especially as i knew her grades were not quite what she had hoped for this year she has to move out of her home again and ill be in school with a big hug whatever happens because thats what mothers do i expect shell be up all night like everyone else glued to the internet to see if the universities have posted confirmation of places on the internet tabitha is aiming high and needs three a grades to read law at kings college london will she do it i really hope so i dont think she could have worked any harder her teachers are confident and she deserves it but its a tough offer and you just dont know what will happen on the day it doesnt make it any easier when you see headlines in the news saying a levels have got easier they havent theyre just different my daughter at 18 knows a lot more than i did and has done a lot more than i had at the same age in the run up to results they need all the support you can give them but on the day its important for parents to take a bit of a back seat the young person needs to be put in charge but thats not to say you dont love them and care for them and will be giving them a hug and brewing the tea the advice i give my parents which i find almost impossible to observe myself is not to treat exam results as the be all and end all your child will be fine she may not have quite the grades she wanted but she still has all the skills and attributes the grade is just a paper endorsement of what they have achieved its difficult when you have a child sobbing in your arms because they havent got the magic240 ucas points they wanted equivalent to four asat as level tabitha got an a and four bs in her as exams its hard to say it doesnt matter because it does to them with tabby we were all surprised at her grades but shes repaired it with resits it seems like a disaster on the day if you drop from a predicted a to a b or from a b to a c and students have to be reminded that these are still very good grades that a lot of people would be very glad to have they may have to take a slightly different route to get what they want but in my experience they all settle down and by the time prize giving comes along in september we have the school hall full of happy girls who have got where they want to be if you make sure they have prepared themselves for all eventualities they wont panic so much if they do miss their place one of the things parents find really hard is that universities dont deal with them nearly as well as they do with the students the student has to make the calls to the university to see if their place will be confirmed or to seek alternative courses by all means go onto the internet and see where there are places because there will be places even at russell group universities telephoning or emailing the university yourself is not necessarily going to help and may actually hinder because universities expect their future students to be able to stand on their own feet it may be that your child will want to challenge the result in which case she should get in touch with her teachers and see what they think the request has to come from the school and i would certainly recommend it when the teacher doesnt understand the mark or the grade is way off estimate weve had students who have been wrongly marked tabbys gcse history went up a grade when re marked it has to be done quickly and i cant think of an example at this school where a university has failed to honour a place when there has been a marking error ultimately the choice is theirs but you can help them to think through the reasons they applied for a course and identify the things that are important to them they will probably find other courses which meet all the same criteria my advice is to be your childs keenest supporter on the day enable them but dont try to do it for them
2994229 im very nervous and just trying to put it out of my mind no one is allowed to use the r word in our house ive banned it im doing my best to enjoy the summer by keeping busy the awful thing is that on the day before the results i wont be able to speak to my own mother because shes my head teacher its really horrible because your mum understands you best and shes the one you want to be with when youre in a state of panic ive got to move out to a friends house and i wont even be able to speak to my mother on the telephone because weve got a rule that we dont speak to each other she knows id be trying to decipher my results from her voice if she was too nice to me i would know id done badly ive taken english history and government and politics last year i did two as levels general studies and maths and got an a and a b and now ive got to get three as to get into kings college for law which is a tall order its very hard to get in for law but i like a challenge helena is always teasing me because i remember getting 100 per cent in a mental arithmetic test when i was eight or nine but she cant resist going around saying five a s and five a grades which is what she got at gcse i didnt do as well as she did at gcse because i was a bit of a rebel at 16 i hope im catching up with her now but who knows taking exams is like jumping through hoops meeting assessment objectives and making sure you get in the exact words to get marks under each of the criteria if i dont get the grades ive got a total back up plan i either go to kings with three as or if i dont do so well ill spend the year travelling and helping at the st michaels children of the rainbow orphanage in malindi kenya where i went last summer it was such a life changing experience to see how lucky we are and how something so little can change someones life ill probably apply for a different course perhaps politics because in my opinion there is no point in doing law if im not one of the best my mums a teacher and my fathers a university lecturer but theyve never been pushy parents i push myself really i just want to make them proud of me
2994230 ive just graduated from nottingham with a 2 1 in english and french so ive got results over with unlike tabby
2994231 possible exception of cyprus in 1974 the council of europe has never had to tackle a situation where two member states were at war
2994232 the reasons cited by the russian authorities do not justify military action in the territory of georgia regardless of whether the action is taken in the province of south ossetia or in other parts of georgia
2994233 we have seen powers before claiming that the violations of the rights of holders of their passports or their nationality by a previous germany in eastern europe or a previous serbia in former yugoslavia justify them sending their armies into these countries
2994234 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2994235 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2994236 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2994237 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2994238 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2994239 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2994240 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2994241 who are open to doing something on the production side
2994242 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2994243 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2994244 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2994245 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2994246 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2994255 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2994256 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2994257 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2994258 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2994259 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2994260 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2994261 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2994262 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics
2994263 they only planned on a week there which is a bit unusual as they still have some time together before he continues military training
2994264 i have a new album coming out on concord records but i havent titled it yet
2994265 im also in a new movie with bernie mac and sam jackson called soul men
2994266 songs like walk on by and shaft of course were real good
2994267 i got my start with simon davis and worked with guys like nat cole and sam and dave
2994268 and we did baby with carla thomas my backup singers worked with carla and otis redding and i did the horn composition
2994269 being a parent well you do the best you can
2994270 you have to laugh when you make a mistake which you cannot avoid
2994271 she gives us the expertise on what is current and what frankly is funny about kids and their parents and jay falzone nancys writing partner and i write it it is wonderful to have a collaboration with someone you have known all your life
2994272 its my potty and ill try if i want to
2994273 we think that our audience is mostly parents and grandparents so we choose songs from that era when they were young
2994274 part of the fun is thinking about the original song and relating to it with those new lyrics
2994275 each place seems to like different aspects of the show
2994276 im sure something will be big in philadelphia something will strike a chord
2994277 im still not a grandmother so i am still going through all this parenting stuff
2994278 i never know when i will retool a song there could be a parenting crisis at any moment
2994279 in the video game industry if you sell a million copies you throw a ticker tape parade
2994280 if youre selling five to six million copies of the same title every year youve just won the super bowl world series and stanley cup combined
2994281 people who want to play with their favorite quarterback or their favorite team
2994282 hard core players can do hundreds of hours of labbing playing all the different teams to find an edge
2994283 theres a crazy amount of dedication to finding out ways to win this game
2994284 then its a race to figure out the game the players change but mostly its what ea does with the game the new features
2994285 mostly practice and reaction time and getting everything down so you dont have to think about it while youre playing
2994286 randy moss has a big advantage over any defensive back
2994287 just throw the ball up and hell go get it
2994288 im very competitive and i like to match wits with other opponents
2994289 i love to talk trash thats the best part of the game for me
2994290 if youre playing a good defensive back like antonio cromartie why would the ball go through his hands and hit him in the face
2994291 ea does it because they dont want the backs to have outrageous interception stats but its really annoying
2994292 it should balance out between someone with twitch skills and someone who knows football strategy
2994293 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2994294 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2994295 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2994296 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2994297 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2994298 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2994299 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2994300 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2994301 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2994302 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2994303 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2994304 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2994305 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2994306 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2994307 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2994308 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2994309 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2994310 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2994311 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2994312 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2994313 look at me whoever youre scared of theyre not your problem anymore
2994314 theyve gone so far out of their way to have batman taken seriously that all of the fun has been sucked out of it with
2994315 you know love dont mean nothing really im not a fan of love people fall in and out of love every day let the lights go off and see how much they love you dont let anything be on that table at 5 oclock in the evening and see how much she loves you let that car keep breaking down and see how much she loves you i really believe out of 27 years of being with my wife that we went through that transition that we like each other and i think thats the most important thing i truly like her shes my friend you know and i wouldnt trade her for nothing in the world
2994316 publicly and unequivocally deny the whole thing and sue the

2994318 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2994319 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2994320 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2994321 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2994322 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2994323 ive never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved
2994324 ive never asked anybody to pay a dime of money never been told that any moneys been paid nothing has been done at my request so if the allegation is that somehow i participated in the payment of money that is a lie an absolute lie which is typical of these types of publications
2994325 published in a supermarket tabloid that is absolutely not true
2994326 i cannot make any sense out of that when i went to this meeting youve already asked me about uh i was not wearing a t shirt i was wearing a long sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up i dont know who that picture i dont know if that picture is me it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what that picture is
2994327 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2994328 i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2994329 that line like a tree planted by the water i shall not be moved
2994330 it seemed to sum up what everyone struggling to come back after katrina was feeling i really wanted to bring the city together with that thought
2994331 folk tradition of adapting and transforming songs to serve as anthems to galvanize people in a cause
2994332 everything has changed since katrina even our neighborhoods arent familiar anymore
2994333 youre talking about kids who lost everything their homes their schools and friends
2994334 for some of these kids this music is all they really feel they have and they are very excited about this project
2994335 maybe you should check the baby sitter list at the gym and find someone else
2994336 and i wanted zac efron but you know what everyones going to have to live with a little bit of disappointment

2994381 people will never believe this so id better explain it
2994382 for you knew you had a much more solid and lasting treasure in heaven
2994383 because you knew you had something better something that would last forever
2994384 he is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose
2994385 all these people were still living by faith when they died they did not receive the things promised they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance and they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth
2994386 see there it is what a beautiful land and look at all those people they are waving back at us
2994387 people who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own if they had been thinking of the country they had left they would have had opportunity to return instead they were longing for a better country a heavenly one

2994393 western companies in these areas are seen coming they walk in and their cost rate is about 30 to 40 per cent of the uk and then guess what they discover the dollar and the rates go up
2994394 they also have high staff rotation because they move from one to another as the salaries go up
2994395 high labour rates are nullified by creativity and quality there is an aspect of this you cant put a price on and that is the value of creativity
2994396 when you create hits they render development costs relative for me its about creating global hits and then development costs become an academic part of it
2994397 i would say that british development is sought after you only have to look at the activities of companies like sony warner bros take two thq ea and disney all of whom have bought uk developers at some time and made some of them very successful
2994398 uk development is worth investing in it is strong vibrant and creative and as far as im concerned its a case of rule britannia

2994414 we american yokels cant speak french or spanish we eat too much our cars are too big our houses either overheated or overcooled and we dont even put enough air in our tires

2994418 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2994419 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2994420 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2994421 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

2994427 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2994428 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2994429 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2994430 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2994431 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2994432 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2994433 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2994434 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2994435 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2994436 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2994437 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools

2994440 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2994475 great britain sort of controlled the middle 1 000 meters and obviously we have to go back and try to find a way to contain them there
2994476 it wasnt an easy race but i felt like at the 1 000 meter mark it had the potential to be under control
2994477 but its the olympics and nobody mellows out at the 1 000 even if they are up on the pack it was definitely a push all the way to the finish as everybody wants that top seed
2994478 weve been working for many years and our guys have been preparing for london in 2012 we have plenty of talent that longs to make history and demonstrate what the cuban school of boxing is capable of doing

2994496 you see many gruha praveshams are generally conducted during late in the nights this is a formal muhurtham and hence it had to be done now there is no secrecy in it everything is open
2994497 you have inaugurated the party office does it mean that you are actually confirming your entry into politics
2994498 do you still have the doubts after seeing the developments all these days
2994499 what does it mean by a couple of days on august 13

2994509 i think the goal at the beginning of the week every player here would have said if anybody was under par they would take it
2994510 every hole it seemed like those guys were making something it was fun to hear and a lot of fun to play in a championship like this
2994511 people in michigan are getting excited this is the best they have seen someone in a detroit lions outfit play in a long time
2994512 obviously wearing the detroit lions gear doesnt hurt they want to see someone wearing a lions hat win
2994513 of the three you said there i really do like the fact no other european has won two majors consecutively obviously i hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem to achieve something they hadnt is very special
2994514 the wind was blowing and the fairways were soft making it extra long and then the pins were very tough in the afternoon
2994515 although yes we had 213 instances of false positives we were able to get 30 000 people tested and those that were negative we could tell them they were negative
2994516 le pido por favor mir ndola a los ojos que diga qui n se la ha dado la epo porque vamos a ir a por esa persona este da o esta irresponsabilidad se puede rebajar si se dan nombres

2994525 al lado del secretario de estado por c mo est trabajando contra el dopaje
2994526 hoy es un momento duro pero no es para echarnos a llorar estamos persiguiendo el dopaje como pocos pa ses en el mundo
2994527 si se han hecho seis controles en el ltimo mes lo que no se puede hacer es perseguir hasta su casa a los corredores para ver qu se toman o qu se inyectan
2994528 defiendo al deporte espa ol y a la federaci n espa ola de ciclismo no vamos a conseguir que nunca haya dopaje pero lucharemos las 24 horas contra l
2994529 nosotros confiamos en los atletas espa oles hay 286 atletas y me quedo con los 285 que no se han dopado

2994534 de rechtbank is van oordeel dat het merk fluvirin en het teken fluralin zowel in auditief visueel als begripsmatig met elkaar overeenstemmen het feit dat merk en teken dezelfde fonetische structuur hebben de klemtoon in beide gevallen op de laatste lettergreep ligt en beide merken beginnen met flu en eindigen op in maakt dat de totaalindruk van de merken auditief nagenoeg gelijk is ook in visueel opzicht is de totaalindruk gelijk zowel het merk fluvirin als het teken fluralin bestaan uit 8 letters waarvan 6 op dezelfde plaats met medeklinkers en klinkers op dezelfde plaats omdat fluvirin en fluralin mede door het feit dat ze beiden samengesteld zijn uit afkortingen hetzelfde beeld oproepen is er ook enige begripsmatige overeenstemming overigens merkt de rechtbank op dat het ontbreken van sterke begripsmatige overeenstemming gezien de sterke auditieve en visuele gelijkenis van merk en teken niet meer aan het bestaan van voornoemde overeenstemming afdoet met de aanwezigheid van een sterke auditieve en visuele gelijkenis is reeds aan de voor overeenstemming gestelde strengere eisen voldaan
2994535 met novartis is de rechtbank van oordeel dat zelfs bij een zeer oplettend publiek bestaande uit artsen verplegers en apothekers gevaar voor verwarring kan bestaan omtrent de herkomst van het product dat zij weten dat zowel fluvirin als fluralin als griepvaccin voorgeschreven dan wel gebruikt kan worden betekent nog niet dat zij in staat zijn fluvirin en fluralin direct aan respectievelijk novartis en solvay te verbinden verwarringsgevaar is dan ook aannemelijk dat solvay aanvoert fluralin altijd in combinatie met het in medische kringen bekende paraplumerk solvay te gebruiken doet daar niet aan af niet gebleken is dat een arts solvay fluralin voorschrijft in plaats van fluralin daarbij komt dat uit de door solvay bij conclusie van antwoord in conventie tevens conclusie van eis in reconventie overgelegde fotos van medicijnverpakkingen van solvay blijkt dat het paraplumerk solvay apart en slechts in een kleiner lettertype rechtsonder op de verpakking wordt vermeld

2994537 i didnt blow anything and so i can go home happy with my performance
2994538 but unfortunately its a partnership you both have to be on the top of your game i wasnt on the top of my game but tom was nowhere near the top of his
2994539 i knew we were capable of a medal but i knew it would depend on how tom performed but i outdived thomas today and thats not something that normally happens and that to me is because tom had a lot more pressure on him than i did tom was very nervous more so than ever before and i think he really struggled to get through the competition
2994540 i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone
2994541 that is thomas over nervous that is how it was today thomas should not be worrying about what im doing today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is the sole reason why he didnt perform today
2994542 we send a special thank you to the people of beijing the people of new zealand and of course the people of america

2994608 but playing lara croft the sexiest game heroine there is should get me a few more dates
2994609 it was not an unreasonable calculation to go for a rapid win but in the end it was a miscalculation
2994610 the capital tskhinvali is relatively small no more than around 25 000 people and they probably thought they could just take it and be done
2994611 they may have calculated that some people would leave the region and flee north to north ossetia but the rest would stay and the problem would basically be resolved
2994612 the russians have been provoking for a long time and i dont doubt that they stoked up the separatists to start attacking
2994613 at the same time if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily and at this stage it seems uncertain that they will stop
2994614 if the russians hadnt intervened and georgia had taken over some south ossetians would have fled but most probably would have been okay and south ossetia probably would have been better off economically and culturally
2994615 we erected barricades at several places on the srinagar muzafarrabad road
2994616 we have suffered a loss of at least 20 million rupees about nz688 000 since this agitation began
2994617 and if the blockade continues it will be a disaster for us
2994618 we were able to contain the fighting in north cotabato areas and we dont see it spreading across the muslim areas
2994619 we are always looking at humanitarian disaster everytime huge numbers of people are driven from their homes
2994620 they could be worried about it spreading about it becoming just general fighting
2994621 unless we get a full blown war over there then thats the only time it might significantly affect markets

2994626 i must apologise again for deciding to come to live in england if i am fortunate enough i will return and die on thai soil just like other thais
2994627 thaksins exile is another victory for us but our ultimate goal is to finish off the thaksin regime by kicking out his puppet government
2994628 these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
2994629 he has defamed the court and so hes gone for good
2994630 he is quite an emotional fellow and he has lashed out very often in the past
2994631 my guess is that over the last few weeks and months hes splashed out a lot of money to try and get himself out of this and its failed and hes very angry
2994632 when all of the judicial and appeal processes have exhausted themselves if any of the three are subject to a death penalty australia will make a plea of clemency on their behalf at that time
2994633 all legal avenues have not fully been exhausted thats why the question of clemency is not on the table yet
2994634 when i flipped at the 50 and saw how far ahead he was knowing he was the world record holder for a split second a thought crossed my mind there is no way
2994635 but i said you know what this is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts honestly in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got like a super charge and just took it from there it was unreal
2994636 i gave it everything i had possibly but they got me on the end i feel like i should have got my hand on the wall first
2994637 this morning bob bowman had said the french was saying some stuff talking a little bit of trash

2994641 national survey data show that the prevalence of overweight and obese adults in the u s has increased steadily over the past three decades
2994642 if these trends continue more than 86 percent of adults will be overweight or obese by 2030 with approximately 96 percent of non hispanic black women and 91 percent of mexican american men affected this would result in 1 of every 6 health care dollars spent in total direct health care costs paying for overweight and obesity related costs

2994657 i just want my boy back this is so hard and i hope he is lost somewhere said ms munohur who holds out hope that yadav is alive
2994658 we are here for him he is not alone he has his father mother sisters and family in mauritius
2994659 he is a very smart careful and loving child with a captivating smile
2994660 i was preparing dinner and yadav wanted to go to the park and i said just as soon as i have finished cooking we will be able to go
2994661 he was so enthusiastic and said he could manage by himself and ran out i heard the door slam
2994662 i asked some boys from scotch college who said he went to the park she said
2994663 we are trying every avenue of inquiry he may have slipped into the fast flowing creek and drowned he may be lost or he may be hiding from us we dont know what the story is said senior sergeant joe connor of boroondara police
2994664 he was a lost boy in india in a bombay mumbai orphanage and his survival skills would be more than that of other nine year old boys
2994665 inspiration to adopt yadav as a seven year old from mumbai and give him a better life
2994666 he was a lost child in india and had a difficult childhood that was not normal she said
2994667 sometimes he would explain to me that he got lost on a train from kalyan to mumbai and the police took him to the ashram orphanage for his safety
2994668 whenever he sees a train he looks at the train you cant explain what it feels like as a mother
2994669 we were a very happy family and already had the idea of coming here for our childrens education and had to go back to scratch and find a home and jobs ms munohur said

2994677 ice chief calls for congress to discipline lawmaker for gestapo remark by john bicknell cq staff
2994678 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at homeland security they are in charge
2994679 aside from being demeaning to the law enforcement officers that uphold the very laws passed by mr gutierrezs congress its potentially dangerous no member of congress should be encouraging the public to defy or demean federal law enforcement officers words matter
2994680 what happens is the public image of you becomes one of not this compassionate law enforcement agency but essentially a gestapo type agency that is knocking on doors

2994724 if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily at this stage it seems uncertain that they will stop
2994725 i just hope but i have no high expectations that the international community will be able to stop the russians at this stage i dont think anyone can say with certainty what their objectives are will they stop with south ossetia and abkhazia
2994726 its payback time by the russians for what the west did in kosovo the russians are in a very strong position what we have to try to do as western countries is impose some form of consequence on russia
2994727 i believe the georgians were suckered into this and paid a very heavy price
2994728 it was not an unreasonable calculation to go for a rapid win but in the end it was a miscalculation
2994729 the capital tskhinvali is relatively small no more than around 25 000 people and they probably thought they could just take it and be done
2994730 its a region thats not a viable state its delusional for the south ossetians to think they could be independent
2994731 if it hadnt been for the russian intervention then the separatists would have been rolled over very quickly they wouldnt have had a prayer
2994732 some south ossetians would have fled but most probably it would have been okay and south ossetia probably would have been better off economically and culturally
2994733 as it is now they are looking at being a small outpost on the southern reaches of russia
2994734 this is not and was never about south ossetia south ossetia is a place where russia found a pretext for military aggression against georgia
2994735 georgia was made an example of concerning the cost of standing up to russia and developing a country independently and thinking to join euro atlantic institutions
2994736 its basically the putin doctrine restoring russian control over the former soviet union irrespective of what those countries want which is why this is so reminiscent of the episodes in prague in 1968 and budapest in 1956
2994737 its a return to the spheres of influence and an attempt to undermine the entire building of the european zone of prosperity and security this is the biggest thing to happen in europe at least since the balkan wars and it might have much larger implications
2994738 the only way to reduce tensions is to have an extremely strong response
2994739 both georgia and russia have been much less cautious than the market had expected this has developed in quite an unexpected way its very hard to make any calls right now on how the war situation will develop or how it will impact emerging markets
2994740 obviously there has been a significant impact on russian assets it is a reminder that geopolitical risk is there in these markets which are a lot of people had chosen to ignore
2994741 obviously people will also be looking at the baltics ukraine the former soviet republics with borders with russia
2994742 the big difference is that you do not have any particular disputed border regions except for a very small area of estonia or areas of any particular areas with a large russian population
2994743 i think saakashvili knew from the very beginning that russia would invade ossetia after georgian troops were sent there saakashvili did that on purpose and wanted to show the world what russia is like today
2994744 saakashvili is playing his media game for the conscience of the western world the price is high but he is very convincing
2994745 this will distance georgias nato membership in the formal terms but in practice in the geopolitical sense this is strengthening georgias nato perspective
2994746 the kremlin must understand that it is making a dramatic mistake by using force in georgia for the first time since 1991 in a post soviet neighbourhood and the international community must consistently explain that to russia
2994747 i still believe the fighting will stop quite quickly because the long term interests remain the same for georgia this is not to resolve the situation by force and for russia basically not to resolve it at all
2994748 i think the tempers will cool and the parties will sit down at the negotiating table and basically return the situation where it was before this conflict
2994749 the disproportion of the forces is so big that the war does not have much sense and basically it is not in either sides interest to continue
2994750 in this telephone conversation they voiced their satisfaction at the constructive trend of negotiations in geneva and in subsequent contact they described the trend of these negotiations as constructive
2994751 nothing has changed we stick to the two track approach the channels of communication remain open
2994752 on the one side pressure for sanctions in the united nations security council but also the offer of dialogue for the iranians to come to the table to discuss the package of incentives which has been proposed to them
2994753 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
2994754 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone
2994755 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
2994756 russia of course will take its peacekeeping mission to a logical conclusion we will strive for working relations with all participants of this conflict and that of course includes the georgian side
2994757 t he doctrine of invited error is implicated when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error and where such error exists we are precluded

2994785 you can leave the leaflets in libraries and various places and people can pick them up if they are interested

2994787 the information leaflet gives a summary of the facts and the issues at stake as we see them and encourages people to respond to the consultation whatever their views

2994799 on dissertation proposals on which i have served patton is by far the most cited qualitative research text
2994800 i am dazzled by the extent of the material that this book describes and clarifies patton has shifted the focus of the text to qualitative inquiry in general which includes qualitative evaluation new examples from his own work and that of others serve to clarify and deepen understanding of qualitative research topics and processes new discussion of many current issues and debates in qualitative scholarship autoethnography ethical issues of informed consent and confidentiality focus group group interviews computer assisted analysis the complexity of creating criteria for judging the quality of qualitative research etc will bring readers up to date with the variety in perspectives about and the variety within qualitative inquiry most of the chapters in the book have been substantially reorganized in ways that augment the readers understanding when anyone asks me about conducting qualitative inquiry i will say get pattons book
2994801 clearly this is a vastly improved much more comprehensive cogently systematic and timely review a tour de force one might say of the field of qualitative research in terms of the theoretical conceptual methodological and normative dimensions foundations of qualitative research

2995000 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2995001 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2995002 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2995041 ich wollte gehen als ich ersatzspieler war wenn man jung ist und nicht spielt wird dein talent verschwendet
2995042 aber die vereinsf hrung hat mich als wichtigen erg nzungsspieler gesehen
2995043 als spieler will man jedes spiel von anfang an machen und tore schie en
2995044 die leute haben gesagt dass ich als einwechselspieler besser bin und so habe ich diesen spitznamen bekommen aber es gibt zeiten da spielt man nicht so gut wenn man von anfang an spielt
2995045 ich w rde gerne f r eine mannschaft aus diesen ligen spielen weil sie meistens mit zwei st rmern spielen lassen was gro e m glichkeiten bietet tore zu erzielen

2995051 wir wollen die bundeswettbewerbsbeh rde zu einer vollen wettbewerbsbeh rde machen zu einer beh rde mit entscheidungsbefugnis in erster instanz mehr ermittlungsbefugnissen und den bundeskartellanwalt gem koalitionsvereinbarung in die bwb integrieren damit wird die bwb zu einer beh rde mit mehr biss nach europ ischem vorbild
2995052 die teuerung bereitet uns gro es kopfzerbrechen sie betrifft nicht nur sterreich sondern letztlich alle konsumenten dieser welt weil die inflationsrate auch weltweit viel zu hoch ist mehr wettbewerb ist ein mittel um im gegebenen rahmen hoher treibstoff und nahrungsmittelpreise zumindest die inflation einzugrenzen das steht au er frage
2995053 in den vergangenen jahren gab es eine vielzahl von aufforderungen zur st rkung der bwb die seit 2002 erfolgreich besteht aber jetzt soll sie erwachsen gemacht werden indem sie mehr ermittlungsbefugnisse sowie entscheidungsbefugnisse erster instanz erh lt
2995054 jetzt ist die zeit n gel mit k pfen zu machen jetzt ist die zeit der nagelprobe auch f r den koalitionspartner und die ak ob sie bei der st rkung der bwb mitgehen
2995055 die aktuelle regelung sieht vor dass die entscheidungsbefugnis erst beim kartellgericht liegt die bwb hingegen ist lediglich antragsberechtigt
2995056 die bwb kann damit bis zu f nf prozent des durchschnittlichen tagesumsatzes einfordern
2995057 derzeit braucht die bwb so gut wie f r alles eine gerichtliche entscheidung das ist kein zustand daher ist es sinnvoll jetzt diese ma nahmen f r raschere verfahren und zur belebung des wettbewerbs zu setzen
2995058 es gab schon nach regierungsbeginn sehr intensive diskussionsrunden gemeinsam mit dem justizministerium wir kamen aber dann ber den punkt rascher integration von kartellanwalt und bwb nicht hinaus im wirtschaftsministerium haben wir dann eine umfrage unter den europ ischen wettbewerbsbeh rden gestartet die antworten die wir aus 21 staaten bekommen haben zeigen dass wir uns diesbez glich in sterreich in einem aufholprozess befinden

2995062 wenn das alles an entlastung f r familien sein soll dann wei man was man von anderen wahlversprechen halten kann n mlich gar nichts
2995063 das bedeutet dass die 13 familienanpassung nicht einmal den verlust durch die inflation abdeckt
2995064 die gr ten ausgaben haben familien bei der kinderbetreuung deswegen braucht es einen gratiskindergarten
2995065 das w re eine massive entlastung aber das lehnt die vp offenbar aus puren ideologischen gr nden ab
2995066 mit dem 13 familienbeihilfenmonat wollen sie dar ber hinwegt uschen dass sie eine wirkliche entlastung ablehnen
2995067 man verspricht den familien wieder einmal etwas das letztlich einmal mehr am innerkoalition ren streit scheitern wird

2995139 we have heard from patients that one of their major concerns is the perceived
2995140 the draft nhs constitution will address this by making it explicit that patients have the right to nice approved drugs if clinically appropriate we will also speed up the national process for appraising new drugs and make more transparent and consistent the process for local funding of drugs not appraised by nice or where nice has yet to issue guidance

2995227 these actions have raised the costs of mortgage credit and reduced its availability
2995228 policy makers had been hoping they would move forward to provide more credit and now theyre just hoping they dont pull back

2995291 even the most optimistic proponent of ccs would not envisage any demonstration plant to be operational much before 2015 which would put wide scale deployment as far away as 2020 or later after lessons from the pilot have been learned and digested
2995292 we cannot emphasise strongly enough that the possibility of ccs should not be used as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2995293 replacing old coal fired power stations with new ones rather than using alternative energy sources locks britain in to a high level of emissions for many years to come
2995294 the eu ets is a mechanism designed to reduce emissions using it as a cover for choosing high emissions technology goes against the purpose of the scheme
2995295 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs is enormous
2995296 la universidad es un sistema social y cultural altamente complejo donde el pasado el presente y el futuro se conjugan una universidad del siglo xxi resume todo su pasado educativo cultural y cient fico y lo proyecta al futuro sin perder su esencia
2995297 cientos y cientos de tecnolog as son necesarias para el normal desarrollo y funcionamiento de cualquier sociedad moderna y el centro de esas tecnolog as se encuentra en conocimientos radicados exclusivamente en las universidades y no se hallan en ning n otro sitio que no sea la universidad
2995298 la universidad con todas sus falencias con todas sus imperfecciones con todos sus defectos
2995299 est en condiciones de cumplir no s lo con el rol de crear conservar y transmitir conocimiento que lo hace sino tambi n con ese otro m s importante el de servir de gran foro de debate para los grandes problemas nacionales el de ser la gran consultora de la naci n de la provincia de los municipios tanto para los problemas grandes como para los peque os y el mbito en el cual puedan discutirse las conveniencias las ventajas las desventajas lo aconsejable o no de tal o cual tecnolog a
2995300 lo que est en juego es la confianza de la sociedad y del estado en la educaci n superior como uno de los medios para promover el desarrollo humano fortalecer la identidad nacional y asegurar la autodeterminaci n
2995301 se requiere una nueva visi n que combine las exigencias de la universidad del aprendizaje superior con el imperativo de mayor pertinencia con el fin de responder a las expectativas de la sociedad en la que funciona esta visi n refuerza los principios de libertad acad mica y autonom a institucional y al mismo tiempo enfatiza la responsabilidad de la ense anza superior frente a la sociedad
2995302 educaci n para todos a lo largo de toda la vida
2995303 la universidad debe ser formadora de individuos capaces aptos para seguir mejorando por s mismos y para insertarse como elementos tiles y factores de superaci n en el tejido social
2995304 en 1960 el n mero de estudiantes universitarios en el mundo era de 13 millones y en 1995 hab a aumentado a 82 millones la multiplicaci n por seis en 35 a os muy importante si se lo compara con el del crecimiento de la poblaci n mundial en el mismo per odo lleva a que en 1995 los estudiantes universitarios constitu an el 16 2 de los j venes entre 18 y 22 a os que habitaban en el planeta
2995305 de acuerdo con lo anterior la poblaci n estudiantil a n podr a crecer considerablemente si todos los j venes con edad de cursar estudios terciarios efectivamente lo hicieran lo que aparece como cada vez m s necesario dado el proceso de creciente especializaci n del trabajo al que asisten las sociedades actualmente
2995306 el crecimiento acelerado del n mero de personas capaces de crear conocimiento es uno de los principales motores que impulsan la expansi n sostenida del ritmo de generaci n de nuevos conocimientos que hoy est transformando las sociedades
2995307 la mayor relevancia del conocimiento genera un contexto de nuevas demandas planteadas por las sociedades a las universidades
2995308 la primera es la demanda por acceder a la educaci n superior en efecto el futuro empleo salario oportunidades de todo tipo impone a los j venes la necesidad de avanzar en el sistema educativo formal todo lo que sea posible
2995309 la segunda es la demanda por recibir educaci n a lo largo de toda la vida quien hoy recibe un t tulo universitario sabe que si quiere permanecer activo en su actividad deber asistir peri dicamente a los mbitos universitarios para actualizar sus conocimientos y eventualmente desarrollar nuevas habilidades profesionales pues las adquiridas inicialmente habr n quedado obsoletas
2995310 la tercera es la demanda para que las instituciones de educaci n superior participen como actores destacados en los
2995311 la cuarta demanda alude a la afirmaci n de las identidades nacionales y regionales en un contexto en el cual las comunicaciones acent an como nunca antes la dimensi n mundial de los acontecimientos
2995312 debemos formar profesionales e investigadores para el ejercicio de su funci n de ciudadanos y a n m s de dirigentes natos de una sociedad que espera y necesita tanto la calidad de sus conocimientos t cnicos como la bondad de su concepci n tica pol tica o religiosa del mundo como dice antonio porchia quien no sabe creer no deber a saber
2995313 la universidad p blica no debe desarrollar s lo un proyecto acad mico debe constituirse como un proyecto socio pol tico que se centre en la formaci n de un recurso humano que se caracterice por tener capacidad de impulsar el cambio por asumir una actitud de liderazgo en ese cambio y por lograr consolidarse como un sector social que desde la reflexi n y la cr tica le aporte ideas y soluciones a los problemas sociales que signan nuestro pa s
2995314 la educaci n superior y otras instituciones y organizaciones acad micas representan un factor necesario en el desarrollo y la aplicaci n de estrategias y pol ticas de desarrollo
2995315 hace falta mucho m s energ a y trabajo para pasar de la incompetencia a la mediocridad que de un desempe o de primera categor a a la excelencia

2995317 la forma de organizaci n acad mica y de gobierno de la instituci n los valores y normas que transmite y la modalidad de su transmisi n y finalmente el impacto que ejerce y se propone ejercer sobre la sociedad a trav s de su acci n acad mica de docencia producci n cient fica servicios y transferencia y los ideales sociales y culturales que encarna y promueve son los aspectos a tener en cuenta para la construcci n del modelo de calidad y su evaluaci n porque es menester que exista pertinencia entre el marco referencial donde se desarrollan los programas universitarios y el abordaje que se hace desde su conceptualizaci n

2995322 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2995323 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2995324 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2995325 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2995326 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2995327 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2995328 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2995329 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2995330 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2995331 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2995332 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2995333 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2995334 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2995344 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2995345 i think hu jintao will put cross strait interests first because that serves beijings long term strategic benefit
2995346 on the diplomatic front i think beijing will try their best not to upset the taiwanese and send the wrong message
2995347 ma should not expose himself to this kind of open blackmail
2995348 beijing would shoot its own foot if it tries to steal another ally
2995349 its a nice game with the pressure off us and the manager says he wants a win so we are going to play our normal game and hope we get a result
2995350 if you look at our results from last season we dont do so well against the lesser teams as it were
2995351 but if you look at the record against the top teams we dont fear anyone
2995352 there will be a good crowd and its a good pitch so it should be a good game and we dont travel away for a draw we will go for all three points

2995354 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2995355 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

2995357 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2995358 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2995359 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2995360 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2995361 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2995362 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2995363 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2995364 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2995365 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2995366 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2995367 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2995368 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2995369 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2995370 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2995371 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2995372 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2995373 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2995374 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2995375 michael vick was just the beginning the dog fighting world is bigger and sicker than you can imagine meet the man who wants to wipe it out for good
2995376 in his job as manager of the humane society of the united states animal fighting campaign nothing so far has deterred goodwin from his crusade to put the countrys leading dog and cock fighters out of business
2995377 though dogfighting has been illegal in most states for ages until recently most local officials didnt take the crime seriously and dogfighters grew accustomed to operating under the radar
2995378 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2995379 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2995380 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2995381 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2995382 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2995383 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2995384 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2995385 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2995386 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2995387 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2995388 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2995389 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2995390 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2995391 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2995392 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2995393 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2995394 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2995395 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2995396 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2995397 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2995398 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2995399 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2995400 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2995401 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2995402 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2995403 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2995404 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2995405 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2995406 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2995407 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

2995437 oh you should have updated the abc report not the xyz report
2995438 yes we absolutely have to have this data available 24 hours a day with no down time on the weekends
2995439 what if i told you that we would have to buy double the hardware at a price tag of 50 000 to keep the data up over the weekend since normal backups require 2 4 hours of down time per week
2995440 so youre saying that we would pay 50 000 extra to cover a weekend downtime window
2995441 yes because the system would normally be available 24 7 m f but we cant guarantee uptime over the weekend unless we buy a backup set of hardware
2995442 ok monday friday 24 7 is the must have requirement the rest is nice to have
2995443 if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily at this stage it seems uncertain that they will stop
2995444 i just hope but i have no high expectations that the international community will be able to stop the russians at this stage i dont think anyone can say with certainty what their objectives are will they stop with south ossetia and abkhazia
2995445 its payback time by the russians for what the west did in kosovo the russians are in a very strong position what we have to try to do as western countries is impose some form of consequence on russia
2995446 i believe the georgians were suckered into this and paid a very heavy price
2995447 it was not an unreasonable calculation to go for a rapid win but in the end it was a miscalculation
2995448 the capital tskhinvali is relatively small no more than around 25 000 people and they probably thought they could just take it and be done
2995449 its a region thats not a viable state its delusional for the south ossetians to think they could be independent
2995450 if it hadnt been for the russian intervention then the separatists would have been rolled over very quickly they wouldnt have had a prayer
2995451 some south ossetians would have fled but most probably it would have been okay and south ossetia probably would have been better off economically and culturally
2995452 as it is now they are looking at being a small outpost on the southern reaches of russia
2995453 this is not and was never about south ossetia south ossetia is a place where russia found a pretext for military aggression against georgia
2995454 georgia was made an example of concerning the cost of standing up to russia and developing a country independently and thinking to join euro atlantic institutions
2995455 its basically the putin doctrine restoring russian control over the former soviet union irrespective of what those countries want which is why this is so reminiscent of the episodes in prague in 1968 and budapest in 1956
2995456 its a return to the spheres of influence and an attempt to undermine the entire building of the european zone of prosperity and security this is the biggest thing to happen in europe at least since the balkan wars and it might have much larger implications
2995457 the only way to reduce tensions is to have an extremely strong response
2995458 both georgia and russia have been much less cautious than the market had expected this has developed in quite an unexpected way its very hard to make any calls right now on how the war situation will develop or how it will impact emerging markets
2995459 obviously there has been a significant impact on russian assets
2995460 obviously people will also be looking at the baltics ukraine the former soviet republics with borders with russia
2995461 the big difference is that you do not have any particular disputed border regions except for a very small area of estonia or areas of any particular areas with a large russian population
2995462 i think saakashvili knew from the very beginning that russia would invade ossetia after georgian troops were sent there saakashvili did that on purpose and wanted to show the world what russia is like today
2995463 saakashvili is playing his media game for the conscience of the western world the price is high but he is very convincing
2995464 this will distance georgias nato membership in the formal terms but in practice in the geopolitical sense this is strengthening georgias nato perspective
2995465 the kremlin must understand that it is making a dramatic mistake by using force in georgia for the first time since 1991 in a post soviet neighbourhood and the international community must consistently explain that to russia
2995466 i still believe the fighting will stop quite quickly because the long term interests remain the same for georgia this is not to resolve the situation by force and for russia basically not to resolve it at all
2995467 i think the tempers will cool and the parties will sit down at the negotiating table and basically return the situation where it was before this conflict
2995468 the disproportion of the forces is so big that the war does not have much sense and basically it is not in either sides interest to continue
2995469 well arent there a maximum number of resources that can work on a boat at one time
2995470 that customer is never going to accept the cutting corners of a less complex boat
2995471 what does this logic have to do with the real world anyway
2995472 how can one do calculus with nilpotent infinitesimals an introduction to smooth infinitesimal analysis
2995473 i was very firm with vladimir putin in beijing on friday he and i have got a good relationship just as i was firm with the russian president

2995477 somewhere in one of martin buber s vignettes of the 18th 19th century hasidic masters i once read the quote that it is no small thing to cheer a man
2995478 i was reading over my husbands shoulder early this morning and we both kept exclaiming yes
2995479 its the one tournament i base my year around so i hope i can play well here
2995480 it would mean as much as winning a grand slam ive won so many grand slams and the olympics only comes around every four years i love playing for my country so this is a great start
2995481 for sure hes one of the best players in the world
2995482 but he is not playing all the time so for that reason his ranking is not in the top positions
2995483 i felt like i should have today off but it was a good practice i wanted to go to the market today but we have to play so many matches 14 matches singles and doubles in six days so its tough
2995484 it means we have to find an alternative source for those funds weve requested a meeting with the state to see what options we have
2995485 unfortunately bureacracy doesnt always give you the results you want
2995486 but my agency and frank gunions agency the berlin community development corporation are committed to making this happen if we have to bang on doors thats what well do

2995495 thats going to take time as soon as one starts getting more reps than the other than well officially know right now we get an even amount
2995496 its a matter of coming out here everyday and competing i thought i did that pretty decent today
2995497 were still rough we have to help them by protecting better that scrimmage wasnt as good as giving them a good clean look as to what was going on downfield
2995498 we know if we have a season where were plus 10 11 12 or something its going to be really hard to beat us
2995499 and when youre not there its a little harder to win were hoping we can be great at it whether we are or not i dont know well find out
2995500 they were driving to score those were big turns in the game
2995501 this is how we do it around here its all about the ball

2995504 i believe that every american has the right to affordable health care i believe that the millions of americans who cant take their children to a doctor when they get sick have that right we now face an opportunity and an obligation to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterdays health care debates its time to bring together businesses the medical community and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis and its time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while theyll get a seat at the table they dont get to buy every chair

2995507 the initiation of this validation study is an integral part of the commercialization roadmap for our diagnostic tests as we advance them towards use in a clinical setting
2995508 we believe the initiation of this study for our cup assay with a leading cancer research center such as m d anderson attests to the critical unmet need this test addresses
2995509 the current gold standard diagnostic evaluation for cup consists of a careful history and physical examination laboratory tests imaging studies invasive studies when necessary and thorough pathologic evaluation this process is lengthy and exposes the patient to unnecessary toxicities
2995510 rosetta genomics microrna based cup assay may present an alternative test to current diagnostic practices this study aims to validate their assay as well as compare its performance with current tests for cup

2995521 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2995522 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2995523 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2995524 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2995525 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2995526 it was fun he made it a pleasure to come to work he was amazing its the worlds loss and heavens gain he was an incredible man he was charming he was charismatic he was social he was professional he was amazing
2995527 you would think that he would live forever he just had that spirit he had that energy he seemed like a man who could conquer anything he endured his career to this point and got the success he deserved
2995528 more gentle absolutely more gentle he took his time with everyone which is something that when you get to a certain place in this business people dont really do
2995529 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2995530 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2995531 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2995532 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2995533 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2995534 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2995535 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2995536 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family

2995546 the world banks lending record does not match up to zoellicks rhetoric
2995547 the institution is simply not slowing down its significant funding to fossil fuel projects that will emit greenhouse gases for 20 to 40 years
2995548 the mission of the world bank group is to alleviate poverty and one way it does that is to increase access to energy
2995549 the oil industry certainly does not need soft loans from a multilateral poverty reduction agency
2995550 the private sector can do this perfectly well on its own
2995551 the world bank has become very dependent on fossil fuel loans in order to maintain its own financial strength
2995552 the eu views china still largely through the trade prism
2995553 we call them a strategic partner but we mostly talk to them about bras and shoes and the exchange rate of the renminbi
2995554 what should worry us is not the success of the developing world but its potential failure
2995555 a stalling or a crash of growth in china would be a disaster not just for china but for us too

2995558 the ocean is a genetically distinct environment and the single most diverse source of new molecules to be discovered
2995559 i think theres a lot of hype around the area
2995560 i think we have to be very careful about saying theres a whole new revolutionary period ahead with stem cells embryonic stem cells
2995561 i think in many ways whats going to happen is going to be much more modest so that stem cells will be used for trialling or testing out toxicity of drugs for example
2995562 firstflight and new world jet share the same values and both companies have excellent reputations in the industry
2995563 as a combined team we intend to continue to provide our clients with the same high level of service while offering the benefits we expect to derive from economies of scale although we will be making a number of internal organizational changes as we combine our companies it is our goal to make certain that the only changes our customers will experience are positive we also intend to maintain the working relationship new world jet has established with jet aviation and other industry contacts
2995564 over the next six to twelve months we will work closely with new world jet personnel to transition aircraft and identify the best and most efficient allocation of resources the closing of our acquisition of new world jet is a major step in firstflights recent growth initiatives and increases our presence in strategic markets we expect the new world transaction to be accretive to earnings within the next few quarters
2995565 the price increase reflects recent increases in paper and other raw material costs
2995566 a vehicles ride and handling performance are among the top influencers in consumer buying decisions
2995567 tennecos reputation for helping vehicle manufacturers deliver enhanced ride and handling has driven greater demand for high performance suspension systems like our electronic ces shock absorbers
2995568 products of this nature are very well received in the european markets and although this has been an expensive project i expect a substantial amount of business to be quickly generated
2995569 whilst demand for our total talent solutions continues to break records it is particularly pleasing to see our cross selling strategy achieving such notable successes with three of europes most respected enterprises stepstone now helps more than half of the dax 30 list of leading german companies manage talent and recruitment this is a strong endorsement of our solutions strategy and a telling indication of the sustained appetite for total talent management across europe

2995590 not going to grow as much as expected but its still going to be growing more than other media
2995591 advertisers have pulled back in a pretty meaningful way and display is feeling the brunt of it
2995592 macroeconomic weakness in the u s and its impact on advertising spending
2995593 continued to experience softness in display advertising from several of our largest financial advertisers
2995594 the old model of advertising you create something and buy the space to put it in just isnt working
2995595 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
2995596 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2995597 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
2995598 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2995599 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
2995600 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
2995601 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2995602 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2995603 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2995604 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2995605 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2995606 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2995607 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action

2995617 yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them this audit shows that the exceptional cases process is in chaos and patients are suffering in the last 20 months 5 000 cancer patients have been forced to plead for their lives there has to be a better way we urge the government to end this bizarre and demeaning lottery
2995618 we have heard from patients that one of their major concerns is the perceived
2995619 the draft nhs constitution will address this by making it explicit that patients have the right to nice approved drugs if clinically appropriate we will also speed up the national process for appraising new drugs and make more transparent and consistent the process for local funding of drugs not appraised by nice or where nice has yet to issue guidance

2995624 extreme gamers reportedly constitute 3 percent of the 174 million gamer who play games on a pc mac or console i e 5 2 million greater than the individual populations of los angeles chicago and houston or the populations of philadelphia phoenix san antonio and san diego combined
2995625 although extreme gamers are heavily involved with the industry they represent a small portion of the potential market for any new game that comes to market
2995626 in order to promote continued growth we must better understand all of the gaming segments
2995627 obviously i am disappointed with the result there are a lot of positives to take out of that being 2 0 up you want to go on and win it but i was pleased with our shape and how we played
2995628 we looked in control in the first half in the second half they brought on jason lee and he was always going to win lots of headers and cause problems
2995629 the only disappointing thing was we had enough chances at 2 1 to put the game to bed really they got a freak goal to put them back in the match a cross that went in the top corner there is not a lot we could do about that we still had a few one on ones and if we had converted one of them then it would have been over

2995729 the largest account at the bank of england is that of the english government and probably there has never been any account of which it was so easy in time of peace to calculate the course all the material facts relative to the english revenue and the english expenditure are exceedingly well known and the amount of the coming payments to and from this account are always except in war times to be calculated with wonderful accuracy in war no doubt this is all reversed the account of a government at war is probably the most uncertain of all accounts especially of a government of a scattered empire like the english whose places of outlay in time of war are so many and so distant and the amount of whose payments is therefore so incalculable
2995730 these largest ordinary payments of the government are the dividends on the debt and these are mostly made to bankers who act as agents for the creditors of the nation the payment of the dividends for the government is therefore in great part a transfer from the account of the government to the accounts of the various bankers a certain amount no doubt goes almost at once to the non banking classes to those who keep coin and notes in house and have no account at any bank but even this amount is calculable for it is always nearly the same and the entire operation is to those who can watch it singularly invariable time after time
2995731 why should a bank keep any reserve because it may be called on to pay certain liabilities at once and in a moment why does any bank publish an account in order to satisfy the public that it possesses cash or available securities enough to meet its liabilities the object of publishing the account of the banking department of the bank of england is to let the nation see how the national reserve of cash stands to assure the public that there is enough and more than enough to meet not only all probable calls but all calls of which there can be a chance of reasonable apprehension and there is no doubt that the publication of the bank account gives more stability to the money market than any other kind of precaution would give
2995732 i can only reply that i propose to retain this system because i am quite sure that it is of no manner of use proposing to alter it a system of credit which has slowly grown up as years went on which has suited itself to the course of business which has forced itself on the habits of men will not be altered because theorists disapprove of it or because books are written against it you might as well or better try to alter the english monarchy and substitute a republic as to alter the present constitution of the english money market founded on the bank of england and substitute for it a system in which each bank shall keep its own reserve there is no force to be found adequate to so vast a reconstruction and so vast a destructions and therefore it is useless proposing them
2995733 by the last return the savings banks the old and the post office together contain about 60 000 000 l of deposits and against this they hold in the funds securities of the best kind but they hold no cash whatever they have of course the petty cash about the various branches necessary for daily work but of cash in ultimate reserve cash in reserve against a panic the savings banks have not a sixpence these banks depend on being able in a panic to realise their securities but it has been shown over and over again that in a panic such securities can only be realised by the help of the bank of england that it is only the bank with the ultimate cash reserve which has at such moments any new money or any power to lend and act if in a general panic there were a run on the savings banks those banks could not sell 100 000 l of consols without the help of the bank of england not holding themselves a cash reserve for times of panic they are entirely dependent on the one bank which does hold that reserve
2995734 the following is a comparison of the liabilities to the public and of the cash reserve of the banking systems of the united kingdom france germany and the united states

2995824 this is a great day for american airlines american eagle and susan g komen for the cure
2995825 but most of all its a great day for all of us who are deeply determined to end breast cancer forever we sincerely thank the american airlines employees at our tulsa and abilene maintenance bases who donated their time to carefully wrap these aircraft in the ribbons seeing these special aircraft take flight today is an inspiration to us all
2995826 this partnership speaks volumes about the quality and longevity of americans commitment to komen and the way the company and its employees share our sense of urgency in discovering and delivering the cures and finding ways to prevent breast cancer
2995827 we are also thrilled that american airlines will be the first corporation to have a direct hand in writing a significant chapter in breast cancer research history with its promise grant
2995828 while tremendous strides have been made in the overall treatment of breast cancer until now theres been very little research into this rare disease that behaves so differently than other breast cancers
2995829 the global cancer community will stand to benefit from our comprehensive research program and what we learn about this disease the only way to achieve better outcomes for women with the disease is to have dedicated resources such as the funds allocated by komen and american airlines for continued ibc research
2995830 we are conducting air strikes close air support to our ground forces our forces are inching in towards the different barangays villages with the objective of clearing them
2995831 i dont believe for one second that apart from rex any of them really dont care about the money so i said if you really dont care about the money why dont the final five all agree to split it
2995832 you could get 20 000 each but then the winner would have to give up 80 000 and they all said no so they obviously do care about the money
2995833 i had done some minor investigative stuff earlier but i managed to really make my mark with the 2004 election
2995834 my reporting took off based on my skill set with database research thats what was called upon to analyze computer records in the election
2995835 eventually people began to find me and send confidential information
2995836 they trusted me to tell the story better than professional journalists the stuff i had dug up went into the trial about the election
2995837 i think sound politics has a diversity of opinion that you dont get from many newspapers
2995838 i have a blend of original reporting commentary and snark were a loosely based collective everyone has his or her own style and interests id say thats partly why were successful
2995839 i spent a lot of time blogging but it was time to move on
2995840 the opportunity costs were too great i needed to earn a living
2995841 even though this is a left of center area in politics overall there certainly is a market for a more conservative point of view
2995842 i believe our regular readership extends well outside of seattle encompassing the broader puget sound area and to some degree the whole state moreover quality and or entertaining writing seems to have its own draw
2995843 when i started out in 2004 i couldnt get a party official to return my call now theyre inviting me to the dncc
2995844 im simply a damn good read something even many of my righty critics will admit
2995845 ha is the only local liberal blog thats built on muckraking ive always been the go to blogger for dishing the dirt people like dirt
2995846 i want to have fun with politics yet i also want to get stuff done
2995847 i want to be edgy outspoken and occasionally foul mouthed and yet i want to maintain my credibility with stuffy politicos and even stuffier editorial boards sometimes wonkish sometimes satirical but always truthful ha is an opportunity to speak my mind while enjoying the delusion that others actually care what i have to say it is pure unadulterated me
2995848 one of the comments i occasionally get is something along the lines that profanity is a last resort of people who are otherwise incapable of expressing themselves which is of course a load of shit
2995849 in fact this critique itself is nothing more than a crutch for those who cant refute me theyre essentially saying look see goldy curses so you can dismiss everything he said thats just lazy rhetoric on their part these are words powerful words and like all my words i choose them very carefully im a writer
2995850 i was happy to play my part once cast in it
2995851 you know reporters if theres a conservative blogger there has to be a liberal blogger to balance him out and because the capital press corps was already familiar with me i was the obvious choice stefan also stupidly got into a pissing match with me again upping my profile and increasing my traffic so i thank him
2995852 i wouldnt say goldstein and i are buddies either but weve had pleasant conversations together i even went to
2995853 i know there are folks at the times who think i have a chip on my shoulder but if i do it is because i resent the fact that they so blithely dismiss me when i am at least as good a writer and political analyst as any columnist or editorialist on their staff
2995854 perhaps instead of bemoaning the changing media environment and blaming the internet for undermining their business model they should re examine the quality of their own content and consider the possibility that they might stem the steady decline in their readership if only they offered a more compelling product
2995855 we know what a tremendous inconvenience it is and were working tirelessly at this point to get the situation resolved
2995856 it appears that the more that obama speaks the more afraid folks in south carolina get
2995857 we are seeing die hard democrats tell us that obama is not their man
2995858 people who may have been apprehensive about mccain now see this race as potentially winnable
2995859 you never know bad things can happen at conventions and democrats need to be careful that hillary doesnt somehow ultimately cause some sort of acrimony at the convention among her supporters or makes obama look like a weaker nominee
2995860 people are getting more enthusiastic about mccain because he is getting more aggressive toward obama which makes republicans and conservatives believe mccain actually can win
2995861 we hear people saying mccain may not have been my guy but we cant afford obama
2995862 although the interest in mccain is only tepid we are very excited about our prospects for many local elections that we thought 60 days ago would be very difficult
2995863 mccain is attracting independents and hillary democrats the more time he spends in nevada the more people like him its a small state and easy to reach out to voters
2995864 bad times could be good for mccain if anger helps democrats fear advantages republicans
2995865 where have you gone ross perot bill clinton the lone two term democratic president since fdr wouldnt have been elected if independent ross perot hadnt siphoned 19 percent of the vote in 1992 former georgia rep bob barr staging an indie bid from mccains right has little cash and doesnt seem to be a factor in competitive states
2995866 the legacy of lbj jimmy and bubba barack obama would have been a trailblazer no matter what but the democrats trail to the white house has been remarkably narrow since 1960 accommodating only southern whites with border state strength lyndon johnson jimmy carter and bill clinton
2995867 americans may want divided government some democratic operatives think a possible landslide for their party in congressional races could backfire on obama
2995868 it appears that the more that obama speaks the more afraid folks in south carolina get
2995869 we are seeing die hard democrats tell us that obama is not their man
2995870 people who may have been apprehensive about mccain now see this race as potentially winnable
2995871 you never know bad things can happen at conventions and democrats need to be careful that hillary doesnt somehow ultimately cause some sort of acrimony at the convention among her supporters or makes obama look like a weaker nominee
2995872 people are getting more enthusiastic about mccain because he is getting more aggressive toward obama which makes republicans and conservatives believe mccain actually can win
2995873 we hear people saying mccain may not have been my guy but we cant afford obama
2995874 although the interest in mccain is only tepid we are very excited about our prospects for many local elections that we thought 60 days ago would be very difficult
2995875 mccain is attracting independents and hillary democrats the more time he spends in nevada the more people like him its a small state and easy to reach out to voters
2995876 multicultural markets have been showing growth over the past few years in an automotive market that has been in decline
2995877 the u s census bureau projects that hispanics african americans and asians will comprise 33 2 percent of the u s population by 2010 and 36 7 percent by 2020
2995878 automotive manufacturers cannot afford to ignore the growing importance of multicultural markets including paying close attention to their loyalty
2995879 many manufacturers are already increasing their focus on marketing and connecting with these markets through non traditional avenues like scholarships and supporting community activities
2995880 its important for oems and their supporting agencies to measure the performance of these programs against their marketing goals
2995881 this study identifies superior leadership based on the success of hospital executive teams long term strategies for strengthening performance
2995882 these are true good to great leadership teams that have focused on improving quality efficiency use of evidence based medicine and financial stability in order to better serve their patients and communities
2995883 given these findings it is clear that healthcare executives are facing great challenges in aligning their organizations for continuous performance improvement
2995884 the hospitals that accomplish this feat are well deserving of this award
2995885 oh weve already tried to deliver this here have it back

2995887 world art vision is a chance for individual artists to exhibit their most recent work but it is also an opportunity to meet with the other artists present and attend the exciting program of collateral events and conferences which are being organized and of course to meet with the public visitors collectors and critics
2995888 this is a marvellous opportunity for artists to meet with each other with the public and potential buyers cancun being a resort with extremely high level tourism and trade and we are extremely grateful for the encouragement and for the support given by the ayuntamiento benito juarez cancun and the state of quintana roo in the organisation of this event

2995900 nrp had a record setting quarter attributed to both increases in our royalty revenue per ton and production
2995901 the coal industry is experiencing the most robust coal market in history with metallurgical coal prices nearly tripling and appalachian and illinois basin steam coal prices having more than doubled since year end because our coal royalties are based on a percentage of the sales price received by our lessees we have experienced all the positives of the current pricing market without having to bear the burdens of escalating mining costs as a result our increased royalty per ton is directly correlated to the increased prices in fact the vast majority of our revenue is leveraged to sales price

2995909 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2995910 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2995911 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2995912 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2995913 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2995914 este pacat ca unii dintre partenerii nostri nu ne ajuta si chiar incearca sa ne deranjeze si ma refer aici in special la deplasarea contingentului militar georgian din irak in zona de conflict cu ajutorul statelor unite folosind avioane americane de transport
2995915 adevarata masura a acestei atitudini cinice este uluitoare sa incerci sa transformi albul in negru negrul in alb si sa prezinti victimele agresiunii drept agresori sa plasezi responsabilitatea pentru consecintele agresiunii pe umerii victimelor
2995916 adevarata masura a acestei atitudini cinice este uluitoare sa incerci sa transformi albul in negru negrul in alb si sa prezinti victimele agresiunii drept agresori sa plasezi responsabilitatea pentru consecintele agresiunii pe umerii victimelor
2995917 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2995918 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2995919 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2995931 they are all behind me willing to support me in the fight i am going through
2995932 it is not unusual for someone to delay getting treatment for several weeks or several months
2995933 im not advocating that everybody wait a period of three or four weeks if they do it under medical supervision it can be very safe
2995934 a lot of times when you get to an event like the olympic games you can put too much pressure on yourself
2995935 if i show up and swim the race i am capable of
2995936 to know i will be cured and i will beat this is inspiring
2995937 its not going to get in the way of my life
2995938 hip hop on the internet is really based on beef and a bad history

2995947 this young man named barack obama got one of those tickets and came over to this country
2995948 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born so dont tell me i dont have a claim on selma alabama dont tell me im not coming home to selma alabama im here because somebody marched im here because you all sacrificed for me i stand on the shoulders of giants

2995982 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
2995983 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
2995984 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
2995985 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight

2996442 can a person be a good businessman but a lousy economist yes take t boone pickens for example hes all over television touting his plan for wind power as a substitute for foreign oil a plan that calls for massive government subsidies this should immediately make us suspicious if wind is so good why does it need subsidies
2996443 the fbis total failure to point to a shred of evidence placing ivins in new jersey on either of the two days the anthrax letters were sent is a very conspicuous deficiency in its case its possible that ivins was able to travel to princeton on two occasions in three weeks without leaving the slightest trace of having done so not a credit card purchase atm withdrawal unusual gas purchases nothing but that relies on a depiction of ivins as a cunning and extremely foresightful criminal an image squarely at odds with most of the fbis circumstantial evidence that suggests ivins was actually quite careless even reckless in how he perpetrated this crime
2996444 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist
2996445 be not righteous overmuch neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou die before thy time
2996446 there is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved
2996447 i think its inevitable that there will be a lower standard of living than what everybody had always anticipated
2996448 remind me never to get this guy mad at me
2996449 a indiqu quelle ne participerait probablement pas la convention d mocrate
2996450 it is a poor result which has come as a result of not following the type of play we want to see and players deciding it is all too easy and playing how they wanted to
2996451 what if we discover half way through that we dont have the right strategy
2996452 when members of congress from your state return home this summer they need to hear why stopping further media consolidation must be a top priority by acting now you can ensure that there are thousands of petitions ready to be delivered when your u s representative sets foot back in your district for the summer congressional recess
2996453 i believe more fervently than ever that as journalism goes so goes democracy
2996454 yet as mergers and buyouts change both old and new media bringing a frenzied focus on cost cutting while fattening the pockets of both the new owners and their investors we are seeing journalism degraded through the layoffs and buyouts of legions of reporters and editors
2996455 he told his journalists that he didnt have an editorial agenda or a perspective about newspapers roles as civic institutions
2996456 im a businessman he said all that matters in the end is the bottom line just this week zell told wall street analysts that to save money he intends to eliminate 500 pages of news a week across all of the companys 12 papers that could mean eliminating some 82 pages a week just from the los angeles times what will he use to replace reporters and editors he says to the wall street analysts ill use maps graphics lists rankings and stats it sounds to me as if sam has confused viagra with lunesta
2996457 he insults journalists and journalism at virtually every whistle stop on his tour
2996458 he says its not about about profits the american public and policy makers have to decide whether journalism is produced purely for the reaping of profit or if its a central component to a functioning participatory democracy
2996459 you make policy accordingly there is no such thing as a deregulated media policy system the only question is will the media be regulated for the largest media corporations or regulated on behalf of the american public thats what all of our anticonsolidation efforts are about
2996460 on the brink of the greatest opportunity in generations to break the corporate media stranglehold on democracy
2996461 the future will go down one of two paths the first is the righteous path its of openness a new media world that treats all content equally the second path is a closed internet an internet that looks like radio tv or cable an internet where giant phone and cable companies decide whats on how much it costs and how fast it downloads an internet that is no longer a vibrant town square for all of us but a cash cow for a few
2996462 we dedicate ourselves here today to the proposition that our fight for a democratic open internet and independent media will end the historic pattern of monopoly that suffocates freedom dissent and creativity
2996463 they paid too much theyre overleveraged theres too much debt
2996464 weve been willing to bargain concessions where necessary but we think the biggest mistake is that the owners and the publishers have not been talking to the frontline workers about that kind of innovation so what were trying to do where we have to do concessions we want to trade that for real involvement real committees that are able to work on a better business model on the future of the product we still believe that theres a place for quality journalism that people will want it
2996465 were hearing that tribune company is going to save journalism through all these cuts
2996466 thats not what were seeing thats not what were feeling were feeling that basically its just a self fulfilling cycle of a downward spiral
2996467 the overwhelming majority of stories are broken by professional journalists not by bloggers or armchair amateurs
2996468 advertisers have already aggressively seized the new online world to go back into the programming business themselves creating whats called branded content imagine the camel news caravan revived but this time as a sponsored youtube channel can you imagine advertisers going for stories with key words such as health care reform environmental degradation iraqi casualties i dont think so so what will happen to news in the future as the already tattered boundary between journalism and advertising is dispensed with entirely and as content programming commerce and online communities are rolled into one profitably attractive package
2996469 the large newspapers are dying and the internet is not going to replace them
2996470 part of it is ownership part of it is just the antiquated nature of newsprint as a conveyor of information
2996471 its not totally about ownership it is about the medium itself the average reader of the paper copy of the new york times spends 45 minutes reading the paper the average viewer of the new york times web site spends about 7 minutes the internet is not designed for a literate society we are moving into a postliterate society
2996472 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2996473 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2996474 i dont think any budweiser drinking joe sixpack wants to become a stella artois drinking joep zespak nor do i think his loyalties will translate into dutch that easily either
2996475 a truly american mass market beer company could tap into pun fully intended the national pride we would feel from seeing american workers actually producing something other than a powerpoint slide deck homer simpson once called beer the cause of and solution to all of lifes problems just as i believe that the sale of anheuser busch is an indication of all that is wrong with our economy perhaps the innovation national pride and jobs that would come with the creation of a true american macrobrew can demonstrate whats right
2996476 there is no reason that he should resign everything they are saying is false so why should he resign
2996477 the work of the impeachment committee is almost complete it is giving finishing touches to the charge sheet
2996478 we gave him a chance to resign we gave him a few months but we have come to the conclusion that now the people of pakistan through their elected representatives in the parliament will have to do that
2996479 first the provincial assemblies will pass resolutions calling for musharraf to quit and this will happen during this week
2996480 any democrat would be voting on the right side of history we do not need horse trading
2996481 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important
2996482 obvious judicial interference and double standards caused me and my family to receive no justice what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
2996483 the panel judge has found that the two defendants are not returning to thailand or presenting themselves to the court by the deadline which violates their bail conditions
2996484 the court has decided to confiscate their bail money and issue arrest warrants for the two defendants
2996485 i expected everything would be better that i might have a chance to prove my innocence and receive a fair trial when i returned to thailand
2996486 if i have a chance i will come back to die on thai ground
2996487 the two sides agreed to continue negotiations in a constructive atmosphere
2996488 solana and jalili voiced satisfaction at the constructive trend of negotiations in geneva and the contacts afterwards
2996489 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
2996490 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
2996491 if you are on the enemys side or you are being used by enemies stop it it cannot just be unity in vain a hollow unity
2996492 it must be unity guided by basic principles principles that will solidify us strengthen us
2996493 zimbabwe is not for sale and zimbabwe will never be a colony again
2996494 when somebody makes you turn against each other you dont say we are no longer family members
2996495 fighting in self defence is not a sin so we fight to protect our legacy
2996496 congratulated all the parties to the negotiations for exhibiting this sense of collective and shared responsibility
2996497 we spent all night yesterday in discussions and some of the things that were holding back at times i nearly raised my fist but he remained cool
2996498 we are here to continue recovering natural resources and the consolidation of nationalization

2996508 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

2996519 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
2996520 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
2996521 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

2996543 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
2996544 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
2996545 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
2996546 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
2996547 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
2996548 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
2996549 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

2996619 the commercial marketplace has long faced challenges due to factors such as lack of automation in the applications and account review process as well as limited access to rich credit data
2996620 account advantage eliminates these challenges by providing access to unique data and sophisticated technology that enables companies to respond to market dynamics and make consistent business credit decisions across sales channels
2996621 until now companies had to choose between sophisticated products requiring long deployments and training and simplistic products that are easy to use
2996622 with aie version 1 2 we are extremely excited to present a unified information access platform that is truly sophisticated in its capabilities yet easy to install manage and scale our clients and partners keep telling us they can now do things they either could not do before or had simply abandoned because previous solutions took too long and were too costly to implement
2996623 solving the problem of unified access to multiple sources of information in many formats and languages is an urgent problem for enterprises
2996624 earlier solutions tried to turn content into data or vice versa but then the context of that information is lost far better to invent a new approach that combines the features of search and business intelligence and data warehousing in order to manage find merge analyze and report on all the information no matter where it comes from or what format it is in by offering a single architecture capable of handling both structured data and unstructured content attivio brings this fresh approach to the unified access market this new development may cause organizations to look differently at how they manage and utilize their data
2996625 aies performance scalability and simplicity allow our customers to get the system up and running quickly and avoid the traditional pitfalls of high infrastructure cost and lengthy implementations that are common with legacy solutions

2996871 the only reason to do it is to avoid reporting further losses in the financial statements
2996872 these are very high quality assets and all of them are paying principal or interest at the moment
2996873 it would take a lot to do that but theres a lot of bad news in the market right now
2996874 we never felt like we had to do it before because we didnt feel like we had the pricing dislocations before

2996883 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2996884 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2996885 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2996886 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2996887 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2996888 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2996889 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2996890 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2996899 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2996900 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2996901 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2996902 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2996903 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2996904 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2996905 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2996906 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist

2996912 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2996913 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2996914 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2996915 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2996916 you told me more about the process than i know
2996917 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2996918 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2996919 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2996920 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2996921 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2996922 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2996923 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2996924 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2996925 write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches to ephesus and to smyrna and to pergamum and to thyatira and to sardis and to philadelphia and to laodicea
2996926 these are the ones coming out of the great tribulation
2996927 therefore they are before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence 16 they shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore the sun shall not strike them nor any scorching heat 17 for the lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd and he will guide them to springs of living water and god will wipe away every tear from their eyes

2996930 we have a great tournament site that is very easy to get to
2996931 we are less than a tank of gas from quincy il and cedar rapids ia two areas we like to see teams draw from
2996932 we feel this years tournament will be the best yet
2996933 there will be tractors and tractor parts steam engines and parts and more recently we have gotten motorcycles
2996934 this is not your typical 3 on 3 basketball tournament the macker is a family basketball festival thats really youth oriented

2996940 lets just say i dont need a jeep cherokee but i could have bought one with what i spent on this anyway you see a lot more cherokees around than these
2996941 they would usually hide them here for a day and at night take them a days distance north so they could continue their travel to canada
2996942 when people come to the museums at midwest old threshers is a nice collection of the machines and the artifacts that relate to the early farming culture that we had and still do all over the midwest
2996943 its one of the best places i can think of to come and eat and look at exciting demonstrations to see some really unusual machines and other demonstrations that are available
2996944 was that pizza good i hope it was good because it was like a gazillion calories each and you had twenty pieces did you see what i ate a quarter of a walnut a raisin and i waved the cheese in front of my plate
2996945 facial tattooing is an vanessa hudgens at the 2008 teen choice awards
2996946 no one device offers the depth and breadth of entertainment that xbox 360 can deliver and we know consumers need increasingly more and more space to store the amazing digital entertainment content we provide
2996947 now the xbox 360 has triple the space to house all your entertainment needs at no extra cost

2996949 the next phase for khanya will be to concentrate on a more affordable model
2996950 multichoice believes various players in the industry should be encouraged to explore these technological opportunities we are hopeful that the licensing process for mobile tv will be expedited
2996951 actually very sensible and is excellent news for the industry multichoice is ready to go now
2996952 government is consciously avoiding the creation of another monopoly in the telecommunications market
2996953 the decision to allow more than one player means the market can flourish under the effects of high competition the mobile market is already a great example of this and the minister s decision will just enforce this frost amp sullivan expects existing media players to show an increased interest in mobile tv as a result of this announcement
2996954 the increased competition is expected to make the service more affordable and give consumers a choice in terms of the service
2996955 from a network operator perspective it gives them the opportunity to vary and differentiate their service offering and thus drive revenue growth be it via subscribers or advertising
2996956 the further implication of the u turn is that the doc is not applying itself rigorously enough to the issues at stake or is not being pragmatic enough in the guidance it takes from its advisers
2996957 the request for proposals that we will be issuing should be out in the next few weeks
2996958 all of our plans will for now remain in our focus areas which are the four metros where fibre optic cables are being laid
2996959 this would include the option of iptv services from a third party pay tv player along with closed circuit tv for security cameras
2996960 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
2996961 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram
2996962 they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men
2996963 i saw them slaughter a nine year old boy like a sheep because his family didnt pledge allegiance to them
2996964 shit youre lucky you dont smoke i smoke all day and dont cough like that
2996965 i recorded sampled cut and spliced over 100 tracks down into their most basic components i ended up with over 300 loops ranging in different lengths i started to recreate and reinterpret each track and then put the pieces back together as if an audio jigsaw puzzle using effects and edits as the glue between each piece
2996966 i dont like mix cds everyones being lazy so i gotta do something different

2996968 hawtin believes the whole dj thing is stuck in a groove
2996969 you get excited about the offense and the way smith ran the ball and you get worried about the defense giving up two big runs like that
2996970 offensively we started fast and made some plays i didnt really like the way the defense started out
2996971 there was a bunch of misalignments and a couple of missed assignments
2996972 i give myself an ok i know i can get a lot better in some areas like blocking
2996973 the offensive line did a fantastic job run blocking all day
2996974 when you give michael deanthony and chip gregory those kind of holes theyre going to make runs
2996975 we set the tempo in the second half but weve got to set the tempo earlier
2996976 we showed some fatigue and a lack of toughness at times and then we showed the ability to rush the passer at times
2996977 due to the increased level of extremist activity targeting individuals involved in biomedical research in recent months our first concern is for our employees and the animals we care for at
2996978 usda did open an inquiry when we filed a complaint
2996979 their statement about fears for their own safety is absurd
2996980 they have an abysmal record of animal care as usual they are more interested in their reputation than in the animals safety
2996981 that monkeys were literally cooked to death by a heating system failure as a whistleblower alleges shows that the facility did not even have a simple alarm system in place to alert staff to the malfunction
2996982 those devices for which the general controls by themselves are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness but for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls to provide such assurance including performance standards postmarket surveillance patient registries development and dissemination of guidelines recommendations and any other appropriate actions the agency deems necessary
2996983 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
2996984 with alcohol we acknowledge the distinction between use and abuse and we focus our law enforcement on efforts to stop irresponsible use we do not arrest or jail responsible drinkers that should be our policy for marijuana as well
2996985 an addictive drug which induces in its users insanity criminality and death
2996986 the perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction
2996987 not soon but eventually youll see the development of a marijuana futures market

2996990 come si fa a sopportare una cosa del genere penso a veltroni e dalema che vanno in barca in un mare di merda e che vanno ad incagliarsi addosso a rutelli che guarda mastella che fa il bagno nudo
2996991 come si fa a sopportare una cosa del genere penso a fiorello vestito in tut con polifemo che gli fa una cacata di 100 chili sulla testa e i sette nani che gli mordono le palle

2997000 for most other cis countries russia is their main strategic partner and they dont have any interest in seeing their relations be reduced with moscow in fact that would be very damaging for them so its in their interests to remain silent
2997001 we have information confirmed by our specialists that several vessels of the black sea fleet left sevastopol and either made their way or were making their way toward the territory of georgia
2997002 obviously if this is confirmed we will have to reconsider the conditions under which these vessels would be able to be stationed on the territory of ukraine
2997003 very concerned over the situation in south ossetia and expresses the hope that the sides will make efforts to find a peaceful solution to the disputed issues as soon as possible which will make it possible to restore stability and peace in our neighboring country
2997004 weve seen over the few years that putin was in power the restoration of russian power through the growing economy
2997005 and they have shown an increasing willingness to become involved in former soviet states in order to retain them within the russian sphere of influence and i think this really re certifies the fact that russia is really willing to become involved in armed conflict in order to retain influence over regions that it feels as part of its backyard so i think for most post soviet countries that is really a telling development

2997041 something really bizarre is happening in the skies over the u k
2997042 ive been dealing in sightings for 30 years and we currently have something very real which mankind cannot explain
2997043 i may have an artist one day my rosters full i couldnt release him i may call pain you got room on nappy boy records or call kardi whats up with black jays you got room the whole vision was for all of us to always have an outlet
2997044 not for sale thats why you got the bar code over the mouth
2997045 what that represents is all my words all my music my feelings energy and passion i put in the music thats something that couldnt be swayed by the amount of money that a label would pay me at the end of the day any music you hear associated with kardinal offishall is because it means something to me this album is dope because kon allowed me to put it out there and he didnt want me just to stay in a certain lane
2997046 we took rick ross the boss record and just turned it to rudebwoy its just another day in the life a of real ruuuuude bwoyyyy put some auto tune on there the beat was killer from the first time i heard it the way the horns come in and the beat just drops like a new school paul revere you already know anything t pain touches turns to platinum i take my favorite joints even if the rappers are my peoples and i try to do it better
2997047 this was the first official reunion we had since we did the grindin remix
2997048 its produced by my first producer i signed with he goes by the name of the boy wonder soon as me pusha and malice heard the joint we were like we must destroy this i had a joint before thats called swag with myself pusha and lil wayne but out of respect and honor to the clipse i wanted to have a joint where it was just me and the brothers its just us three going in hard
2997049 this mixtape in particular its produced by myself and clinton sparks
2997050 clinton is also down with the konvict family its all a family movement i have a lot of new fans since dangerous but they need to know my history i didnt just come out of nowhere and on the intro clinton produced a timeline of what happened in my life to where i am now
2997051 ive been doing an album with lil wayne its called t wayne the project its basically just going to be an array of things just a visual love the two artists youve seen collaborate with everyone except each other when you see us together its crazy right now we already have what weve done were gonna keep going till they tell us to stop we might even put out a mixtape weve got so many songs that we just might do a t wayne mixtape too
2997052 i think its about time for us to really focus on the music business side of the game
2997053 i think we been doing a lot of street oriented underground catering
2997054 we do what we do and always stay true thats just the chemistry of the clipse stay true to what we are
2997055 i think were gonna open up to a wider audience but keep our same fans too
2997056 if you set up the album in the sense of moods
2997057 i can get some of that soul and some of them drums from sean c and lv i can get some of those stories from j u s t i c e league i dont know what im going to get from dj khalil he has something crazy you can tell they are bringing their a game to it
2997058 you can always rely on the neptunes to come with that old school sound
2997059 everybody is damn near on everything its a platform to showcase everybody and their own individual movements i want this to be a diving board the clipse jump off sandman liva everybody springboard off the situation and keep going
2997060 we got a song called money thats a great club banger
2997061 i think it shows us in a different light partying and having fun but the way we do it its one of the greatest things when you get around cats whose talent level is so high you gotta bring your a game i know theyre gonna bring their a game its great chemistry

2997068 theres not a lot of appellate authority in the connecticut state courts to provide guidance on how the legal principles get applied
2997069 when we were sitting down i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call but tom went to me what are you on the phone for were in a competition and weve got another dive to do
2997070 that is just thomas being over nervous thats how it was today tom should not be worrying about what im doing today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that for me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform today
2997071 peking tom why everyones looking at this 14 year old darling diver
2997072 i think it the publicity is the sole reason it went the way it did today to be honest im not disappointed with my performance at all i landed on my head on every single dive which is what my aim was
2997073 i could have dived better but it was hard work for me today tom was very very nervous more so than ever before and i think he really struggled to get through the competition
2997074 i knew we were capable of a medal going into these olympic games but i knew that it would depend on how tom performed in a synchro team you have to be on the top of your game both at the same time and today that didnt happen
2997075 i wasnt on the top of my game but i out dived thomas today and thats not something that normally happens that to me is because tom had a lot more pressure on him than i did
2997076 we obviously didnt dive very well it was disappointing but it was a great experience and i really enjoyed myself and had so much fun out there thats all you can ask for getting the experience
2997077 this was all about getting experience for 2012 as ive always said and now ive got rid of all the cobwebs i can go into the individual event with more confidence
2997078 we prepared for it like a normal competition but it just wasnt our day today we put 100 per cent effort into every dive we did but we just didnt pull it off
2997079 oh god oh dylan it must be cold down there it is cold enough on top in november the dirtiest month of the year that killed you on the ninth vile day if only i could take you a bowl of your bread and milk and salt that you always drank at night to warm you up

2997125 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
2997126 the best part of raw was mike adamle people who criticize this guy need to
2997127 when i came up and seen this i thought oh my god its ridiculous
2997128 if we go ahead and do it ourselves then we might get in trouble for it they have a committee thats supposed to do this stuff were willing to help
2997129 when i was little i used to come up here a lot because it was so nice and so peaceful it was beautiful now im devastated
2997130 theres a plan to do this but as you know the church has no money its got to be volunteer work and usually its the people whove got someone in the cemetery who volunteer im heavily involved in the cemetery on pleasant street because i got people belong to me buried there
2997131 the plan is to make it as presentable as possible as quickly as possible with the least amount of money as possible
2997132 were having some problems there trying to get enough free labor to get it done everything is all volunteer but were working on it its probably going to be the first of september now everybodys gone during the summer the ministers even gone and left us we got a job to get the grass cut in the other ones
2997133 were an up and coming community were a prosperous community compared to some what an image to portray
2997134 council wanted it done as quickly as possible and we had the opportunity this morning with the machine
2997135 were looking for more financial support and a recognition from the town
2997136 i do understand there are a lot of groups looking for support but if you saw our statistics there are a lot of people using the library
2997137 their presentation was an excellent one and their request is certainly justifiable
2997138 but we will have to consider it along with all of the other things
2997139 theres no formula and its entirely at the discretion of the town council

2997142 when we overflow in our emergency department we look to other facilities to see if they can accommodate our needs rather than trying to care for those patients in the emergency department
2997143 we transfer people quite frequently it depends on our bed situation and how busy our emergency department is while it is safe to have a couple of intensive care patients in the emergency department when it gets too busy we have to look to other facilities
2997144 a couple of weekends ago we had some unexpected leave at the last minute among nursing staff and there was no relief staff available
2997145 weve been tight on staff this summer as most places have been because were trying to give nurses leave and when we start to have overcapacity like we did last week were concerned because that means we need extra staff we cannot manage as well as if we had extra staff
2997146 when our patient volumes go up we look at it very closely and try to act very quickly so we dont get into a situation where we cant provide the care
2997147 they have been filled to capacity and beyond capacity for months
2997148 some of these issues are beyond the control of clarenville management or eastern health
2997149 sometimes the employer isnt the bad guy they just dont have a lot to work with thats the cards theyre dealt and government holds a lot of those cards

2997151 i think its a crisis for the nurse because they are being put in a situation where they have to make critical decisions when they are tired

2997215 our goal is for all people regardless of gender sexuality ethnicity or other such things to have the freedom to create their own identity and be respected for their personal qualities
2997216 many parents feel forced to change he to she or she to he and other details as they read stories for their children because so many details in childrens books are so very traditional
2997217 based on prejudice or traditional gender roles that rein in individual freedom
2997218 break down traditional gender roles and offer children broader role models allowing them to be all they can be
2997219 for both vilda and olika their values are the top priority and i think that is simply the wrong approach when you want to make good childrens books
2997220 you cannot write a book simply because you want it to be gender equal you can however write a good book that is gender equal but as soon as you can see the thought behind the book i think the artistic side has failed
2997221 it is perfectly possible to make good literature that takes these issues into consideration
2997222 we have good authors and illustrators and we insist there is a good story that is absolutely the most important thing
2997223 portraying a gay family in a story that is not simply about gay families shows that these families exist too and are just as normal as other types of families
2997224 i really cant see how that can affect the quality of the story itself
2997225 i guess there are people who really feel very threatened when you try to open up perceptions on sexuality and gender identity
2997226 prerequisite that they only take in authors with the same perspective that affects their access to books in a way that just isnt good
2997227 children do as we do not as we tell them to do if you look around and see women being treated worse than men it makes no difference that youve read a childrens book in which the mother goes to work and the father stays home with the kids

2997289 particularly in the area of depression we did ask the national institute for clinical excellence an independent health organisation that provides national guidance on treatment and prevention to look into this particular area and their guideline on depression did advise non pharmacological treatment for mild depression
2997290 reported associations of subgroups of suicidal behavior e g violent suicide attempts with low csf 5hiaa serotonin concentrations are likely to represent somewhat premature translations of findings from studies that have flaws in methodology
2997291 t he demonstrated efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors cannot be used as primary evidence for serotonergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of these disorders
2997292 must present information that is not inconsistent with the product label
2997293 the efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder social anxiety disorder obsessive compulsive disorder ocd panic disorder pd generalized anxiety disorder gad and post traumatic stress disorder ptsd is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets
2997294 is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity
2997295 c ontains claims concerning the mechanism or site of drug action that are not generally regarded as established by scientific evidence by experts qualified by scientific training and experience
2997296 scientists believe that it could be linked with an imbalance of a chemical in the brain called serotonin
2997297 contains favorable information or opinions about a drug previously regarded as valid but which have been rendered invalid by contrary and more credible recent information
2997298 your concern regarding direct to consumer advertising raises an interesting issue regarding the validity of reductionistic statements these statements are used in an attempt to describe the putative mechanisms of neurotransmitter action s to the fraction of the public that functions at no higher than a 6th grade reading level

2997346 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
2997347 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2997348 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
2997349 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2997350 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
2997351 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
2997352 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2997353 i think theres a lot of hype around the area
2997354 i think we have to be very careful about saying theres a whole new revolutionary period ahead with stem cells embryonic stem cells
2997355 i think in many ways whats going to happen is going to be much more modest so that stem cells will be used for trialling or testing out toxicity of drugs for example
2997356 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2997357 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2997358 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2997359 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2997360 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2997361 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2997362 its exciting because weve found a compound in nature that may one day surpass a currently marketed drug or could become the structural template for rationally designed drugs with improved selectivity

2997399 we found that the vast majority of parents were taking their children to a retail clinic as a substitute for regular care either at a doctors office emergency department or urgent care clinic
2997400 about half of the parents said they wanted to take care of their childrens problems more quickly which suggests to us that doctors offices may not be meeting expectations of parents in terms of providing timely care
2997401 the american academy of peditrics is concerned that retail clinics interrupt the care that kids otherwise would receive from their regular doctors when those interruptions occur in care information about childrens health problems which their doctors need to know about can slip through the cracks and that can lead to worse health care for kids in the long run
2997402 we left this morning and four women were going to the doctor and one was going shopping in al wajhiyah before we reached al wajhiyah the bomb exploded
2997403 esto fue de com n acuerdo con los abogados porque se trataba de defender el pellejo de uno varios rumores previos a la entrega de la presidencia del senado sal an a diario que posiblemente a mi me iban a generar una captura para alguna de las decisiones que se estaban llevando en la investigaci n preliminar y con mis abogados sab amos que no hab a ninguna clase de motivo para que eso ocurriera
2997404 el doctor juan carlos d az investigador especial ante la corte acude a mi oficina a buscar unos documentos dentro de la investigaci n preliminar que adelanta la corte y terminamos conversando sobre los temas de la corte suprema de justicia y l hace una serie de afirmaciones bastante delicadas que yo comparto con mis abogados y se llega a la decisi n de la necesidad de tener un respaldo probatorio y hacer una grabaci n al respecto

2997408 he is a good boy a real mummys boy and his last words to me before the accident were to tell me he loved me an hour later he was in intensive care
2997409 it was heartbreaking to see him in such a state and it is touch and go at the moment but he woke up asking for me and for his little sister on saturday night so that has given us a little bit of hope

2997445 pauls utterly enchanted with nancy and hes already rolling the idea of marriage around in his head he adores everything about her he thinks shes the one and told stella as much he said what would you say if i asked nancy to be the next mrs mccartney and she joked back at least shes financially independent the whole family thinks nancys great a vast improvement on pauls last love interest
2997446 nancy and bruce have been separated a long time but her relationship with paul has spurred them on to finally dissolve the marriage theyve moved on with their lives and bruce approves of paul its all amicable
2997447 theyve been with each other 24 7 a perfect way to see if theyre suitable for marriage pauls not about to rush into anything but hes happier than hes been for years theyve got so much in common he knows heather was a mistake although he loves their little one bea more than anything and wont be put off by a bad divorce experience
2997448 the big feminist lie is that paid employment is always more fulfilling than staying at home and raising children but this has always assumed that all women would be able to find high powered high status highly paid jobs the vast majority of jobs are not a bit like that and many women have cottoned on to this fact they compare their often unglamorous jobs with the task of raising their own children they weigh up the pros and cons of each choice and evidently very many of them are coming down in favour of dropping out of the workforce full time or part time in order to raise children the problem is that many women cant exercise their choice because society and the economy are set up in a such a way that the wish to enter paid employment is encouraged much more than the wish to stay at home raising the kids many women want to be able to choose between work and home career and motherhood we should be doing a lot more to enable that choice

2997453 i think the highlight was getting my picture taken with the teams
2997454 its just a very energetic feeling you know they represent the best of u s athletics and they were really excited about their events and theyre full of hope it was just a very uplifting experience
2997455 its an international games there are people from all over the world watching and not cheering madly

2997458 theyre genuinely pleased that the president came to support them
2997459 and i really believe that it helps them realize the country is supporting them a lot of people are pulling for them
2997460 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2997461 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
2997462 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
2997463 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
2997464 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
2997465 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
2997466 empat 2 a 2 con uls y mereci m s
2997467 esta victoria es muy importante para el grupo ya que ven amos haciendo un gran esfuerzo para lograrla y gracias a dios se dio en un momento especial para nosotros ya que estamos peleando por permanecer en primera divisi n
2997468 vamos a tener una semana tranquila junto a nuestra familia que siempre sufre a la par nuestra
2997469 pero a la vez somos conscientes que tenemos dos finales m s por delante y esta semana trabajaremos para enfrentarnos a newells
2997470 s por ah en lo personal tambi n estoy muy contento ya que se me est dando la posibilidad de convertir pero principalmente ac importa que se gan y estamos sumando para llegar al objetivo de permanecer en la categor a
2997471 viv dos semanas fatales despu s de esos dos errores y creo que este triunfo se lo merec a el equipo por el gran esfuerzo que se realiza d a a d a y hoy por ayer plasmamos un juego que hace tiempo venimos anunciando
2997472 es el triunfo que esper bamos ya que en el segundo tiempo logramos ajustar algunos detalles creciendo en nuestro rendimiento que nos permiti encontrar una diferencia tranquilizadora
2997473 ahora tenemos una semana tranquila para pensar en nuestra pr xima final que es newells en rosario
2997474 la verdad que hoy por ayer hice un buen partido y de a poco estoy recuperando el nivel que ten a
2997475 este grupo trabajo mucho para conseguir un triunfo de esta magnitud ya que el mismo es muy importante en lo an mico para encarar la recta final con otras expectativas
2997476 jugamos un gran partido en el segundo tiempo y logramos plasmar varias situaciones para controlar un cotejo que al principio se nos hab a presentado dif cil
2997477 sab amos que era una final ya que jug bamos con un rival directo y fuimos creciendo en nuestro rendimiento lo cual nos permiti quedarnos con una victoria con cierta tranquilidad
2997478 hablamos acerca de algunos errores que se estaban cometiendo ya que el equipo estaba muy largo y no pod amos generar situaciones de riesgo despu s pudieron juntarse escalada y carranza y de a poco fuimos controlando el cotejo encontrando los espacios suficientes para convertir
2997479 nada l mal interpret algo que yo hab a dicho la verdad que no le dije nada pero si l se sinti ofendido le pido disculpas
2997480 sab amos que ten amos que ganar este encuentro primero por nosotros y como racing empat estamos a tres puntos de ellos pero ahora debemos pensar en lo que viene que es newells
2997481 tuvimos un buen rendimiento hoy por ayer todos hicieron un gran partido pero debemos seguir corrigiendo cosas para cumplir con nuestro objetivo de la permanencia
2997482 hay que seguir sumando el equipo me gust tuvimos situaciones de gol manejamos mejor la pelota aguantamos m s los noventa minutos en una cancha dificil sima estuve leyendo y escuchando el porcentaje de puntos que saca este equipo en su estadio es mucho
2997483 creo que el partido se lo planteamos en la mitad de la cancha le jugamos de igual a igual tuvimos opciones de gol y en el momento que mejor est bamos jugando por un descuido llega el gol de ellos pero bueno seguimos manejando la pelota y nos llevamos un punto importante ante un rival dif cil
2997484 creo que estamos muy comprometidos con la situaci n en la que nos encontramos sabemos que hay que sumar en cada partido que hay que dejar la vida en cada encuentro pero el equipo est entendiendo el mensaje que uno le est dando de jugar 20 o 25 metros m s adelante de presionar y de manejar un poco la pelota creo que en eso llegamos bien por los costados
2997485 ya est hay que pensar en banfield tuvimos un par de mano a mano en el segundo tiempo hubo 15 que nos conform un poco era un partido controlado luchado como sab amos que se iba a presentar manejamos bien la pelota pero nos vamos sin nada ya hay que pensar en el pr ximo partido
2997486 son dos partidos a morir en jujuy hoy los muchachos dejaron todo y no nos alcanz las distracciones se suelen pagar caro y hoy lo pagamos nosotros
2997487 me voy con bronca porque fue un partido disputado y m s que nada porque nos agarran con un gol de arco a arco que eso en el f tbol moderno no existe
2997488 la de mateo en el palo la de miramontes que pudo haber tirado centro y el eligi tirar al arco situaciones tuvimos y no la pudimos convertir ahora tenemos dos partidos de local que tenemos que revertir esta situaci n porque con los merecimientos ya no nos podemos quedar tenemos que apuntar a lo que viene
2997489 si porque central y col n nos llevan diez puntos y se torna inalcanzable podemos decir que la matem tica nos da pero ac esta visto que tenemos que pelear entre olimpo san juan y nosotros y a pelearla
2997490 la gente a veces tiene mala memoria hicimos la mejor campa a en sumatoria de puntos desde que estuvieron en primera divisi n 49 pero ac me trataron muy bien y no tengo nada que decirdespu s cuando uno viene de rival no nos tratan de la mejor forma pero a la gente yo siempre le voy a estar agradecida porque siempre han valorado mi trabajo
2997491 siden den her konflikt er meget lokal af sin art og m ske minder mere om ruslands lange konflikt med tjetjenien s er effekterne minimale og det er ikke umiddelbart en konflikt der rammer euroen specifikt
2997492 der kommer m ske en indirekte effekt via den russiske rubel fordi den russiske rubel er styret af en kurs p 50 procent dollar og 50 procent euro og hvis de skal styre deres usdrub kurs s skal de muligvis intervenere i euro det har vi ikke set endnu men der kan v re en afledt effekt heraf

2997500 im so middle class its unbelievable my father was a civil servant i was brought up in middle class surrey thats it its the perfect middle class pedigree
2997501 my line is that photography by its nature is exploitative its unavoidable especially if you are earning money from it youre basically earning money from other peoples image most photographers would never admit that photography is exploitative they try to hide it because of their humanistic ideals
2997502 it would be the embracing of a sworn enemy whose meteoric rise in magnum was closely linked with the moral climate of thatchers rule let me state that i have great respect for him as the dedicated enemy of everything i believe in and i trust what magnum still believes in
2997503 was one of the first to break that humanist tradition that was so strong in the previous generation they thought i was exploitative cynical even fascist all kinds of words were used
2997504 the philosophy of a man taking himself seriously without humor where rancor and scorn dominate a nihilistic attitude symptomatic of society today
2997505 i acknowledge there is a large gap between your celebration of life and my implied criticism of it
2997506 i have kept producing new work new books and i guess in the end people take that seriously if youre around long enough and you keep doing new work and it keeps provoking an audience to dislike you and obviously some people like it as well people will notice what you do
2997507 it is the spectator and not life that art really mirrors diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new complex and vital

2997511 sebutkanlah kepada ku nama benda benda itu jika kamu mamang benar orang orang yang benar
2997512 artinya pendidikan tidak hanya berubah dari zaman ke zaman namun ia sangat peka tergantung pada tempat dan waktu dia melahirkan suatu makna yang berbeda pada setiap negara dan benar benar tidak sama desa tempat sekitar seperti dalam wilayah yang padat industrinya
2997513 artinya pada saat sang anak siap untuk memasuki pendidikan formal dia sudah terlatih memiliki potensi aktivitas pada dirinya sendiri
2997514 barangsiapa yang yang ingin hidup didunia ini baik hendaklah ia berilmu barangsiapa yang ingin hidup bahagia diakhirat hendaklah berilmu dan barangsiapa yang ingin hidup bahagia keduanya hendaklah ia berilmu demikianlah manusia ini mulia disisi allah karena iman dan ilmu pengetahuannya akibat manusia menggunakan akal pikirannya perasaan dan ilmu pengetahuannya muncullah kebudayaan berupa hasil karya cipta rasa dan karsanya demikian pula dapat membentuk sikap perilaku dan cara hidup semua yang terkumpul dala otak manusia yang bentuk ilmu pengetahuan itu adalah kebudayaan untuk menciptakan kesejahteraan dan ketenangan dalam berkarya perlu selalu dilandasi dengan norma etika dan agama tanpa keduanya ini akan dapat menimbulkan bahaya dalam agama islam khususnya pendidikan islam dipandang sebagai pengikat dan penuntun kejalan yang lurus sehingga budaya yang timbul akan dapat memberi manfaat bukan saja kepada dirinya sendiri tetapi juga kepada orang lain pola pendidikan islam akan dapat membimbing manusia untuk memperoleh akal pikiran yang sehat dan rasional dalam rangka menunjang terciptanya insan kamil dengan demikianakan dapat mewariskan norma dan etika sosial yang religius kepada generasi selanjutnya firman allah swt dalam surat ad dukhan ayat 28 yang berbunyi pelanjut berati mengandung pelestarian budaya kepada kelompok penerus tugas dan tanggung jawabnya adalah melestarikan kewajiban pendidik secara estafet bukan saja bimbingan dan nilai nilai moral tetapi juga akhlak dan tingkah laku sehari hari di kat tanggung jawab itu perlu memelihara dan mengembangkan ketentraman dan kelestarian manusia dan alam lingkungan manusia yang dilahirkan ke dunia pada dasarnya adalah berpotensi untuk dididik sehingga ia mampu menjadi khalifah pelindung dan pengembang kebudayaan yang dilengkapi dengan f firman allah swt yang berbentuk potensi itu tidak akan mengalami perubahan karena sudah merupakan kodrat ilahi yang dapat diubah adalah tingkat kualitasnya semakin berpotensi seseorang tentu semakin dapat peluang untuk meningkatkan mutunya manusia itu dapat berpikir berperasaan berkehendak dan bertindak serta berperilaku fitrah inilah yang dapat membedakan manusia dengan makhluk lainnya sekaligus manusia sebagai makhluk paedagogis dapat dididik dan dapat pula mendidik orang lain dengan pendidikan dan pengajaran potensi itu dapat dikembangkan kewajiban mengembangkan potensi itu merupakan beban dan tanggung jawab manusia kepada allah swt kemungkinan pengembangan potensi itu berarti bahwa manusia itu dapat dididik dan suatu saat dia juga dapat mendidik dan inilah yang disebut belajar mengajar kenyataan dalam sejarah memberikan bukti bahwa memang manusia itu secara potensial adalah makhluk yang pantas dibebani kewajiban dan tanggung jawab menerima dan melaksanakan ajaran allah swt oleh sebab itu setiap umat dituntut supaya beriman dan beramal sesuai dengan petunjuk yang digariskan oleh allah dan rasul nya petunjuk itu tidak akan datang dengan sendirinya melainkan harus melalui melalui usaha dan aktivitas karena itu usaha dan kegiatan membina pribadi adalah suatu kewajiban mutlak usaha dan kegiatan itu disebut dengan pendidikan dengan kata lain bahwa pendidikan itu adalah usaha dan kegiatan pembinaan pribadi pola dasar pendidikan islam adalah pembentukan pribadi muslim inti pribadi muslim itu adalah pengamalan seluruh perintah allah dan rasul nya pribadi muslim itu tidak akan tercapai kecuali dengan realisasi pendidikan dan pengajaran secara utuh terpadu dan terintegrasi tanpa membedakan antara pendidikan umum dan pendidikan agama dualisme pendidikan yang dirasakan selama ini memberi kesan tersendiri bahwa terdapat diskriminasi antara pendidikan yang dilaksanakan oleh departemen pendidikan nasional dengan pendidikan yang dilaksanakan oleh departemen agama akibatnya pendidikan itu pincang di satu sisi pendidikan umum semakin melaju dan berkembang dengan pesatnya jauh dari jangkauan pengelola pendidikan di departemen agama ditinjau dari segi dana dan pembiayaan serta sumber daya manusia sangat jauh perbedaannya sarana dan prasarananya juga demikian di sisi lain pendidikan agama kurang mendapat perhatian mengingat anggaran pendidikan di departemen agama sangat minim dengan demikian wajar saja sektor anggaran pendidikan agama di departemen agama mengalami situasi yang tidak seimbang apabila dibandingkan dengan di departemen pendidikan nasional yang memang hanya mengelola pendidikan saja namun demikian pendidikan agama islam tidak dapat hanya diperbincangkan saja tanpa ada usaha konkret yang menunjang tercapainya kemajuan dan peningkatan upaya ini ada pada usaha yang kontinue dari semua unsur pengelola dan penguasa pemerintah serta seluruh masyarakat memang tidak dapat disangkal bahwa faktor dana dewasa ini memegang peranan penting oleh karena itu sector pembiayaan harus mempunya korelasi yang positif antara pemerintah dan seluruh lapisan masyarakat secara terorganisir keterlibatan semua unsur dalam merealisasikan pendidikan tidak dapat diabaikan begitu saja melainkan harus disertai dengan tekad bulat berdasar niat yang ikhlas serta kemauan dan kedermawanan pada dasarnya pendidikan itu adalah tanggung jawab semua masyarakat peranan pemerintah adalah melindungi membina mengawasi dan membantu sesuai dengan kemampuan anggaran yang tersedia pola dasar pendidikan islam tidak dapat dipisahkan dengan sumber ajaran islam itu sendiri yaitu berlandaskan kepada 1 2 as sunnah rasulullah dan 3 ijtihad di samping ini juga imam syafei menambahkan dengan qiyas dan ijma shahabat sistem pembinaan di satu pihak dituntut agar senantiasa sesuai dengan perkembangan zaman ilmu pengetahuan dan teknologi di pihak lain juga diharapkan agar tetap bertahan dalam kesesuaian dengan ajaran islam yang dianutnya hal ini merupakan masalah yang senantiasa menuntut mujtahid muslim di bidang pendidikan untuk selalu berijtihad sehingga teori pendidikan islam selalu relevan dengan tuntutan zaman kegiatan pendidikan dan pengajaran yang merupakan tugas setiap warga negara dan pemerintah harus belandaskan falsafah dan pandangan hidup bangsa itu oleh karena itu pola dasar pendidikan modern harus disesuaikan dengan falsafah negara dan pandangan hidup serta ajaran agama yang dianut oleh masyarakat tersebut sebagai penganut suatu agama yang baik seharusnya dapat menetralisasi berbagai pandangan agama yang relatif sama sehingga dapat meredam perbedaan faham yang tajam maka warga negara yang setia pada falsafah bangsanya harus dapat menyesuaikan diri dengan pandangan hdidup dan ajaran agama yang dianutnya masing masing secara simultan dan terintegrasi tanpa saling mengganggu dan mempersalahkan pendapat orang lain sehingga tercipta rasa kebersamaan dan hidup dalam suasana rukun dan damai tanpa konflik manusia berdomisili dalam lingkungan masyarakat yang tidak saja bersifat homogen sama tetapi juga mungkin bersifat heterogen oleh karena itu peranan penyesuaian diri adaptasi menjadi sangat urgen dalam rangka menjaga kerukunan hidup bermasyarakat masyarakat turut pula memikul tanggung jawab dan memberi warna terhadap pendidikan sebagai salah satu unsur pemimpin di samping guru dan orang tua pemimpin masyarakat muslim tentu saja menghendaki agar setiap anak didik menjadi anggota masyarakat yang taat dan patuh menjalankan ajaran agamanya sebagai manusia yang mempunyai kodrat sosial tentu dia menginginkan hidup damai sejahtera dalam suasana tolong menolong antarsesama sebagai anggota masyarakat manusia tidak bersifat egois karena hal ini bertentangan dengan sifat esensi dan hakikat kehidupan setiap manusia memandang sesamanya dalam taraf yang sama tidak berbeda karena dia adalah makhluk allah yang berbeda adalah sifat karakter pembawaan sejak lahir dan selera setiap individu serta akhlak dan tingkah lakunya jika masing masing individu bisa terbentuk secara baik melalui pendidikan maka semua orang akan memiliki akhlak yang tinggi dengan pendidikan setiap individu akan mengalami pembauran bentuk sosial karena pergeseran budaya pergaulan dan sikap sosial dengan perasaan sosial dapat menciptakan toleransi dan saling menghargai saling menghormati serta sikap kebersamaan manusia makhluk religious dan berakhlakul karimah manusia dalam pandangan islam sama halnya dengan pandangan agama monoteisme lainnya tersusun dari dua unsur yaitu unsur jasmani dan unsur rohani tubuh manusia berasal dari materi dan mempunyai kebutuhan hidup kebendaan sedangkan rohani bersifat immateri dan mempunyai kebutuhan hidup spiritual kehidupan jasmani mempunyai keinginan hawa nafsu sehingga mudah hanyut terpengaruh kepada jalan kejahatan sedangkan rohani karena berasal dari yang suci maka tentu ia mengajak kepada kesucian dari konsep ini menunjukkan manusia perlu untuk beragama dan sekaligus mementingkan akhlakul karimah sabda nabi saw artinya

2997560 i dont understand them when governor daniel was campaigning for the second term he promised to see to the issue of drainages in ijebu ode and its environs as that was the major problem facing the area but since he assumed office he has not done anything towards that instead he is quarrelling with the lawmakers in the state there is nothing these people will offer us again
2997561 these people know what they are supposed to do a big city like ijebu ode is in this shameful condition and we have representatives at federal state and local levels whatre they doing there nothing the local government chairman has not done anything praise worthy no good roads no water no electricity while security is total zero i advise him to wake up from his slumber and perform

2997567 his financial contributions go to every politician regardless of party affiliation in fact there is no politician of note in this state who did not have financial support during the elections from mangal
2997568 you could see that his relationship with president yaradua since he was the governor in katsina has gone beyond that of party relations to reliable comradeship to the extent that yaradua refers to him in any of his speeches as mai girma honourable dahiru mangal
2997569 i remember when we found it difficult to achieve some things mangal would insist and lead the way for us that way we continued to work together until destiny changed his fortunes for the better
2997570 he has rendered a lot of assistance to many in katsina state if one wants to put it down on a list it would be very long
2997571 he is extremely generous and ever ready to give to those who needed help most
2997572 he apart from being the main financier of the pdp in february this year mobilised forces to ensure that the pdp had a smooth sail to the seats of the 34 local government chairmen of katsina state he played the same role during the election of senators house of representatives and house of assembly members

2997598 infected men have lower iqs achieve a lower level of education and have shorter attention spans they are also more likely to break rules and take risks be more independent more anti social suspicious jealous and morose and are deemed less attractive to women
2997599 on the other hand infected women tend to be more outgoing friendly more promiscuous and are considered more attractive to men compared with non infected controls
2997600 in short it can make men behave like alley cats and women behave like sex kittens
2997601 the increasing body of evidence connecting toxoplasma infection with changes in personality and mental state combined with the extremely high incidence of human infection in both developing and developed countries warrants increased government funding and research in particular to find safe and effective treatments or vaccines dr boulter said

2997618 we were in a room in the farmhouse with a door facing out on to the veranda
2997619 the 7ft high door was open a couple of inches and starlight was flooding through we heard a deep guttural vocalisation a few seconds later something passed by the door blocking out the starlight to a height of at least 7ft we grabbed our cameras and rushed out into the night but whatever it was had vanished

2997635 average roundtrip cost of jet fuel todays prices is about 300 per passenger we would have to charge about 650 700 a passenger to break even
2997636 fares probably need to increase at this point another 15 20 percent before airlines cover their costs

2997656 i think it was one of those memos that was written looked at by the candidate and wisely discarded
2997657 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
2997658 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters and then produces a strategy that all through the summer and into the fall and almost up to iowa is cautious calculating triangulating and is basically a replica of president clintons 1996 reelection strategy when he had no competitive primaries i mean its undeniable that she ran on inevitability she ran as the candidate of the establishment she ran as a quasi incumbent in a year of change it was a terrible mistake so if mark penn understood what the targets were in march maybe they should have come up with a strategy that would have reached those targets
2997659 campaign it seems from these memos to have been at least as focused on the staff going after each other as they were on going after the nomination and getting past barack obama
2997660 by the way one thing we shouldnt ignore in all of this they can all stand around pointing fingers at each other theyre not pointing fingers at the one person who deserves the most blame for their defeat and that is barack obama
2997661 he was an extraordinary candidate who resonated with what america feels and felt and what democrats felt as he went through those primaries
2997662 theres a certain strength in the sense of centeredness and almost the serenity that the obama campaign has displayed
2997663 they have a strategy theyve executed it consistently they dont get thrown off by day to day polls i remember last september there were all these people who were saying obama is behind clinton hes got to go out and hes got to attack her hes got to run negative ads and some of his own people and fundraising people said that and he held a conference call and he said im not doing that i know what the strategy is i know what i want to say i know how to reach people now ill tell you something youre a lot better off in a campaign with a strategy consistently adhered to than with 20 people debating ten competing strategies moving day to day

2997685 atiku had shown his mastery of politics in the past nine years and the period preceding the 2007 presidential election when the time comes for him to decide if it ever comes to that he would do that without promptings

2997821 high street retailers overtook their online only counterparts for the first time during december 2006 but quickly fell behind again for most of 2007
2997822 however when the high street overtook again last christmas the gap was even greater than before and during 2008 the online only retailers only managed to edge ahead during february
2997823 given the 2 6 percent year on year decline in actual physical visits to retailers reported by experian footfall for july it looks like high street retailers will be more reliant than ever on their online operations this christmas
2997824 the growth of the online fashion industry has been one of the main contributors to the increasing market share of high street retailers online
2997825 however there are exceptions to the rule asos was the second most visited website in our shopping and classifieds apparel and accessories category in july 2008 uk internet traffic to online only fashion retailers has more than doubled over the last 12 months
2997826 consumers may be cutting back in terms of discretionary spending but they are not about to send their kids to school without the necessities
2997827 consumers are clearly shifting to value and one stop shop channels as they seek to optimize shopping trips
2997828 retailers at risk this back to school season are the specialty retailers such as office supply stores where distinct trips are needed and apparel retailers which are heavily skewed to discretionary spending
2997829 consumers recognize that retail prices tend to fall the closer we get to the first day of school
2997830 stung by high gas and food prices many consumers will likely hold out as long as possible waiting for retailers to drop prices on items kids need for the new school year

2997867 what you really want sometimes is for google to say no to itself
2997868 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2997869 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2997870 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2997871 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2997872 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2997873 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2997874 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2997875 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2997876 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2997877 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens

2997928 with the exception of a few palate challenged columnists nearly everybody rich or poor urban or rural liberal or conservative can taste the difference between a freshly picked locally grown tomato and the wan flavorless kind you find at the supermarket factor in rising fuel costs food safety fears and the yearning to preserve open space and youve got a movement thats picking up steam and passengers rich folks are hiring edible landscapers small scale farmers are thriving and the rest of us are flocking to greenmarkets and planting our own veggie gardens a handful of knee jerk naysayers at the times cant derail this local train

2997934 the inseparable connection established by god which man on his own initiative may not break between the unitive significance and the procreative significance which are both inherent to the marriage act
2997935 if therefore there are well grounded reasons for spacing births arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife or from external circumstances the church teaches that married people may then take advantage of the natural cycles immanent in the reproductive system and engage in marital intercourse only during those times that are infertile thus controlling birth in a way which does not in the least offend the moral principles which we have just explained
2997936 with regard to physical economic psychological and social conditions responsible parenthood is exercised by those who prudently and generously decide to have more children and by those who for serious reasons and with due respect to moral precepts decide not to have additional children for either a certain or an indefinite period of time
2997937 the standard factors which usually determine the rates at which mortgage rates are set including bank base rate swap rates and libor rates are all much lower than this time last year yet the rates on offer are much higher

2997946 we are stunned that ryanair is treating its customers in this way
2997947 ryanair is pursuing legal actions in a number of european countries to bring an end to this unlawful and anti consumer activity
2997948 ryanair will introduce new procedures to cancel all passenger bookings made through screenscraping websites we believe this is a quicker and more effective way of discouraging this unlawful activity
2997949 we are stunned that ryanair is treating its customers in this way
2997950 at a time when many people are struggling to afford holidays overseas airlines should be finding ways to make it easier for families to book and travel not making it even harder
2997951 this move by ryanair can only penalise their own customers and damage their reputation as an airline and we would hope that they would seriously reconsider what they are doing
2997952 i have never seen anything like this in my career for software
2997953 but i felt good in the water and i said alright lets go
2997954 its great revenge for what happened this morning fifth place in the 400m freestyle i showed that i have mint form
2997955 i dont want to say i cruised it but i swam it the way i wanted it doesnt matter until the finals as long as you have a lane you are in it
2997956 we consider that the latest developments such as the crossing of the georgian borders by russian troops changed the dimension of the conflict
2997957 we therefore call upon russia to stop immediately all military activity on georgian territory
2997958 we remain extremely concerned at the continuing violence and bloodshed in georgia and repeat our calls for an immediate end of hostilities and a swift return to negotiations
2997959 we are not just facing military action but a humanitarian crisis

2997970 because its fine for actors to cynically go bobbing for academy apples every year by playing a special character but its not okay for a comic actor to make fun of them for doing so

2997973 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2997974 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2997975 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2997976 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2997977 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2997978 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2997979 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2997980 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2997996 weve seen a significant rise in the number of users over the past couple months as prices rise there are more and more people looking for ways to save a pound or two and cashback websites are ideal our message to people feeling the strain is that they dont need to completely alter what they buy they just need to consider how they buy it cashback websites offer deals as high as 50 back on purchases and users can save by simply switching their energy insurance providers or mobile phone plans

2998002 we need to create an environment in schools that reflects the importance of science and the value of studying it we also need to send an unambiguous message to young people who are good at science that science as a career can be fascinating and worthwhile and will reward you well

2998005 the cbi is pushing at an open door the government has introduced an entitlement from this september the problem it has is there are not enough physics teachers
2998006 the problem schools have is in fitting three subjects into a two subject slot the separate sciences have continued to thrive in independent schools because their pupils are able to choose any combination at gcse and do not have to do all three it could be that state school pupils should be allowed the same freedom as their independent counterparts
2998007 we think this is the most practical way of building capacity in schools and developing our most promising scientists
2998008 i think all foreigners should stop interfering in the internal affairs of iraq

2998031 just like other governors of the niger delta states senator imoke in the last one year focused his attention towards achieving rapid rural development of the rural communities which to a large extent has doused the youth restiveness in the area
2998032 we believe that the educational economic empowerment of the youth of the niger delta is key to ending the upsurge in violent militancy in the oil rich but heavily neglected region we are seriously impressed with his excellent human rights record which he achieved in the last one calendar year that he presided over the affairs of cross rivers state as the chief servant

2998047 pfupajena obviously has something to hide for him to have reacted so violently this abortionist is a danger to the public and should have his license revoked
2998048 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
2998049 the 20th century was defined by three trends the battle for freedom in the face of statism tyranny and marxist oppression the cultural supplanting of christianity in favor of secular humanism and evolutionary scientism and the general withdrawal of evangelical christianity as a source of cultural transformation in favor of a more ecumenical and sentimental gospel presentation
2998050 just over eighty nine years ago and within twelve months of each other three men were born who would help to define and shape each of these trends respectively alexander solzhenitsyn arthur c clarke and billy graham clarke died in march solzhenitsyn died yesterday only graham yet lives
2998051 today vision forum ministries and freedom loving christians all over the world mourn the death of the man most responsible for revealing the evil of the anti christian regime of joseph stalin and waging war against a machine of marxist oppression that caused the death of tens of millions
2998052 tortured and persecuted within stalins death camps solzhenitsyn nonetheless endured secretly authoring his greatest work the gulag archipelago on scrounged toilet paper
2998053 though solzhenitsyn was a devoted russian nationalist he was also a grateful resident of the united states during his years in exile from his homeland
2998054 in 1978 solzhenitsyn made the following appeal during his address at harvard
2998055 the courage of solzhenitsyn to boldly speak truth in the face of tremendous opposition touched the lives of many individuals including myself

2998058 apple needs to do a lot of work to improve communications between developers and the people in charge of the app store

2998062 the speed of their replacement suggests that they dont want to give microsoft any wiggle room when it comes to the adoption of hyper v inside the data center
2998063 microsoft has a well earned reputation for destroying even the most brilliant competitors and the hyper v launch ahead of schedule no doubt has already placed additional pressures on vmware
2998064 it appears that vmware was not going to meet analyst revenue estimates and so the board decided to take quick action
2998065 it brought in someone with an intimate knowledge of microsofts inner workings and the companys approach to marketing to help

2998095 it is a huge and exciting project and with tenders already being sent out for the contractors and designers our work has already started
2998096 there will be three tunnels to be bored and with tunnelling there are always risks and challenges especially when you consider that these will be in the heart of a major city
2998097 the second is the fact that as part of the project there will be nine new stations constructed and some of those stations will be deep underground in effect each station will have a core box and the risks for the station construction are a considerable part of the project
2998098 lastly is the rolling stock the trains which will operate on the line are being built specially and they will be stored in preparation for the service to begin it leaves us with a major accumulation issue should they be damaged or destroyed by fire or explosion prior to coming into service
2998099 the history aspect is a risk but we are also in a situation where the route will go close to existing london underground tunnels and stations and there is the risk of impacting on their operation if there is any problems
2998100 the other factor is that the crossrail project will be well underway by the time london hosts the 2012 olympics and areas such as the movement of earth from the tunnels may need to be handled carefully given the fact that the city will want to look pristine for the games
2998101 it is fair to say that lloyds and the rest of the london market will assume much of the risk
2998102 the major markets for these risks are in london and we would assume that they will be keen to play a part on the programme

2998127 pode dizer se que estava muito excitado perdi a voz e estava muito emocionado
2998128 but its something that once you make that decision you have to live with it i just tried to find some room to run with the ball
2998129 in the preseason you can get away with some of those kinds of things
2998130 in the regular season im not so sure he should have run that out
2998131 there was some excitement when the ball was in his hands so he showed some promise he has got a lot of quickness and suddenness and because of his size that allows him to have some of that now that doesnt necessarily make him a good player because hes small and quick
2998132 but he is smart and tough he can catch the ball and those are the things that allow him to be out here on this field
2998133 coach crennel wants to see me out there in different situations i thought i played pretty well last thursday
2998134 i just have to keep moving forward i have to make a lot more progress than what i made last thursday now i have to watch the film listen to the coaches and keep trying to get better this week
2998135 it is realized that the league is incapable of rendering material aid and that the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized countries is unlikely to make any impression upon soviet russia
2998136 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2998137 while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia

2998230 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2998231 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2998232 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2998233 its good to send a signal to the chinese people that we respect them that this is about their country
2998234 he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
2998235 the hour of liberation for france is the hour when germany wins the war

2998262 i knew 1 55 1 56 would be enough to get through and thats how it felt i was doing as i was swimming along

2998351 as part of an agreement reached in june todays passage will allow the city to reactivate a marine transfer station to process recyclables on manhattans gansevoort peninsula governor patersons signature on the legislation passed today will mean we have cleared the final legislative hurdle to implementing the citys historic solid waste management plan the plan will eliminate nearly six million miles of truck trips per year in new york city and will ensure that every borough has the capacity to handle waste and recyclables i would like to thank majority leader skelos and the entire senate as well as speaker silver and the assembly for helping make the successful implementation of this plan possible
2998352 every borough needs to do its share when it comes to waste management and for too long the outer boroughs have been doing all of the dirty work
2998353 by creating a marine transfer station on the gansevoort peninsula manhattan will become an equal partner in the important job of managing our waste stream i want to thank assembly speaker silver majority leader skelos and his predecessor joseph bruno for all their work in passing this critically important piece of legislation i urge governor paterson to quickly sign the bill

2998361 the success of iowa hsemd shows the strength of this state in managing recovery efforts after disasters
2998362 the accelerometer itself measures acceleration that recognises sense of gravity within the computing world this technology is used within laptops in order to protect data stored on the hard drive
2998363 it is likely that the disk drive read write head will collide with the surface of the platter this is where the data is stored causing an indentation and creating debris that will circulate within the drive enclosure often resulting in further damage
2998364 the accelerometer is designed to prevent this it recognises the change in motion and signals to the hard drive that an impact is imminent the read write head is then moved to the parked position where damage to the hard drive is minimised
2998365 earthquake detection requires the continuous measurement of seismic activity over a long period of time and predicting the location of the epicentre is particularly difficult
2998366 i am proud to join with fema in announcing this new grant for the people of cedar rapids
2998367 these dollars will allow this community to continue their recovery efforts and be vital in helping to return life to normal for this eastern iowa community as governor i will continue to work with our federal partners to ensure that the citizens of iowa have the resources they need by working together on the local state and federal levels i am confident that we can rebuild iowa and create a brighter stronger future for everyone
2998368 cedar rapids is doing a tremendous job collecting the disaster debris so quickly
2998369 the people of cedar rapids are safer because the city is efficiently removing hazardous materials and dangerous debris
2998370 while there were those involved in the protest who were sensible and responsible there were also those clearly intent on breaking into the power station to shut it down
2998371 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
2998372 the decision to deploy specialist units including dogs and horses is always considered carefully because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest
2998373 there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop
2998374 most yemeni plants that grow in the wild are drought resistant by nature
2998375 even sorghum and millet edible grains have become drought resistant in the wild
2998376 18 of greenhouse gases are produced by animal farming fight climate change go vegan
2998377 climate change is one of the greatest and most imminent threats that we face and animal famings role in that needs to be more widely known
2998378 a 2007 un food and agricultural organisation report found that livestock farming and industrial fishing currently accounts for 18 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions this is even more than the 13 5 per cent caused by transport
2998379 we are asking the government to provide information about farmings role in the climate change and to make it an issue
2998380 there has been no statement of the problem and the wider public have no idea of the statistics involved all the major political parties claim to be addressing climate change issues but none of them has addressed this part of it at all
2998381 we dont have any comment to make were just trying to deal with the people on the roof
2998382 while we would like it if everyone adopted a vegan diet we dont believe in imposing ways of life on to people but information should be given and policies considered that could encourage people to change possibly including increased taxes on the production and consumption of animal products
2998383 an animal based diet is no longer sustainable with climate change threatening the planet its ecosystems and the people who depend on them
2998384 we should tell our people that their livelihood and survival depend on these forests the forests help in manufacturing the rain we will not compromise on this we can relocate people to other areas
2998385 you are not an authority on the environment let us consult nema before your plan can be implemented

2998392 if we do attack it is going to be a disaster
2998393 i was astounded to see on one of the networks the other day that the debate was not are we going to attack but are we going to attack before or after the election
2998394 if that comes up it is demanding that the president put in place an absolute blockade of the entire country of iran and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with iran
2998395 the frightening thing is they say they are taking no options off the table even nuclear first strike
2998396 doesnt look like the other presidents on those dollar bills
2998397 if on the sabbath a man receives circumcision so that the law of moses is not broken are you angry because on the sabbath i made a mans whole body well do not judge by outward appearances
2998398 its a baptism a little water on a little head very sweet but what does it really do
2998399 its a piece of bread and thimble full of wine so what what does that do
2998400 it was awful i couldnt even do the simplest household chores such as mopping or scrubbing the floor
2998401 it hurt so much that i could not bend to scrub the floor or even grip the mop
2998402 although i am feeling much better the joint pains wont go away
2998403 there are about 200 families in this area and you can say that at least one in every family has had high fever
2998404 initially we rushed him to the local hospital where he was also put on saline drips and given antibiotics
2998405 we returned home the same day and to my relief my father said he felt better
2998406 he died four days from the day he was warded the doctor did not mention the name of the fever but said it was new in the country and was carried by mosquitoes
2998407 i learnt that several open water retainers were placed in the nests for the birds to bathe and drink the symptom of chikungunya fever was attack people at
2998408 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
2998409 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
2998410 i cant say i understand the rules of the media and im not sure they do either
2998411 the indians favor exchanges with the world the europeans favor exchanges with men neither of them is intrinsicly superior to the other and one always needs both if one side only prevails there is much to lose

2998414 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2998415 so if he obama were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what im really not first and foremost concerned with is this person capable of being president of the united states what im concerned about is can he bring me the electoral votes of the state of virginia
2998416 when youre filming a show like this and youre dealing with women who hate their bodies you need somewhere to let it all out
2998417 im not a doctor or a psychologist but i have to take it on as their friend and i realised i was feeling quite stressed out with it
2998418 if you can imagine eight of your best girlfriends all of them going through the most horrific time and needing you and only you its a lot to take on board you become a sponge of course i do take it on because i care for them but i need to get rid of it as well but once ive let it out its gone as soon as i stop filming i stop seeing my counsellor
2998419 when i was little the teacher asked everyone in the class what do you want to be when you grow up and i said happy i didnt know it was going to be so hard

2998446 tenemos un reto m s grande en estos momentos porque ahora tenemos que ganarlo todo b sicamente para poder clasificar a la segunda ronda
2998447 en estas pr cticas trabajamos mucho en ajustar la ofensiva pero esto no es como en los playoffs de la nba que uno juega con un mismo equipo y tiene todo un proceso de an lisis del rival
2998448 me siento muy bien para el juego de ma ana y conf o en que podemos hacer un buen trabajo contra los australianos
2998449 para ambos equipos va a ser como un juego de la final porque no podemos perder australia tiene un buen equipo le ganamos un juego muy re ido en el diamondball as que sabemos lo que enfrentamos
2998450 no tenemos lesiones carlos delfino hab a tenido unos problemas en el tobillo de tendonitis pero ya est bien as que estamos en buenas condiciones
2998451 australia es un gran equipo pero nosotros estamos motivados para el juego de ma ana porque sabemos que no podemos perder
2998452 n s somos uma equipe todos n s viemos aqui para fazer uma coisa para conquistar a medalha de ouro e n s conseguimos isso juntos
2998453 acho que michael phelps sabe que n o fizemos isso por ele
2998454 ele foi apenas parte disso e n s ramos parte tamb m se ele conquistar oito medalhas de ouro ou n o isso n o ser nossa responsabilidade

2998465 fiz cinco enterradas em uma partida e isso foi pelo p blico
2998466 creio que a ltima vez que consegui cinco enterradas em uma partida foi aos 17 anos
2998467 a energia era diferente da de uma final da nba era muito maior
2998468 as pessoas receberam o valor que pagaram pelas entradas porque lebron kobe e os outros garotos deram um grande show

2998472 social networking started out as communication and entertainment and now has evolved into more basic things such as business services and finance
2998473 starting from just a few hundred thousand today we expect 2 million u s households will be using social personal finance sites by the end of next year
2998474 the key to that is that people are just able to be more proactive in their decision making
2998475 its good to have tools but its very nice to be able to join in a community of people who think the way i do who may have similar situations as me a community that can help create the drive the passion and the desire to follow through
2998476 its a place for serious investors who want to discuss strategies and tactics that can help them become better traders
2998477 it allows for knowledge building skill building the exchange of information with like minded investors to pursue a strategy to pursue a particular investment
2998478 i wouldnt use it to go in and say tell me the next stock thats going to go up two points
2998479 it will be a highly focused lead or answer or commentary on some particular subject at the 10 000 foot level
2998480 there is a financial value to leveraging your social relationships on the internet and there is a behavioral aspect in changing the way finance works
2998481 people are much more comfortable in discussing their financial stories
2998482 the more i do it the more i enjoy just being able to help out people in desperate times who just cant get loans elsewhere
2998483 youre seeing a lot of creditworthy people who used to have lots of options who have really been limited
2998484 were seeing those people now come to prosper as another alternative its really changed the type of customer were seeing

2998506 currently the only relief for diabetes is a momentary relief
2998507 diabetics still have to monitor their blood and urine sugar levels they have to inject themselves with insulin several times a day having a permanent solution for this im sure would be pretty exciting
2998508 this work helps connect our psychological understanding of why we like some things and not others with the genetic mechanisms that define our range of behaviors
2998509 in the ongoing discussion about how much the environment versus genetics determine behavior this study points to how the interaction between these factors influences our judgment and decision making
2998510 we were surprised to see that variation in the creb1 gene would account for more than 20 percent of the difference in how healthy participants weighed different options and expressed specific preferences
2998511 our previous studies and the work of other groups suggested that variation in this gene could be important for judgment and decision making by the brain but we needed to connect this to a measurable decision making effect in both behavior and brain activity
2998512 this study connects quantitative measurements across three levels of observation brain activity genomic variation and the expression of preference we now are investigating the potential role of other genes and will go on to assess how this relationship across three levels of observation may be affected by conditions such as depression and addiction
2998513 a failure of the rice crop in the state would certainly be a cause for concern it is a large producer and a large consumer

2998522 but hes still warming up hes still getting back into the swing of things i know hes got more fire coming so it should be interesting
2998523 its obviously a different ball than anyone ive played with before i played with vinny testaverde and he had a pretty hard ball but its still different its a different spin
2998524 i try to get as close as possible to it so its coming a little bit faster
2998525 it was just like a game out there the way he just pumped it and threw it right in the hole before the safety could get over there heck of a throw
2998526 obviously he can make any and everything so anything is possible
2998527 whatever they can draw up in the sand he can do it it makes it more challenging for the defense and makes it more fun for us on offense its more fun to get out there and run your routes when you know youre a viable option on every play

2998529 the impact of this on my life and my family is hard to imagine
2998530 i have lost everything my job my health and i have had years of what should have been a happy retirement stolen from me
2998531 to say that i was shocked doesnt really do it justice
2998532 i was exhilarated to have survived the operation and then to be told that i didnt have cancer i could not get my head around the words
2998533 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2998534 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2998535 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2998536 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2998537 this was a heinous attack by al qaeda in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2998538 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2998539 al qaeda is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2998540 es war eine schwere geburt je l nger es torlos steht desto besser wird die situation f r den underdog

2998542 conversion to islam art 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini amp shamala revisited
2998543 is this an admission that umno had plotted for the extreme reaction to the bar council forum on religious conversions in kuala lumpur on saturday
2998544 i have been informed that disciplinary action would be taken against him the pakatan rakyat leadership will have to address the pakatan rakyat disarray over this issue
2998545 dap is also disappointed that deputy prime minister datuk seri najib razaks irresponsible remarks in condoning extreme hooligan and rowdy behaviour that disrupted a forum held by the bar council and threats of using the internal security act against the bar council is a desperate attempt to revive the waning political fortunes of barisan nasional
2998546 now that bn can no longer respond to charges of corruption mismanagement abuse of power and waste they are playing with fire by using religion to frighten the people
2998547 for a future prime minister to defend such extreme and rowdy behaviour is a genuine cause of concern for malaysias future as a harmonious and peaceful multi racial society that guarantees freedom of religion
2998548 it is regrettable that some members of political parties such as pas pkr and umno were involved in the almost violent demonstration
2998549 such issues and procedures if left unresolved without good mutual understanding will continue to haunt the multi religious society of malaysia
2998550 he hoped that the bar council got the message that there are certain things that are out of bounds for public discussion even if held in a private place
2998551 four members of hindraf were arrested for creating an awareness of their cause in the recent commonwealth parliamentary association conference on aug 7 but here you have over 300 protesters behaving aggressively carrying inciting banners and storming into the bar council forum raising uncalled racial sentiments against fellow malaysians without fear and protected by the police
2998552 the statement by home minister appear to be condoning such violent behavior and supporting hooliganism and claims he has not received any complaints of threat to national security or disturbance to public order is utter rubbish and nonsensical
2998553 i told him that i dont sleep around but he kept insisting on having sex with me he later loosened his belt and unzipped his trousers to expose his private parts
2998554 apparently they got the wrong information about the tickets putco buses sent out a message stating that no tickets were on sale so they could use the buses for free but someone sent out the wrong message
2998555 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
2998556 if i was independently wealthy and i didnt need an income i would do this for nothing thats how much i love it
2998557 they can be very dangerous animals if you dont know what youre doing
2998558 its very unlikely a person on a massage table is going to kick me
2998559 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2998560 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2998561 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2998562 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2998563 you told me more about the process than i know
2998564 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2998565 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2998566 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2998567 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2998568 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2998569 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2998570 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2998571 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2998572 too late but ill sublet the front corner for 25
2998573 obama is the first presidential candidate to be marketed like a high end consumer brand
2998574 i have also been advised by the lawyer and believe that because there was no detailed order of purchase so no contract existed
2998575 we will go on with what has been announced and promised
2998576 today we had a general discussion we identified areas that can give an advantage to our country
2998577 what has anwar not said negative about us he said he would move a vote of no confidence against me but nothing happened

2998682 a levels have been part of my life every summer since 1981 when i awaited the results of my first a level teaching group last year when tabitha my younger daughter took as levels i was in the difficult position of being both her mum and her headmistress i believe the student has the right to know her results first and disliked having to see them when they arrived in school the day before but there was nothing we could do about it we stuck by the rule which says no one can have their results until 6am on the day tabitha moved out and came to school to get them with everyone else it was hard for her and for me especially as i knew her grades were not quite what she had hoped for this year she has to move out of her home again and ill be in school with a big hug whatever happens because thats what mothers do i expect shell be up all night like everyone else glued to the internet to see if the universities have posted confirmation of places on the internet tabitha is aiming high and needs three a grades to read law at kings college london will she do it i really hope so i dont think she could have worked any harder her teachers are confident and she deserves it but its a tough offer and you just dont know what will happen on the day it doesnt make it any easier when you see headlines in the news saying a levels have got easier they havent theyre just different my daughter at 18 knows a lot more than i did and has done a lot more than i had at the same age in the run up to results they need all the support you can give them but on the day its important for parents to take a bit of a back seat the young person needs to be put in charge but thats not to say you dont love them and care for them and will be giving them a hug and brewing the tea the advice i give my parents which i find almost impossible to observe myself is not to treat exam results as the be all and end all your child will be fine she may not have quite the grades she wanted but she still has all the skills and attributes the grade is just a paper endorsement of what they have achieved its difficult when you have a child sobbing in your arms because they havent got the magic240 ucas points they wanted equivalent to four asat as level tabitha got an a and four bs in her as exams its hard to say it doesnt matter because it does to them with tabby we were all surprised at her grades but shes repaired it with resits it seems like a disaster on the day if you drop from a predicted a to a b or from a b to a c and students have to be reminded that these are still very good grades that a lot of people would be very glad to have they may have to take a slightly different route to get what they want but in my experience they all settle down and by the time prize giving comes along in september we have the school hall full of happy girls who have got where they want to be if you make sure they have prepared themselves for all eventualities they wont panic so much if they do miss their place one of the things parents find really hard is that universities dont deal with them nearly as well as they do with the students the student has to make the calls to the university to see if their place will be confirmed or to seek alternative courses by all means go onto the internet and see where there are places because there will be places even at russell group universities telephoning or emailing the university yourself is not necessarily going to help and may actually hinder because universities expect their future students to be able to stand on their own feet it may be that your child will want to challenge the result in which case she should get in touch with her teachers and see what they think the request has to come from the school and i would certainly recommend it when the teacher doesnt understand the mark or the grade is way off estimate weve had students who have been wrongly marked tabbys gcse history went up a grade when re marked it has to be done quickly and i cant think of an example at this school where a university has failed to honour a place when there has been a marking error ultimately the choice is theirs but you can help them to think through the reasons they applied for a course and identify the things that are important to them they will probably find other courses which meet all the same criteria my advice is to be your childs keenest supporter on the day enable them but dont try to do it for them

2998704 heavy and medium weapons roadside bombs rifles or any other kind of explosives
2998705 a couple of years ago the afghan government wanted to develop a ranger like or a special operations like structure in the military
2998706 the ana were large and laborious the ana is a good army its a developing army but they need a smaller more agile flexible force and so the commandos were the solution
2998707 signal is probably one of the most difficult things to teach the afghan recruits and lot of it goes back to previous education
2998708 its difficult to explain the background of how a radio works so we try to cut a lot of theory out of it and just take it to practical application this is how it works and this is how you should make it work
2998709 guys come in and you got lumps of clay they really dont know a lot about training and light infantry tactics
2998710 by week six theyre starting its kind of you tear them down and build them up again its the same thing theres a lot of similarities between what we experience in ranger school in the united states and what theyre experiencing here in commando school
2998711 we issue them uniforms boots helmets weapons vehicles radios everything that theyre going to need
2998712 all of this stuff here will all redeploy with them when they go

2998717 its precious forces for the afghan national army we have the best training we have the best equipment and we can conduct dangerous missions
2998718 id say the best way to describe them is theyre steadfast in their improvement theyre dedicated we really do see them as afghani patriots and i think the way ahead is pretty bright their heart is in the right place
2998719 we are doing operations in four different provinces around here
2998720 as soon as we get word that were needed we can get ready in 20 25 minutes and can stop any kind of bad activities
2998721 and i think thats why the commandos are so important
2998722 they are afghans they understand the country they understand the history they can interact with the population in a way that no outsider ever could
2998723 we may hide it in a wall or something in our own home back in the united states
2998724 the afghans know they wouldnt hide it in their house theyd keep it away because wed find it in their house so they understand the customs the way people actually do things and it assists us in our planning
2998725 insurgency and counter insurgency is an intimate struggle in the nation and ultimately it has to be an afghan fight

2998749 its hard it gets easy it gets fun again whats hard to sustain is some ideal that its perfect thats ridiculous whats fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person and looking across the room and saying im still here and i still love you you re meet reconnect you have marriages within marriages within marriages thats what i love about marriage thats what i want in marriage its unfortunate but we live in a very disposable society those moments where it looks like uh oh this isnt working those are the most important transformative moments most couples draw up divorce papers when theyre missing out on an amazing moment of deepening and enlightenment and connection
2998750 my mother who is 85 was taken from a nursing home to the hospital after having a small stroke
2998751 i met her at the hospital she was put in a bed back there in er but it was two hours before a doctor ever looked at her
2998752 nurses do what they can but they cant do anything until the doctor sees the person
2998753 my daughter suffers from migraine headaches when she was having a particularly bad one it was a sunday and her doctor wasnt in
2998754 she went to the er vomiting and so sick it was five hours before she got an iv in and she was dehydrating
2998755 our patient wait time is less than 10 minutes often three minutes before a patient sees a triage nurse and that number is going down were working on that
2998756 across the nation a lot more medicare and medicaid patients are not being seen by family doctors and are coming to emergency departments
2998757 a person brought to the hospital by ambulance or one who walks in is seen by a nurse and evaluated almost immediately
2998758 the doctor comes to them at the appropriate time in the process
2998759 the triage nurse is in communication with the doctor often tests are ordered before the doctor can evaluate the situation
2998760 we recognize that people dont always come in with complex health problems
2998761 i was there at midnight one time and the room was full people were sleeping in chairs
2998762 what we do at st josephs is use what are called protocols to start lab work x rays and ekgs so that the physician will have up to date information to evaluate the patient
2998763 we monitor door to bed time as an indication of how efficient our emergency department operates
2998764 our average wait time trends like the national average but almost one half our patients are seen in less than 30 minutes by the physician nurse practitioner or physicians assistant
2998765 the more it stays the same the less it changes
2998766 we file as a last resort to the problems we see and in this case we thought it was necessary to do this
2998767 its after we accumulate a number of problems and violations until we even consider this
2998768 presently the rules do not allow us to consider the performance of livestock operations in other states
2998769 however we do look at their performance in indiana and make sure that they are able to meet environmental rules and laws

2998777 there are weekly drive ins at the honda shop in marietta
2998778 on the thursday night ride everybody was talking about this
2998779 the vehicle went off the right side of the road struck an embankment and overturned ejecting the two occupants that were riding in the bed of the truck
2998780 one of the occupants was fatally injured the other received serious visible injuries
2998781 will ultimately result in increasing our dependence on foreign oil and hinder investment in domestic exploration
2998782 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single overarching goal in 10 years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
2998783 the development of a battery package that has the size capacity cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug in hybrids or electric cars
2998784 we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix

2998793 from 2 500 to 3 000 mercenaries fight against russias peacekeepers on behalf of georgia
2998794 we warned our partners our western partners over and over again that georgia was preparing for the aggression for solving the long standing conflict by combat means but no one heard us
2998795 we will certainly endeavor to take the peacekeeping mission to the logical conclusion
2998796 normalerweise zeige ich in einer solchen situation einfach einen guten zweiten lauf
2998797 weve learned a harsh lesson and weve certainly had it
2998798 he is an important player for the team and it does not enter our plans to sell him
2998799 i can only hope we dont make the same mistakes in the league
2998800 chief executive tony scholes is over in spain speaking to the player at the moment but that doesnt mean he will be signing for us
2998801 he is a player with great pedigree and has an outstanding goalscoring record but he isnt the only player we are looking at
2998802 we have a good player but hopefully we will have another good player coming too
2998803 i dont know when but clearly we have problems on the left
2998804 there will certainly be some changes on tuesday night but it is important that we get the balance right
2998805 obviously the league is the most important competition that we will be involved in this year but i wouldnt dream of belittling any tournament that we play in
2998806 the league is our priority but having a good run in any cup competition is beneficial
2998807 if its not working for sylvan ebanks blake or andy keogh then weve got two good options to throw on
2998808 we didnt have that last season losing the strikers we had weve got better strikers now with sam scoring on his debut and big chris being a handful
2998809 theyre good competitors who like to get in the box and score and im pleased with both
2998810 you hear about this but you never see it never
2998811 if you can love my garden gnome you can certainly love me
2998812 there is only one elvira she is the sexiest woman ive ever seen to be compared to her is truly a compliment one i will cherish for a lifetime but my work is serious and i am real through and through not an actress for show ive been this way my entire life
2998813 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
2998814 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process of course
2998815 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
2998816 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with
2998817 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2998818 since the beginning we said we were going to include everyone in this convention
2998819 considering the amount of energy and enthusiasm she generated it was obvious she would be an important part of the program
2998820 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region
2998821 the company could declare force majeure on its exports from the two ports
2998822 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

2998829 if you want to walk out of that tunnel and want people to cheer for you and respect you theres an obligation that goes with that
2998830 some people have not really understood the effort weve made and in a lot of cases have overcriticized some things that happened not that we were not wrong we were wrong
2998831 darylls done very very well and part of that is because hes played in games more than pat has
2998832 and so when he comes into preseason and does really well daryll hasnt left the door open for anyone to jump him
2998833 i think ive made it clear that i would prefer to play one quarterback
2998834 its been a huge honor to get back with my good friends the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other that doesnt mean it hadnt crossed my mind
2998835 br nn ist eine sch ne aber auch anspruchsvolle strecke
2998836 es ist ein bisschen wie mugello und phillip island zwei meiner lieblingsstrecken mit den 250ern war ich dort auf dem podium und im vergangenen jahr habe ich gewonnen das motorrad war zuletzt gut in schuss also sollten wir dort auch ein gutes ergebnis einfahren k nnen
2998837 wir m ssen noch einige punkte aufholen das wird nicht einfach aber das team arbeitet hart und wir geben alle unser bestes was dann dabei herauskommt wird man dann sehen nach dem rennen in laguna seca bin ich nach australien geflogen und habe zeit mit meiner frau und meiner familie verbracht abseits der rennstrecke ich konnte mich ausruhen aber ich habe auch trainiert ich kann es kaum noch erwarten wieder auf das bike zu steigen
2998838 ich mag br nn und habe dort mit den 125ern und den 250ern schon gewonnen
2998839 mit der motogp war ich dort noch nicht auf dem podium aber beim testen war ich immer gut es gibt einen neuen fahrbahnbelag also einen neuen faktor f r alle ich hoffe dass wir an die gute arbeit in deutschland und den usa anschlie en k nnen und dann endlich auch einmal ein ergebnis nach hause bringen
2998840 die strecke passt auf jeden fall gut zu unserer ducati daher sind die erwartungen hoch die ferien waren gut ich war erst ein paar tage in monte carlo danach bin ich nach romagna gefahren denn ich hatte meine familie seit langer zeit nicht mehr gesehen ich habe dort bei ihnen meinen geburtstag gefeiert und es war toll mal etwas entspannen zu k nnen
2998841 auf der strecke in br nn f hlt sich unsere maschine richtig heimisch
2998842 wir konnten dank bridgestone in den vergangenen beiden jahren dort gewinnen erst mit loris capirossi anm d red und dann mit casey die strecke wurde neu asphaltiert was uns allen eine unbekannte beschert wir hoffen dass der grip genauso gut ist wie im vergangenen jahr au erdem soll das wetter drei tage stabil bleiben damit wir uns gut f r das rennen vorbereiten k nnen wir sind zuversichtlich aber wir wissen auch dass der wettbewerb sehr hart wird
2998843 how can we protect conservapedia by distinguishing real conservative articles from satires written by liberals
2998844 ich denke ich bin recht gut in das jahr gestartet
2998845 ich w rde nicht sagen dass ich total zufrieden damit bin entt uscht bin ich allerdings auch nicht es sind noch vier rennen zu fahren und wir haben alle chancen noch einige gute ergebnisse zu holen
2998846 ich habe mich im vergleich zum vorjahr verbessert und fortschritte gemacht
2998847 nat rlich ndert sich die auto situation von jahr zu jahr aber ich habe besser als 2007 abgeschnitten es ist gro artig f r mich einen teamkollegen wie gary paffet zu haben zumal er ein ehemaliger meister und formel 1 testfahrer ist
2998848 wenn ich ihm auf den fersen bleiben kann dann wei ich dass ich mich am limit des fahrzeugs bewege und einen guten job mache
2998849 es war schon immer mein ziel punkte zu holen aber man muss seine chancen auch realistisch betrachten es gibt eine ganze reihe 2007er autos die schon in die punkte gefahren sind und auch ich war schon nahe dran und habe einige gute leistungen gezeigt
2998850 nat rlich will ich meisterschaftsz hler einfahren und daran arbeite ich auch
2998851 mein ziel ist es in der dtm erfolgreich zu sein und in der meisterschaft gut abzuschneiden alles weitere wird sich dann automatisch ergeben
2998852 it can be such a disappointment when you feel god leading you to start a group and then only one person shows up but from personal experience i can say that god knows what he is doing and may have planned it that way the first time i had only one woman come to a hopekeepers meeting we ended up having an amazing conversation later she disclosed that she was extremely leery about attending and probably wouldnt have spoken at all if other people had been there
2998853 jane we can relate with what you are sharing can someone else tell us how she or he has dealt with these emotions

2998875 es muy importante que el pp explique lo que est pasando porque aqu se nos dice que al gobierno no le van a apoyar los presupuestos pero gente de su propio partido y los grupos que apoyan al gobierno dicen una cosa y la contraria asever y la gente tiene derecho a saber qu va a pasar con el dinero de los contribuyentes
2998876 espero que todos nos apoyen y si no nos apoyan es evidente que algo tienen que ocultar coment pero la opini n p blica tiene derecho a saber qu piensa el presidente del gobierno del debate de financiaci n auton mica que est generando una crisis pol tica muy importante
2998877 im glad expectations are high as they should be its an honour for us to have that bestowed upon us i have worked very hard to have that kind of pressure
2998878 if there was no pressure that would mean i have no chance at a medal if there was ever a chance for me to be on top of the podium its now
2998879 because i am in the best form of my life by far and i believe that i can do it i really do
2998880 ive been having all positive images in my head now just pray for us all to maintain our good health and also a little bit of luck wouldnt hurt

2998883 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
2998884 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
2998885 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2998886 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2998887 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2998888 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2998889 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
2998890 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
2998891 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
2998892 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
2998893 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
2998894 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
2998895 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
2998896 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
2998897 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
2998898 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality
2998899 these are two people who are very popular coming together like that is extremely sad
2998900 for many of us he was a hero in his music and in the way he carried himself
2998901 his music was an inspiration for a lot of artists he showed us you can make it work
2998902 he was an institution not only for blacks but for all people
2998903 he was the black moses he took us through the exodus of music
2998904 the older stars seem to go down one by one bernie mac the godfather of soul manhattan said he used to play in a band that tried to capture hayes signature sound that made him a legend in the soul genre
2998905 i havent seen anyone else with this type of music it was specialized
2998906 of course it would have been more meaningful if i had won a medal in athens i came so close but now im only looking at the 2008 olympics thats my desire
2998907 i believe i have a chance of making the final in fact i think that we have a 200 per cent chance as i believe that azizul hasni awang will also make the final that gives a 50 per cent chance of a medal and we cant complain
2998908 azizul is a tremendous talent and i am more matured and physically stronger i believe that we have a great chance if we keep focused
2998909 thats not me i love attention and why should i deflect it to someone else but it is a fact that azizul has improved tremendously over the last year
2998910 for me this is good as there is someone to share the pressure with
2998911 i dont think we should be underestimated in the team sprint though i have to say that the french dutch and spanish are just a little ahead of us just yet
2998912 still anything can happen and who knows we may just deliver a medal
2998913 qualifying is a dream fulfilled and being the flagbearer is a tremendous honour it also means it is recognition of what i have achieved and means pressure but i believe i have prepared well in spain and am just raring to go

2998922 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2998923 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2998924 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2998925 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2998926 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2998927 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2998928 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2998929 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2998930 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac

2998935 if we assume that it would take about ten years from the day of authorization to get to peak production and that most of the oil is pumped out over 30 years this would translate into a bit over 1 million barrels of oil a day
2998936 dick cheney wrote the energy bill with the oil companies now he wants to fatten their profits when they refuse to pass the relief on to you big oil has 68 million acres to drill that they havent touched george bush and dick cheney want to give them more maybe someone should ask why george w bush and dick cheney havent given anything to you

2998939 obama and the new york liberals are mocking your patriotism and your fears mr and mrs american and they dont respect the fact that we were attacked on 9 11 and could be attacked again and are at war with people who hate us and our way of life and puppies ice cream girl scouts and christmas too
2998940 i dont suppose youve by any chance have seen the cover of the latest issue of the new yorker magazine which is you know a huge thing
2998941 ive had a lifelong dream of public service work and i think that being a circuit judge would be perfect for me
2998942 to me its so critical for the public to know that this judge will decided felony matters
2998943 i bring experience to the felony courts this judge will be sitting on the felony bench and have the responsibility of sentencing deciding whether to sign a search warrant and be deciding life or death penalties my opponent as nice and intelligent of a man as he is has never handled a felony case in his life
2998944 i have a good understanding from law school and training of the principals and procedures of the rights of the accused the rights of the witnesses and the interest of the state ill be prepared to follow all of those if elected and in the felony court as a judge
2998945 i want to provide some depth to the judiciary to help the judges in all the cases and use some of my practice in a civil law and business background
2998946 with all the budget constraints i want to give everybody the opportunity to be heard and still move the docket said mederos jacobs
2998947 its amazing a judge can dispose of them in the amount of time they do
2998948 i want to make sure all the judges no matter what division work together to cover for one another and try and move cases along better so no one judge is burdened down
2998949 sometimes i think about private practice but i enjoy shelter work this needs to be done
2998950 removing a dogs testicles makes some male owners nervous we have to approach the subject very delicately but its much better to snip the problem in the bud than have unwanted puppies

2998955 it will take someone who has been in this position with managerial skills to get the job done
2998956 that is not being adequately done thats the biggest change i would make
2998957 i think our criminal justice system is a revolving door we constantly have repeat offenders in and out of jail and a big reason why is we are not doing enough to address underlying issues they have
2998958 to get them back into the community to be productive law abiding citizens
2998959 until we break that cycle were going to continue to see the jail population explode
2998960 were facing probably the most difficult economic budget shortfall its not a time to start over
2998961 elliott has run a very lean and successful office i think i offer the experience but also the vision for change we are confronted with and the passion and energy to carry us through

2998964 lanzarote es una isla de p blico abierto a todos los estilos y es algo que tenemos muy presente a la hora de programar festivales de este tipo y darles contenido
2998965 desde siempre dibujamos en papel del papel pasamos a nuestra cama de la cama al mueble de mi madre y era normal que tuvi ramos que salir a la calle a pintar es una superficie mucho m s grande y con otro tipo de pintura pero al final estamos haciendo lo mismo
2998966 son las cajas de cart n donde se guardan los archivadores que se han pintado con plantillas que simulan ser una tape
2998967 son obras nicas que no se comercializa nicamente se exhiben en la exposici n
2998968 todo lo que sea acercar a la gente de a pie est bien lo que pasa es que el graffiti ya est cerca de la gente pues no hay nada m s cercano que salir a la calle y encontrarte una pieza le va a costar m s a la gente venir aqu que ir a la calle verlo
2998969 para nosotros es un lujo estar pintando en este tipo de superficies en un edificio hist rico
2998970 realmente la gente sabe que esto es una obra que estamos exponiendo pero en realidad estamos exponiendo muchos d as al a o en la calle y son obras que a lo mejor duran un d a nada m s
2998971 nos motiva ver a otra gente que hace graffiti la verdad a los maestros cualquier cosa que veas por ah te motiva en cualquier momento tienes una idea pero sinceramente a mi las mejores ideas me han venido trabajando cuando estas ilustrando cuando estas dibujando es cuando de repente se te ocurre una parida y decides hacerla
2998972 aunque muchas veces haya cosas que no se vean es realmente nuestra manera de exponer nuestra obra es as si quieres llevarnos a una exposici n quieres ver nuestro book ver s que est hecho con fotograf as de la calle
2998973 in the last few years and due to the advent of the google adsense web advertising program scraper sites have proliferated at an amazing rate for spamming search engines open content sites such as wikipedia are a common source of material for scraper sites
2998974 endemol has always grown through acquisitions we are in an exploratory phase we have many projects open itv is just one of many
2998975 the results suggest not all the large changes seen in arctic climate in recent years are a result of long term trends associated with global warming
2998976 given our less than predicted catastrophic sea ice loss this year coupled with this study it looks like arctic ice could be on the mend anthony larger image
2998977 our study confirms many changes seen in upper arctic ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature rather than trends caused by global warming
2998978 while some 1990s climate trends such as declines in arctic sea ice extent have continued these results suggest at least for the wet part of the arctic the arctic ocean circulation reverted to conditions like those prevalent before the 1990s
2998979 the winter of 2006 2007 was another high arctic oscillation year and summer sea ice extent reached a new minimum
2998980 it is too early to say but it looks as though the arctic ocean is ready to start swinging back to the counterclockwise circulation pattern of the 1990s again
2998981 the events of the 1990s may well be a preview of how the arctic will respond over longer periods of time in a warming world
2998982 the close agreement between the north pole pressure gauges and grace data demonstrates graces potential for tracking world ocean circulation
2998983 satellite altimeters such as nasas jason are ideal for studying ocean circulation but cant be used at earths poles due to ice cover
2998984 our results show grace can be a powerful tool for tracking changes in the distribution of mass in the arctic ocean as well as its circulation
2998985 hes fabulous hes a guy who makes tough decisions he takes charge hes ready to sacrifice his interest on behalf of the interest of the country
2998986 he does justice sometimes against insurmountable odds and he doesnt make his good works known to a lot of people
2998987 generally delivers a 3x improvement in the speed at which users can find something
2998988 thats where there is a really good return on investment we can improve the quality of the experience people go through and enable them to actually complete transactions because of the volume there you only need to increase that by a fraction of a percent and our technology is well and truly paying for itself
2998989 we index your content the content belonging to kannuus partner and enable the lookup on that content only we present the user with the most likely bit sized chunks of characters required to complete the desired lookup phrase
2998990 just say there may be someone in your address book whose name starts with a
2998991 so if the advertiser is promoting a particular item the algorithm can be influenced so those particular choices are pushed up further up the list and therefore appear earlier in the users selection process
2998992 we will make money two ways if were actually on the device itself then we sit on the actual device itself and therefore the manufacturer pays us a royalty per device that were on the other way is that we sit on the server side so if youre on say a mobile phone and youre on a web connection and youre looking at say amazon it would be amazon that would be paying for our server license to use our technology
2998993 the opportunity to be able to make more sales is there if people can easily and conveniently do a lookup on a mobile device so to me its about making it easy if you make it easy for the user theyll do it more often theyll complete more transactions therefore were making more revenue its a pretty straightforward story on that front
2998994 were moving down a path to getting kannuu into a pilot and that will be on their nokia high end phones
2998995 kannuu can work on any device that has a screen a directional control of touchscreen and the ability to index data from a database
2998996 were having some really interesting conversations right now with a couple of the major service providers in that area set top boxes there is no doubt when youre on a remote control being able to choose up down left right center is the natural with your thumb you dont need to look at the remote to do that you just need to look at the screen i think also youve got much more screen real estate than you have on a mobile device so we can do more things with our technology to make the experience even more fulfilling for the user
2998997 the popularity of the platform along with the high demand for applications gives us an amazing opportunity to connect consumers with content
2998998 yahoo and google cant take their current search metaphor that they use on the desktop and just resize that to the mobile environment theyve got to really re think it thats part of what we are is we are weve re thought what search is and what look up is when youre on a device thats got limited entry and of course the big databases thats where we really come into our own because of the way our technology works
2998999 as the list of possible results grows kannuu becomes more efficient
2999000 so as you go from say 1 000 items to 1 000 000 items on average youre only adding an extra three clicks into your search and i think everyone realizes that the trend is more data not less
2999001 we allow the content providers to take control of the full user experience rather than rely on the hardware to be the way the text is entered and the search is experienced in a way it standardizes it allowing content providers to deliver a consistent user experience regardless of the hardware
2999002 it may be previous searches it may be location and whatever the input they all have an effect on the search results that are presented this could also be influenced by other searches taking place on the network or by mobile advertising

2999004 the court ultimately came to a very very wrong conclusion
2999005 it is regrettable that a member of the national executive committee nec of the anc is publicly dismissing and denouncing free education as a pipe dream
2999006 we view these remarks as nonsensical and distasteful simply because they are clearly undermining the anc resolutions and the principle of democratic centralism
2999007 these remarks are also an attack on the continuous struggles waged by both the students and youth movements in smashing the colonial and capitalist orientated education system in our country
2999008 a reminder to our people that beneficiaries of patronage and those in high echelons of power are hell bent in undermining the gains made in polokwane including its progressive resolutions
2999009 it will be prudent that we safeguard and defend the polokwane outcomes even if it means we have to go to the streets in protest it is our contention as the ycl that the ministry of education is not an advanced english college but is a government institution which needs to conform and comply with the policies of the ruling party the anc
2999010 south africa must offer free education when it can afford it steps must be taken progressively to get to that free education
2999011 but can we say lets have free education tomorrow unfortunately the reality of the situation is that we cannot

2999020 the government would send blind children for work experience to industrial factories but i was so scared of the loud noises it really terrified me
2999021 when i lost my sight at 12 i went to a blind school which incorporated high school and medical school i learnt subjects such as brail and science and at 17 started my degree which included subjects like pharmacy traditional chinese medicine and western medicine
2999022 i had to pay for my own schooling the government didnt help but it was very cheap just 200 rmb 29 per year these days it costs about 5 000 rmb 730 a year
2999023 i was so lucky to get this chance i really love this profession i want to learn more and more if possible

2999029 he will return to india aug 14 and we are going to receive him at the airport i am anxiously waiting for that moment when i can hug him and congratulate him
2999030 it has proved to be a blessing in disguise that we did not go there i have also not talked to him for the last five days our presence at the venue could have put an unnecessary pressure on him and affect his performance
2999031 now i am just waiting for his return and then there will be a series of parties celebrations bursting of crackers and everything that i can do on this earth

2999088 after the build up i was a bit disappointed it lacked heart and soul and was a bit too robotic i think opening ceremonies have become too expensive i think the simple ceremonies of the old days like melbourne in 1956 were much more sincere and much more in keeping with what the games are really about
2999089 the olympics is about participation the money spent on such extravagant ceremonies could be used to support countries that cant afford to send athletes to the games
2999090 our study is the first to specifically examine psa screening in younger men which provides an important assessment of quality of care especially for high risk groups

2999200 spends 3 5 billion on arts funding and is spending more on arts than did the previous liberal government in the case of promart we think the funding choices made were inappropriate inappropriate because they were ideological in some cases with highly ideological individuals exposing their agendas or money going to wealthy celebrities or fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
2999201 we cut this particular program because some the things funded either questioned the status quo or offended charles mcvety oh and by the way we are better than the liberals

2999203 i could complain all day about how bad bell sympatico is run form top to bottom but a lot of it would be the fault of the call center and bells lack of communication and by bell allowing it to continue
2999204 specifically i would mention the practice of sending the first 2 non billing related calls to an indian center in new dehli before you would be directed to an agent in canada
2999205 this is obviously to discourage people from complaining escalating or getting answers since the indian reps do not really have the ability or the skills to fix any issues on the third call they are considered multi callers and put in a cue for my call center

2999209 it is regrettable that a member of the national executive committee nec of the anc is publicly dismissing and denouncing free education as a pipe dream
2999210 we view these remarks as nonsensical and distasteful simply because they are clearly undermining the anc resolutions and the principle of democratic centralism
2999211 these remarks are also an attack on the continuous struggles waged by both the students and youth movements in smashing the colonial and capitalist orientated education system in our country
2999212 a reminder to our people that beneficiaries of patronage and those in high echelons of power are hell bent in undermining the gains made in polokwane including its progressive resolutions

2999214 it is our contention as the ycl that the ministry of education is not an advanced english college but is a government institution which needs to conform and comply with the policies of the ruling party the anc
2999215 south africa must offer free education when it can afford it steps must be taken progressively to get to that free education

2999229 in none of the evidence presented did you ever see him brandishing a weapon at all even when he was captured and the evidence all showed that there was an ak 47 right there in the front seat the guys behind him and in front of him deployed weapons he bailed out of the car and ran

2999239 i thought we played clinically and we managed to score tries from that we controlled the game well in the first half and dominated in the set pieces so i knew it was only a matter of time before things started happening for us unfortunately we let them in the game in the second half but the guys did very well to grind out a win

2999305 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2999306 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2999307 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2999308 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2999309 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2999310 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2999311 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2999312 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2999313 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2999314 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2999315 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2999325 we pulled out our troops after they had completed the task of cleaning theyre out theyre out
2999326 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2999327 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2999328 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2999329 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2999330 we pulled out our troops after they had completed the task of cleaning theyre out theyre out
2999331 russia answers cease fire offer with wider assault on georgia
2999332 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
2999333 clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has escalated
2999334 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2999335 suddenly there was a massive explosion which hit a house down the road from us
2999336 our windows shattered and i jumped for cover i grabbed my son and wife and ran down to the basement where i was joined by dozens of other civilians the bombing only got worse it was relentless and went on for hours i never thought it would come to this georgians bombing us not in my wildest imagination
2999337 georgian snipers are taking down anything that moves even outside the towns hospital which is making it hard to deliver the wounded they are not sparing anyone
2999338 houses are being hit around us by rockets we have no food but its too dangerous to go out
2999339 there were bodies lying everywhere in the streets around ruined buildings in cars there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2999340 grad missiles are falling they are taking the city we are running out of ammunition wheres our f ing help
2999341 it all happened so quickly suddenly we were in the middle of heavy fighting i saw our neighbours house get a direct hit i took cover with the kids in the basement it was terrifying
2999342 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2999343 i was in the hospital on friday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet
2999344 russia will not close its eyes on the deaths of russian citizens in south ossetia
2999345 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us in one strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
2999346 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings
2999347 the flights are ongoing to redeploy the elements of the georgian contingent so that they can deal with the security issues in their country
2999348 we can accommodate that obviously it was not expected but it is something the effects of which we can certainly mitigate
2999349 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
2999350 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
2999351 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2999352 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2999353 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2999354 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2999355 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2999356 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2999357 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
2999358 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
2999359 as president mikheil saakashvili deflowers his own revolution and shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
2999360 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted some restrictions and called new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
2999361 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the new cold war
2999362 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
2999363 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2999364 he will be dearly missed by many but we take comfort in the fact that he loved the lord lived life to the fullest with no regrets and died doing something he loved

2999382 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2999383 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2999384 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2999385 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2999386 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2999387 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2999388 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2999389 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2999396 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth now the earth proved to be formless and waste and there was darkness upon the surface of the watery deep and gods active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters
2999397 the spirit of god was moving over the surface of the waters
2999398 and gods active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters
2999399 and i will pour out on the house of david and the inhabitants of jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication they will look on me the one they have pierced and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son
2999400 they will look upon the one whom they have pierced

2999627 its becoming almost like an arms race as to who can ban more things
2999628 san francisco bans plastic bags then la bans plastics then everyone else has to its ironic because the us was founded as a reaction to the colonists telling them what to do i mean hey when are we gonna start banning alcohol again
2999629 we are taking a strong step toward creating a healthier future for california
2999630 the government here in california is banning a food product simply because its not healthy

2999810 trimming foreign reserves equals reducing debt so they should think about steps including selling foreign reserve assets to markets in the future
2999811 one way to do it is to sell the same amount of foreign reserves every month no matter what happens while fully disclosing its plans
2999812 the best timing would be when bearishness on the dollar disappears and the market does not feel antipathy toward japanese sales of its reserves

2999817 i still dont know what i did wrong before my last round i did the exact same preparation i probably started trying too hard
2999818 i wanted to be canadas first medal of the games because i heard today going out on the bus that we hadnt won a medal yet
2999819 everybody asked me what do you think of this one compared to 1984 but 1984 was in l a so not many people were there
2999820 today here i feel like im back home everybody calling me name they still remember me im so happy to be here in beijing
2999821 brents lead off time really charged us up for swimming fast

2999823 playing against italy was a tough draw but we shot well together
2999824 at one point we had a four point lead and kept shooting strong which made italy have to really step up their game
2999825 with the male dancers there is a novelty factor which attracts audience
2999826 down south there are a number of male dancers even today who take up dancing as a profession
2999827 almost every family down south is into some kind of art and thus have a very different thinking though i have seen male dancers finding it difficult to get shows as a number of organisers have a mindset that female dancers draw more crowds
2999828 male and female dance forms have always co existed however with women from educated background taking to dance even the traditional male dance forms were invaded kathak which was a male dominated dance forms now sees women in large numbers
2999829 i was simply mad about music and dance since childhood my father was not very happy seeing all this and i had to struggle a lot initially to take up dancing as a profession
2999830 my father thought that it was a low caste profession and that i would not have any future in this field but i still decided not to give up when your inner urge says that you have to do something nothing can stop you and without even caring for my future i just went ahead in the pursuit of my passion
2999831 the it and the bpo sector is what offers quick returns in comparison dance does not yield adequate monetary gains that is why parents think twice before sending their child to train as a dancer but the boys from the gharanas those who hail from traditional dance families are still very much into this field
2999832 naika doesnt have to do anything with gender naika doesnt mean she but is just a principle
2999833 when i learnt dance or when i teach the same right from the word go i dont concentrate on the gender aspect i took up dance because i love dance period
2999834 i am not restricted to just one person and then give it up when i want
2999835 right now i am totally fascinated by the projection of the devi in mythology and want to work on something related to that
2999836 i am fascinated by the shiva parvati lila right now and like to perform them shiva is a majestic dancer and i have always wanted to bring out the shiva tandavas in their proper way
2999837 every man has female qualities and vice versa and this aspect of their performance should be restricted to the stage itself in dance it should be the feelings of the character that must be portrayed to perfection but it shouldnt go beyond that
2999838 i see the fraternity growing and male dancers today are far more serious than their counterparts a few years back a whole new crop of male dancers is coming up
2999839 the world of dance is like a big ocean and one has to put in a lot of hard work there are no shortcuts to success in this field and you need to be original
2999840 he had a very fulfilling career within the toronto fire services and will certainly be missed by the department and certainly as a valued member of our association
2999841 crews as they did their training would fill out these computer forms which would then track what training theyd done over the course of the year
2999842 he was one of those kinds of guys who accommodates you so if you have a request hell try to fulfill that request
2999843 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment
2999844 i wanted that banana so badly not just for me but for my teammates and the united states of america i share this with them

2999865 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
2999866 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
2999867 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
2999868 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
2999869 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
2999870 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2999871 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2999872 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2999873 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
2999874 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
2999875 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2999876 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
2999877 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia

2999882 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2999883 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2999884 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2999885 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2999900 every director from china has a measurement in their head
2999901 the first question when you see a screenplay is not whether its good or bad its if i can shoot the film and pass the censor if it cannot pass any effort of money you put into it will be a waste
2999902 the creator has heard your prayers and will answer them select one among you who will serve as the messenger to the gods and he will be taken up to the heavens he will not even need to speak his wishes the creator already knows them
2999903 i would go but the journey may be long and i have other responsibilities here
2999904 i would go but i am so small the creator might not even see me
2999905 let us send buzzard he is both noble and patient
2999906 buzzard turn around buzzard turned around and where there had been nothing before now there were hundreds of beautiful suits of feathers hanging from pegs on the vast walls of the lodge each different from the next
2999907 here are the suits of feathers i have made for the bird people as their messenger you have the honor of selecting for your own the suit you like the best those you do not choose will fall to earth and become the clothing of the other birds
2999908 this suit of feathers is very beautiful but as messenger to the gods i need something more colorful he took off that suit and let it fall the suit passed through the cloud floor of the lodge and drifted down to earth robin caught it and put it on
2999909 sexy twinkle in her eye and a british stiff upper lip
2999910 il roveto ardeva nel fuoco ma quel roveto non si consumava
2999911 rebecca has her best event the 800m to come and the relay team will be buzzing with confidence now
2999912 this gives me and jo great confidence going into the relay our team is looking amazing
2999913 the 800m is a different event and i dont know what is going to happen but this british swimming team is amazing and i think there will be more medals this week
2999914 some people will say this is the legacy of bill sweetenham but it is not
2999915 it is the legacy of the hard work put in by adlington and her coach bill furniss
2999916 in fact becky may well have had better results in the world championships last year if she had been able to do the training that her coach felt was right for her
2999917 if you have someone constantly saying do this do that thats not right it can shatter your confidence
2999918 its a case of too many cooks spoil the broth
2999919 our relay team was in turmoil it was a nightmare
2999920 no one knew how to qualify to make sure they were in the four no one knew what order to swim in and one girl was told one week before that she wasnt going to swim she was devastated and then it turned out we needed her
2999921 in fact i cant help but have a pang of envy and wish the team i was on was this team because they are really enjoying themselves
2999922 sweetenham had a theory that if you were smiling you werent trying hard enough but now the guys are relaxed and i believe you are seeing the results
2999923 sweetenham took a lot of flak but he shook things up and secured lottery funding
2999924 weve now had more funding into the sport for coaches facilities its taken that long to see the benefits
2999925 he did give everyone a kick up the backside he did not have man management skills but michael does so between them the pair of given us what we have got today
2999926 its the most emotional swimming meeting ive been in since adrians gold and this eclipses it
2999927 the whole team is absolutely buzzing over it its mind blowing
2999928 looking back in the last 20 years weve had four womens finalists full stop and all of a sudden youve got a gold and a bronze
2999929 i wasnt sure if she had got it until that moment and then i came from behind my cushion and hit the roof
2999930 she said she was just going to have fun with it and warm up for the 800m and see what she could do
2999931 its just a bit scary and thats the word her coach uses a lot about becky when she is on form what she can do is scary
2999932 the last 20 metres were absolutely wonderful becky we were all absolutely stunned
2999933 shes just won a gold medal at her first olympics and she knows she needs to get herself down a bit to work for the relay and 800m she is just so professional and dedicated
2999934 as her mum i am just so proud as i know she can handle it and wont get carried away by it
2999935 she has lots of friends in the relay team and she will really want to do well by them which is good as it will mean she wont think too much about the 800m
2999936 its taken far too long for this to happen so well done champ
2999937 il roveto ardeva nel fuoco ma quel roveto non si consumava
2999938 it is a bunch of these terrific actors getting together and having a good time its that kind of thing
2999939 abhinav has been training hard abroad for the past three months he underwent tough physical and mental training it has been a tale of sweat extremely hard work he kept himself going in pressure conditions and that has made abhinav a real champion today he fought back his back problem and we put him through a commando type of training which has given a good result
2999940 we are really feeling on top of the world at the moment we are planning big celebrations once he comes back
2999941 god has been really kind to us i had sent a sms to abhinav in the morning wishing him good luck
2999942 he has been working hard and has always remained focused on what he has been doing his olympic gold medal winning achievement has not come easy as he has made a lot of sacrifice to reach the top and taste this victory
2999943 ya lo esperaba porque ya las hab a visto y conozco c mo ella pueden jugar y c mo podemos jugar nosotros se que hay una gran diferencia
2999944 she wore a traditional wedding gown while ty wore his favorite blue jeans white shirt and cowboy hat
2999945 the couple is very happy and look forward to enjoying their honeymoon
2999946 we dont know if theres a point weve lapped our friends whove gotten married and divorced
2999947 we probably would if we had kids were just not sure we want them yet but weve had something really special already
2999948 its different than birkdale the british but i know i love the idea of the back nine in a major on a sunday
2999949 i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major i actually struggle when things are comfortable
2999950 it was very evident that when i won i was so focused on what i was doing the high of it i turned around saw sergio and could see the sheer disappointment
2999951 it wasnt the same as carnoustie i think maybe it got away from him at 16
2999952 thursday an opening 71 my game was going downhill quickly and i couldnt get to the clubhouse fast enough

2999955 michaels not going to be able to walk right back into the nfl huyghue said
2999956 hes going to need some kind of buffer before he signs in the nfl and well be able to provide that for him
2999957 if youre a third team quarterback in the nfl like basanez he said
2999958 if the whole world does not stop russia then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2999959 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2999960 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2999961 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2999962 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2999963 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2999964 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2999965 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2999966 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2999967 we are under attack because we never wanted to accept the old corrupt rules of the game we wanted to be close to the west
2999968 an ideal time to attack a small country a very well planned provocation
2999969 it took the courage of ronald reagan to reverse the soviet adventures
2999970 we are receiving reports that a police of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2999971 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2999972 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
2999973 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2999974 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2999975 come to the edge he said they said we are afraid come to the edge he said they came he pushed them and they flew
2999976 i support my fellow leader in principle though i reserve the right to adjust the implementation plans as necessary

2999979 no let me give you fight this morning abi your fowl born lizard for you
2999980 i go destroy your papa for here and nothing dey happen
2999981 as you see me so i be like person wey come count bridge for lagos
2999982 it was not an unreasonable calculation to go for a rapid win but in the end it was a miscalculation
2999983 the capital tskhinvali is relatively small no more than around 25 000 people and they probably thought they could just take it and be done
2999984 they may have calculated that some people would leave the region and flee north to north ossetia but the rest would stay and the problem would basically be resolved
2999985 the russians have been provoking for a long time and i dont doubt that they stoked up the separatists to start attacking
2999986 at the same time if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily and at this stage it seems uncertain that they will stop
2999987 if the russians hadnt intervened and georgia had taken over some south ossetians would have fled but most probably would have been okay and south ossetia probably would have been better off economically and culturally
2999988 consternado por el desproporcionado uso de la fuerza por parte de rusia y la falta del respeto por la integridad territorial de georgia
2999989 there have been no schools built in their entirety from new since the complete ban on asbestos in 1999
2999990 our aim and that of schools is to help all children do the best they can tests are simply tools which can help teachers achieve that
2999991 we need to create an environment in schools that reflects the importance of science and the value of studying it
2999992 robots cant teach the only effective teaching is by breathing living teachers who can look a pupil in the eye and respond to them
2999993 its clear that consumer want a strong voice in the conversation with the marketer adlife will enable consumer participation and social influence inside the billions of impressions received by traditional digital ad units like banner ads
2999994 os bancos demoram entre 15 e 30 dias para fornecer os extratos esse um prazo mais do que suficiente para fornec los
2999995 dia 30 de dezembro um prazo de seguran a quem entrar com a o at essa data n o ter problemas pois o banco n o poder argumentar a prescri o do prazo
2999996 na maioria dos casos os advogados cobram os honor rios em percentual do dinheiro a ser obtido
2999997 como se o dinheiro continuasse depositado todo esse tempo recebendo o mesmo que a poupan a
2999998 there is no russian military attack there is peace enforcement in south ossetia
2999999 along with military aggression the russian federation is blocking georgian internet portals
