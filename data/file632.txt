6320020 no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship place or ministry whatsoever nor shall be enforced restrained molested or burthened in his body or goods nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief but that all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion and that the same shall in no wise diminish enlarge or affect their civil capacities
6320021 question with boldness even the existence of a god because if there be one he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blind folded fear
6320022 as to jesus of nazareth my opinion of whom you particularly desire i think the system of morals and his religion as he left them to us the best the world ever saw or is likely to see but i apprehend it has received various corrupting changes and i have with most of the present dissenters in england some doubts as to his divinity though it is a question i do not dogmatize upon having never studied it and think it needless to busy myself with it now when i expect soon an opportunity of knowing the truth with less trouble i see no harm however in its being believed if that belief has the good consequences as probably it has of making his doctrines more respected and observed especially as i do not perceive that the supreme takes it amiss by distinguishing the unbelievers in his government of the world with any peculiar marks of his displeasure
6320023 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
6320024 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
6320025 whenever we read the obscene stories the voluptuous debaucheries the cruel and torturous executions the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the bible is filled it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of god it is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind
6320026 the question before the human race is whether the god of nature shall govern the world by his own laws or whether priests and kings shall rule it by fictitious miracles
6320027 the day will come when the mystical generation of jesus by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin will be classed with the fable of the generation of minerva in the brain of jupiter

6320031 we expect to reach 500 million opensocial users by the end of the quarter its also very international as social networking is a global phenomenon
6320032 when we launched opensocial javascript was the center but the community wants more choice we agreed upon a restful api that gives access to the social bits and is already implemented in
6320033 hi5 launched with opensocial very early january 1 2008 and we ended up building the system which had a lot of undefined pieces
6320034 we had a lot of custom work with the rest endpoint so that applications could contact our server directly as time went by all participants came up with one offs but now we are bringing it all together in the community with common types of solutions for these problems standardizing on a single specification will allow application developers to write code once and it will work on all different containers we are already seeing others build on rest specification plaxo for example has enabled privacy enabled exchange of contact info

6320054 we have to hold the test on the same day throughout the state for admissions to graduate level courses in disciplines like medicine engineering and agricultural sciences

6320057 this is truly the bandwidth olympics that we had anticipated with broadcasters requiring added bandwidth to support the high definition television broadcasts as well as the thousands of hours of streaming video broadcasts
6320058 by providing the bandwidth that is enabling this vastly expanded online coverage we expect this olympics to set a new record in terms of the number of online viewers surpassing that of the athens 2004 olympic games add to this the millions of user generated video clips from the audience that are being uploaded on video sharing web sites and it should come as no surprise that this will be the most watched olympics ever
6320059 supporting the communication needs of the olympics was one of the key considerations for landing eac c2c into qingdao
6320060 our next generation network currently supports the broadcast and communications channels across the 37 olympic venues carrying ip based video streams high definition television broadcasts as well as provisioning high speed internet access
6320061 additionally with eac c2c having dual landing points into china we offer the diverse paths and the capacity to provision more capacity if necessary
6320062 the capacity on eac c2c has already lent to the successful broadcast of the opening ceremony of the beijing 2008 olympics on 8 august 2008
6320063 our capacity will also play a critical role in the broadcasting of the closing ceremony on 24 august 2008 which we expect to be just as well watched and hence demand similar capacity requirements
6320064 si licenzia gente da 1500 euro al mese ma i manager inefficienti vengono ricoperti doro
6320065 c un clima che non mi piace si licenzia gente che guadagna 1500 euro al mese mentre manager che non hanno brillato nella gestione delle aziende tornano a casa ricoperti doro
6320066 non mi stancher mai di ribadirlo il sindacato non difende fannulloni e lavoratori scorretti che peraltro danneggiano prima di tutto i propri colleghi abbiamo ben chiaro qual il giusto equilibrio tra rivendicazione dei diritti e rispetto dei doveri cos come lesigenza di lasciarci alle spalle ogni esperienza di sindacato consociativo ma ora ci troviamo di fronte ad un clima esagerato come a voler scaricare sui lavoratori la responsabilit delle cose che non vanno nel paese e che nel caso delle fs sono una politica generale del trasporto sbagliata linefficienza dei servizi lassenza di trasferimenti da parte dello stato la minaccia della concorrenza
6320067 se stato alterato il rapporto tra ore lavorate e timbratura del cartellino si tratta di uninfrazione grave passibile di licenziamento se invece i lavoratori hanno solo chiesto ai colleghi di timbrare al posto loro il cartellino ma senza assentarsi dal lavoro allora si tratta di un caso che andrebbe affrontato con sanzioni meno pesanti
6320068 l qualcosa evidentemente non torna come dimostrano anche le reazioni degli schieramenti politici e degli osservatori imparziali come fanno cipolletta e moretti a parlare di lesione dellimmagine dellazienda quando i veri problemi sono altri che dire allora della pulizia dei treni e delle inefficienze del servizio come si fa a licenziare una persona che magari esagerando non fa altro che difendere gli interessi degli utenti e se poi accade un incidente che fine fa davvero limmagine dellazienda la linea adottata dai vertici delle fs inverte causa ed effetto ed controproducente anche se mi sembra dettata dalla voglia di spostare lattenzione dai problemi reali
6320069 guardi le fs sono passate nel giro di pochi anni da 200mila a meno di 100mila dipendenti e stata la pi grande ristrutturazione aziendale nella storia del paese ed stata fatta con il consenso del sindacato se ora lesigenza quella di diffondere il pi possibile la cultura del dovere mi chiedo perch non si cerchi un rapporto positivo con i sindacati piuttosto che risolvere il tutto sul fronte degli attacchi individuali
6320070 gi ho detto come la penso sul ruolo del sindacato nella lotta ai fannulloni e alle irregolarit daltro canto nella pubblica amministrazione i licenziamenti di lavoratori per giusta causa ci sono sempre stati senza che nel paese si scatenassero particolari dibattiti ma ora esiste un clima generale alimentato da anni di campagna ideologica contro la pubblica amministrazione motivata in fondo dagli interessi di chi vuole mettere in discussione i servizi pubblici a partire dalla sanit e dalla scuola
6320071 non abbiamo chiuso gli occhi e evidente che esistono sacche di inefficienza e forti esigenze di modernizzazione ma mi sembra che brunetta abbia lisciato il pelo a questo comune sentire usando per strumenti indifferenziati che penalizzano anche chi ha sempre fatto il proprio dovere cio la stragrande maggioranza dei lavoratori ci sono dipendenti pubblici che negli ultimi anni non hanno mai fatto un giorno di assenza per malattia e che se lo fanno ora si vedono decurtare lo stipendio
6320072 e vero lesecutivo tende a minimizzare ma sar un autunno difficile dopo la pubblicazione dei pessimi dati sul pil nella ue molti governi europei hanno interrotto le ferie per riunioni durgenza sulle contromisure da adottare di fronte alla crisi il nostro invece non ha dato segni di vita davanti ai venti di recessione dimostra che lunica cosa che gli sta a cuore il federalismo mi dispiace anche per lenfasi dimostrata dal ministro sacconi per i dati sullaumento delle ore di straordinario determinato dalla defiscalizzazione in realt il vero problema lo spaventoso incremento delle ore di cassa integrazione nelle aziende il fatto che le misure del governo nel breve periodo hanno effetti depressivi perch non sostengono i redditi e gli investimenti oltre a tagliare fondi per settori chiave come la ricerca e linnovazione
6320073 non ho problemi se lui l per fare uno show ma credo che dopo la finale dei 100 non si sarebbe dovuto lasciar andare a quei gesti anzi avrebbe dovuto mostrare pi rispetto per i suoi avversari magari andandoli a cercare per stringere loro la mano
6320074 capisco la gioia ma avrebbe potuto interpretarla in un altro modo
6320075 sembrava dire ai suoi avversari provate a prendermi se potete almeno cos stato percepito queste cose non si fanno ma imparer ancora giovane
6320076 mi piacerebbe che dimostrasse maggior rispetto verso i suoi avversari non cos che la gente immagina un campione
6320077 i dont want it but if i have to then do it cleanly and pay me

6320139 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy

6320206 take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven
6320207 every good man has his guardian angel as many of the jews believed but that the angels were in general the guards of his followers and aided them and watched over them
6320208 some have imagined that every particular saint has a guardian angel but why should we suppose this when we are sure that every particular saint when there is occasion has a guard of angels
6320209 and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha
6320210 the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them
6320211 for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways

6320401 thaksin is a criminal who ran away from the justice system he does not deserve to carry a thai diplomatic passport
6320402 i think given the spirit of the mou memorandum of understanding which up front stated that within the spirit of the agreement no party was going to convene parliament or formulate a cabinet before an agreement is signed moving to swear in parliament is in part a breach of the memorandum of understanding however we need to make a qualification there that the contestation in the talks right now is not about the swearing in of parliament is in dispute but i think the most critical point which zanu pf and president robert mugabe moves beyond that he would be crossing the rules is assembling the cabinet
6320403 assembling cabinet will actually be vesting authority in institutions and i think that will amount to be in total breach of the negotiating process and by extension it will undermine the talks
6320404 the opposition has no problem in the opening of parliament insofar as the swearing in of parliament comes in from the results of the march 29 elections which by and large the mdc has actually stated that it reflects the will of the people what the bone of contention is based on the march 29 elections which leads to the swearing in of parliament the assembly of cabinet put mugabe in a position where he uses the june 27 results that he would use for vesting himself as the president to assemble a cabinet and that is where the dispute is and that is where it will undermine the talks and the spirit of the mou
6320405 when you read the mou it states that before the agreement is signed parliament and cabinet should not be sworn in and the cabinet should not be assembled but i think the mou was based not only on an understanding but also on an assumption by the facilitator that by then they would have rapped up the deal and there would have been a concrete deal on the table and all the parties would have signed up to it so i think this issues have been long drawn and it is a long haul and there is no signature appended to this process by all the parties it actually brings into question the issue of a breach of the memorandum of understanding which says parliament and cabinet shouldnt have been assembled
6320406 i think the move is meaningless for the simple reason that what he can only get from there is that is how the issues of the speaker of our parliament is going to be nominated i think that is where the only leverage is but the battleground is the cabinet

6320452 weve raised questions throughout the process particularly in relation to the implications to the nonproliferation treaty
6320453 it is a very important document for the u s and india
6320454 it would be no secret that we would like to see more conditionalities around the agreement
6320455 a lot of people have raised questions and many people think the civil nuclear deal does not fit into the nonproliferation framework that is not our view

6320459 the natural progression of this addiction is that it pushes people to financial distress beyond anything they ever conceived
6320460 these are people who were crime free prior to their gambling addiction where on a scale of crime went from zero to 360
6320461 they tend to be people in positions of trust where they took advantage of opportunities when they were desperate and totally irrational

6320616 we had a student center where all the athletes came in and did our papers and i would see dawn in there all the time she was good friends with one of my best friends on the football team and i knew her through that i was happy for her
6320617 then im going to be waiting for the weekend because im going to crash during that time
6320618 the only pitchers i wouldnt spot start against the mariners pitch for the mariners

6320621 hes obviously not happy with what happened it doesnt matter if i win six games or 20 games if we have success as a team thats the biggest thing thats whats important to us weve had a good run lately except for the stretch in houston and we bounced back from that so keep it going

6320625 we cannot spell out names at this juncture as the probe against these four trusts is in the preliminary stage and we are yet to get concrete evidence against them
6320626 in most cases we have received complaints either directly from the borrowers or from aggrieved individuals associated with the trust in certain cases the local police stations inform us after the borrower concerned lodges a complaint of being harassed by the temple hired goons
6320627 experts said it was impossible and we were pretty surprised ourselves when it worked
6320628 i think everyone loves the novelty of a robot that can pour beer weve had a few bartenders who have said with this guy on the scene my jobs in danger but given that he costs 1 00 000 rs 81 lakh approx to make it may be a while before that happens
6320629 hes been pretty reliable so far its just a matter of making sure the beer cooler is on and that hes booted up properly before serving
6320630 is the worlds largest producer of coal steel and cement
6320631 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6320632 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6320633 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6320634 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6320635 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6320636 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6320637 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6320638 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6320639 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6320640 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6320641 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6320642 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6320643 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable

6320649 well what a stroke of luck i am heading there too how very odd
6320650 hi mj i am mary very pleased to meet you
6320651 na not really well not the axe murdering bit anyway
6320652 so i guess there is not much chance to get the horn with a capital h while hiking round the inca trail
6320653 i must say i am surprised a young good looking man like you and no special lady to call your own
6320654 trading since the end of june has been solid nevertheless the group is mindful of the likelihood that trading in some of its markets may become still more challenging over the coming months
6320655 to realign its cost base in those markets where medium term demand is expected to remain subdued whilst also keeping market developments under close watch to promptly implement additional pre prepared contingency measures should these become appropriate
6320656 acquisition activity in the second half of the year will be materially lower than the first half thereby helping to ensure that debt levels remain comfortable
6320657 whatever concerns anyone may have had that this might become some clever way to undermine the rights protected under roe v wade have i think been addressed
6320658 unless someone attempts to disrupt this effort by dragging the abortion debate back into it i have little doubt that it will be passed without much controversy
6320659 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
6320660 i told the proponents that the bill simply wasnt ever going to get through as long as there was suspicion that it was a back door way to get at roe v wade or criminalize abortion in illinois
6320661 i told the proponents just give us some extra language that will establish a comfort level for the pro choice community
6320662 they said it wasnt acceptable they said the feds didnt need those kinds of words why did we need it
6320663 it wasnt necessary the bill would have passed without it pro abort legislators needed a reason to support it in the face of mounting pressure and added those 2 redundancies to save face
6320664 obama held born alive on march 6 2003 from even being voted on in committee it is also important to note from the docket that on march 13 2003 obama stopped the senate sponsor from adding the lately discussed clarification paragraph from the federal baipa to make the bills absolutely identical
6320665 obama as chairman of the committee that vetted illinois version in 2003 refused to allow an amendment rendering both concluding paragraphs identical he also refused to call the bill and killed it
6320666 illinois prosecutors and officials with the ill dept of public health are hereby enjoined from initiating any prosecution including but not limited to criminal proceedings or imposing any sanction for violation of or enforcing in any way any of certain defined the provisions of the illinois abortion law of 1975 against any physician offering or performing abortions or pregnancy terminations
6320667 given that the bottom line is that the bill has only passed when its critics are satisfied that its utterly meaningless this doesnt seem like a particularly substantive debate over whether or not he wants to kill living infants
6320668 researchers have speculated that tumors give off different odors but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odors
6320669 a different profile of chemicals above tumor sites relative to healthy skin the same chemicals are present but at skin cancer sites some chemicals are increased while others are decreased compared to healthy individuals
6320670 open doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odors hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6320671 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate postrace competitive analysis
6320672 it called for a serious reaction on our part and we think the penalty speaks to that
6320673 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6320674 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6320675 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6320676 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6320677 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6320678 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6320679 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6320680 they want to know what were going to do about it
6320681 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6320682 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6320683 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6320684 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6320685 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6320686 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6320687 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6320688 is that our red post box or is it a real one
6320689 i usually give you all one or two tone words when we have a meeting like this but if i were to give you two words this time they would be euros lyn
6320690 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6320691 islington councils trading standards are aware of sos master tickets and are in the process of carrying out an investigation into their activity
6320692 so far there have been more than 300 complaints to the national consumer direct helpline
6320693 the website has been up for four or five months
6320694 we alerted the authorities to this some months ago because the prices they were offering for tickets were simply not achievable
6320695 they were offering a weekends camping at these festivals for 200 and that is not a realistic figure
6320696 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6320697 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6320698 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6320699 ajith speaks less on the sets but is very friendly people may speak badly about him at his back only when they interact with him they would understand that he is a matured human being
6320700 he speaks from his heart and never hides any facts a man of integrity he is an actor youngsters can emulate
6320701 by the time i was out the director had my scenes ready to be shot
6320702 his character in the film is of a violent police officer capable of completing the task entrusted to him and required a beard for the tough look
6320703 it is also something very different from the rest of his films
6320704 i have refused 13 film offers just to work with aegan and with ajith it has been my dream to work with stars like ajith and i am very happy about it
6320705 nearly 300 screens that released kuselan in tamilnadu who have paid attractive mgs has suffered huge losses we paid huge mgs as director p vasu producers kavithalaya and seven arts assured us that it was a full length rajinikanth film but we were conned by them
6320706 we have asked mr rajinikanth to intervene and request the producers to pay us for the losses and settle the matter amicably there is a precedent to it as he compensated all of us when baba failed
6320707 you keep on saying you will enter politics but why are you hesitating
6320708 i was just saying a dialogue written by a script writer in one of my films what can i do if you treat them as real and expect me to enter politics
6320709 why are you doing films with heroines half your age
6320710 when rajini sir realized his fans were let down by the dialogue he expressed his anguish to me so i immediately had the scenes removed
6320711 as of now kuuselan is a hit the fate of a film how big it is can be known only after 10 days of its release the film has collected rs 20 crore at the box office till now its too early to tell but we expect it to make decent profits
6320712 kuuselan is not an action oriented film the film has no villain no styles that are usually associated with superstar rajinikanth this film focuses on family viewing and i think it will work
6320713 accolades are pouring from all quarters for my performance in kuuselan
6320714 all credit to p vasu sir who considered me the apt choice for the role
6320715 since i had to do the same role i had no tension enacting it
6320716 it was a dream come true experience for me to share the screen with rajinikanth sir beginning with anbulla rajnikanth i have acted in six films with the super star so far
6320717 appreciation for my performance is pouring in from various quarters i consider this the greatest moment of my life
6320718 i want to choose only the right scripts only those films which have a challenging role for me would appease me
6320719 i prayed to god that if the movie kuuselan is successful i will be visiting thirupathi as the prayer is heard by the lord i am happy and to keep up the promise given to god i am here
6320720 robo shooting is starting shortly i will be in us for the same
6320721 in this film thalaivar has played a very mature age appropriate role the film highlights the beauty of friendship and has a very nice message
6320722 he has done something different in the last three films in chandramukhi he played an unconventional role of a psychiatrist shivaji was a true rajini film in kuuselan again he underplays
6320723 there is not even one action sequence in the film but he still pulls it off thats the rajinikanth magic the climax is very touching
6320724 when i said we have to kick udaikkanum those in karnataka opposing supply of water to tamil nadu i was referring to those who indulged in violence and not everyone in general yes i should have been more specific
6320725 i have been quoted as saying that i have learnt my lesson well life is all about learning
6320726 i believe rajini did not apologize he only expressed regret i think we should all forget it and let bygones be bygones
6320727 it is a very selfish act by rajinikanth aimed at releasing his kuuselan in karnataka mr rajinikanth has let us all down he must clarify his apology to the people of tamilnadu who have made him a super star today
6320728 he has taken into consideration the welfare of the films producers and distributors
6320729 i wouldnt appeal for an apology for i couldnt see anything wrong in those statements if i am in rajinikanths position i would happily compensate my producers and distributors from my own pocket rather than apologise to them his u turn is a disgrace not just to him but also to his fans
6320730 rajnikant has grown in stature by tendering the apology we have no reason to stop the film now
6320731 i have not forgotten that i was a bus conductor in bangalore at one time
6320732 had i mentioned that my remarks on the kannadigas do not apply for people in karnataka general and only to the miscreants this issue wouldnt have cropped up
6320733 i have been watching the issue for some time now and did not comment on it since i did not want to add fuel to the fire in my opinion rajini did not apologize and has only expressed regret over the issue
6320734 apologizing and expressing regret are two different things i would appeal to friends of tamil cinema not to build a dividing wall inside the community by raising such issues let the bygones be bygones
6320735 i had written a letter to the karnataka film chamber of commerce concerning the release of kuuselan i had requested their cooperation in releasing the film it was then brought to my attention that some kannada organizations are demanding my apology when i said that miscreants should be thrashed i was referring to only those burning buses and damaging public property in no way did i indicate anyone else when protests were being held in hosur road i personally saw damage to public property being inflicted by the miscreants but they did not belong to any organization i have great regard for the kannada people im neither an orator nor a politician so naturally there may be errors this will not happen again i have learnt a new lesson from the kannadigas kindly cooperate in releasing kuuselan in karnataka you fight for the cause of kannada i will be only too happy to cooperate with you i used to be a bus conductor before ive risen to name and fame now but i never forget my humble beginnings what should not have happened has happened from now on i will be extra careful when i speak so as not to hurt anyones sentiments
6320736 by tendering his apology rajinikanth has revealed his modesty and large heart so we are withdrawing protests against release of kuuselan we will no more hinder release of kuuselan in karnataka
6320737 by expressing his regret rajnikant has showed his greatness we no longer oppose the release
6320738 it is going to be a smooth screening for kuuselan
6320739 it was a mistake i have learnt a big lesson whats important is that the mistake is not repeated i will be careful while speaking in future and see that i dont hurt anybody
6320740 the matter has been resolved and we will screen the film tomorrow there has been a lot of interest and enquiries that have poured in
6320741 for 15 days acting if this movie as a guest choopper took 23 crores from our pocket then by what means we can market the movie and recover that 230 million do you think we can make the money by placing pasupathy or meenas photo ask him to take 1 million and return back 229 million rupees so that we will start giving importance to pasu and meena
6320742 this incident has taught me a lesson i shall never commit such a mistake ever again please allow the release of kuuselan in karnataka
6320743 we are told he is coming here secretly for some of his personal work if he publicly visits bangalore our volunteers are sure to question him about his remark on the hogenakal issue says gowda
6320744 its the real rajnikanth in the name of ashok kumar that you will see
6320745 its an excellent movie im surprised at how well the movie has turned out congratulations
6320746 the vibe of the city currently is kuuselan and we at big 92 7 fm would like to make our on air and on ground offering highly interactive and interesting for the listeners and this mobile photo exhibition is just another life kondadalam offering from big 92 7 fm
6320747 the best part of working in kuuselan was to again have rajini sir play a guest role in my film
6320748 all most in this couple of years kuuselan is the first movie which had no objectionable scenes to be certified as u and this shows the sincerity of the team in reaching all class and age group of the public
6320749 all most in this couple of years kuselan is the first movie which had no objectionable scenes to be certified as u and this shows the sincerity of the team in reaching all class and age group of the public
6320750 america pona superstar japan pona superstar africa pona superstar germany pona supersta
6320751 in fact rajini sir will never like this kind of embarrassing situation now the song gets more finishing than what i imagined earlier
6320752 theres already a lot of hype about the movie im very nervous with everyone expecting it to run to a silver jubilee
6320753 today rajnikanths market is such that even if he comes for one scene or two in a film he will still be the superstar
6320754 rajnikanths films attract huge crowds and are a big box office draw however we are confident of sorting out the issue in the next couple of days
6320755 if my films do not release there it is not a problem for me
6320756 i dont know whether i can make it to tokyo itll be great if i can otherwise im excited that the japanese are waiting for kuselan with as much passion as they had for my films a decade ago they are high on emotional content and comic action its a treat to be watched by them
6320757 when its about a rajini or kamal film there are so many rumours making the rounds that it becomes a comedy even thinking about it makes me laugh i am the director of kuchelan and there is no possibility for kamal to act in the film believe me
6320758 i asked kb sir whether a small budget movie will suit me as i am doing only bigger one
6320759 nayantara is there as lead to four of the five songs in the film yen anbae chellamay chellamay and paal papaali
6320760 how can you judge a film in just 3 days the family audiences are yet to watch the film and the opening was good
6320761 satyam has been cropped by 22 minutes so make it crisper everybody felt it was too lengthy in the first half and so we decided to shorten it
6320762 im very happy and contended the way the film has shaped out the censors have been nice and they also acknowledged the fact that the film has a powerful message to convey
6320763 if one wants applause from the audience who pays to see me on screen all these risks are like halwa
6320764 you would never have seen such a car chase in indian films
6320765 when i fall in love ill tell you you guys will be the first to know
6320766 we didnt do it deliberately the story required such a song and that is why it has been included in the film when you watch the movie youll know
6320767 it was because of her co operation that the chemistry shows
6320768 the effort that ive put in this film will be equal to the sum total effort i put in for all my other six films
6320769 a lot of effort went into making the car chase and the chellame chellame song
6320770 when we started this project i submitted rs 3 80 crore as budget for this film however around 24 crores have been spent on this project so far and at no point in time have we spent anything more than what was necessary
6320771 the hero and the heroine prepared themselves for five months for this song which is certain to appeal to kids harris has done a wonderful job and this happens to be his 25th film
6320772 as satyam is a bilingual where the hero plays the role of a cop a lot of effort went into changing costumes thats because the uniform of the tamil nadu cops is different from that of their counterparts in ap so vishal had to change costumes even for the same scene
6320773 the effort that ive put in this film will be equal to the sum total effort i put in for all my other six films
6320774 the song has actually exceeded the expectations and is sure to bust the charts when released
6320775 harris has taken special care over the back ground score which is in sync with the theme of the film the songs are going to be a major highlight of the film and the audio is likely to be released on july 17 or 18 in chennai
6320776 her role will have all elements in equal proportion but there wont be any forced skin show
6320777 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6320778 jessica is americas sweetheart and an internationally known entertainer who takes care of herself you can see it in her smile her skin her confidence and her obvious physical fitness
6320779 im going to make it clear im not going to bring back ozzie because hes ozzie guillen
6320780 im going to bring back ozzie guillen because we need him im going to play the guys out there that do their jobs and i think craig grebeck did a tremendous job its all about winning
6320781 hes my third baseman i love joe crede but if hes struggling i will not put him out there just because his name is joe crede and i dont give a bleep whether he likes it or not
6320782 this is not an appendix it is a baby its a baby
6320783 and then impossibly in an already hushed gallery in one of those moments when the floor of the senate looks like a stage set with its small wooden desks somehow too small for the matters at hand the cry of a baby pierced the room echoing across the chamber from an outside hallway no one mentioned the cry but for a few seconds no one spoke at all
6320784 certainty in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes
6320785 poor judgment was used by bringing an airsoft gun one that can be purchased at wal mart on campus that can shoot plastic bbs
6320786 were not going to have any comment until that process is complete
6320787 after giving up a four spot with peavy on the mound you look down and start seeing what bullpen guys can get you through the game
6320788 i knew he didnt want to load the bases and i kinda guessed right
6320789 you dont really expect to score a lot of runs against one of the games best pitchers
6320790 i obviously didnt have good stuff today but i battled and tried to give the guys a chance to come back
6320791 giving up four in the first to him peavy obviously i didnt like my chances
6320792 hes usually in and around the plate especially when he has the lead that wasnt typical jake
6320793 i just didnt have it i couldnt throw the ball where i wanted to throw it i just didnt make pitches thats all there is to it
6320794 units of the follow up forces which were earlier brought into the conflict zone are being pulled back now
6320795 down there is where you develop up here its a pennant race if you ask if the decision was right id say it was
6320796 tough situation were in a pennant race and were in boston and a lot of focus is on him and he feels the responsibility
6320797 i think coming into this game we were all excited about watching him pitch but the way it unraveled makes it kind of obvious we had to do something
6320798 instead of going out there and gritting my teeth and say im going to get this guy out i go out there and think whats going to happen next
6320799 against boston youve got to be able to hit with men on base
6320800 youve got to score when you get opportunities to score because you never know if youre going to have enough runs
6320801 i think it definitely shows hes strong and capable of throwing about 120 pitches
6320802 actually i didnt think my fastball and location were that great at all
6320803 i think hes definitely capable of pitching like he did tonight
6320804 i got my adrenaline flowing around the eighth inning and the defense played great behind me
6320805 the toughest thing for me is to keep the ball down more consistently
6320806 its not a maybe thing youve got to do it ive got to work on that because its killing me
6320807 all the naysayers who are saying that i lost a step theyll get a full dosage of me next year
6320808 i was trying to throw a cutter down and away
6320809 i told myself as i was walking to the plate that if its out over the plate im going to swing at it and thats what it was
6320810 sometimes i have to do that because ill get too picky up there and not swing and not be myself
6320811 thats not a routine play because he did a good job to get in front of it and knock it down that would have been a terrific play if he could have made it
6320812 hes got to dive and knock a ball down and get an out all at the same time
6320813 that was definitely a break to move that inning along
6320814 anytime you can go out there and throw a complete game its awesome
6320815 the fans got into it and started cheering and a standing ovation anytime that happens its great
6320816 thats huge anytime you can get that kind of run support early in the game it kind of takes pressure off you
6320817 you dont have to be as perfect you have a little cushion and it allows you to relax
6320818 its great that were in a little bit of a groove now but we cant get ahead of ourselves
6320819 he always had good stuff he throws a heavy ball
6320820 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6320821 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6320822 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6320823 i hope so before he got hurt he was pitching lights out
6320824 love to have him back tommy wants to end his career on his own terms
6320825 nobody wants to be forced to the sideline because of injury and he hasnt been able to produce this year because his arm hasnt been sound
6320826 i think theyll probably give him a look give him an opportunity this teams hurting for arms
6320827 i think most guys as they reach the end of their career are looking for that one last standout moment before they ride off into the sunset
6320828 hopefully if he can get this fixed and get back shoot itd be great
6320829 they know what it takes theyve been there and they understand what we have to do
6320830 those are two of the leaders in here and your leaders have to step up and thats what theyre doing
6320831 weve been around for a lot of things good times bad times
6320832 we understand theres a sense of urgency but i think everyone understands that
6320833 its our job to go out and try to prove people wrong
6320834 when people think youre out you almost want to prove them wrong more
6320835 when we need him to come up clutch he always does it
6320836 hes a great leader on this team and he leads by example
6320837 i was hitting my spots and where sometimes im missing three or four inches inside i was able to get that ball in there for strikes tonight and get some outs
6320838 he used all of his pitches his curveball and changeup were great tonight he had great location with his fastball and he kept them off balance he got a lot of ground balls and gave us what we needed
6320839 he had some trouble with his control and with a team like the yankees you cant do that
6320840 some days you can be real good some days you can be ok some days you can be terrible and yesterday i was terrible
6320841 when i got to bat i was kind of nervous i didnt get a hit because i got beaned the first time
6320842 i just tried to get a base hit and it just came
6320843 they dont have to be on a schedule where they have to be here and there they just want to be kids
6320844 i think michael jordan is the best athlete in the world not only for how he played the game but for all he did to grow the sport of basketball
6320845 what he achieved no other human has or in my opinion will its hard enough surviving cancer but winning seven tour de france titles after that is amazing
6320846 has the ability to drown out all distraction and focus in on the moment i feel like i am in a similar situation in swimming since swimming is an individual sport how you perform can impact only you
6320847 jackie joyner kersee is the perfect athlete because she dedicates every day of her life to perfecting herself
6320848 its not so she can be the greatest athlete for her own selfish reasons but so she can deliver hope to a younger generation
6320849 one day i showed up to work and my boss was being handcuffed and put in a car they kind of locked down the place
6320850 i figured that was the end of my life insurance career
6320851 ive got good news and bad news the good news is you scored higher on the test than everybody the bad news is my dad wants to meet you and bring your playbook
6320852 i always enjoyed learning why we did the things we did offensively i always asked why sometimes the coaches maybe misunderstood me i wasnt really questioning them as much as i was just wanting to learn
6320853 i had told my wife awhile back that if mark gets a head job id like to go because i think great things could happen
6320854 if thats the only thing you can find thats wrong with him thats not bad
6320855 some people have to yell and scream to get their point across
6320856 hiv aids is not only a human tragedy of enormous magnitude it is also a threat to the stability of entire countries and to entire regions of the world
6320857 china can grow even more successful by allowing the chinese people the freedom to assemble to speak freely and to worship
6320858 but somebody has to be the first to make change
6320859 what i tried was so unheard of they did not know how to deal with me
6320860 yao shows me respect he should he realizes what i did won the big money for him
6320861 that was the first game my girlfriend came to see me play i scored 40 points and had 30 rebounds on him
6320862 too bad i had already paid for the check i shouldve asked for a discount getting free meals for being a sports celebrity would be very americanized of me dont you think
6320863 i built a bridge it does not matter who did but maybe this did more than something for china maybe it did something for basketball my regret would be if i had not tried
6320864 we feel hes one of the most well rounded running backs weve had here
6320865 granola with fruit and yogurt would be a better choice than flake cereal with milk
6320866 to declare that the danish team was not entitled to take part in the gold medal race to disqualify the danish team and to reallocate the olympic medals to the spanish team gold medal to the german team silver medal and to the italian team bronze medal
6320867 i know its only august whatever but it seems like every day does matter now and oh yeah im nervous i havent been nervous in a long time i keep waiting for the nerves to go away but they havent
6320868 its awesome he creates so much its pretty cool to have something like that
6320869 i was hoping at 3 2 jake wouldnt throw me the slider right there
6320870 when i talked to adam i told him dont try to be something youre not
6320871 it just seems like it takes a lot of pressure off a lot of the guys
6320872 nailing down the four hole for us allows guys not to press so much
6320873 for so long we played poorly and nobody really gained on us
6320874 ive been waiting for since ive been in the big leagues
6320875 were obviously not happy with the season but we can get productive results if you look at certain microcosms of the team
6320876 coming out on top with a winning record in august will prove that weve got a good team here for the future
6320877 it wasnt there for him whether nerves played a part i dont know
6320878 he was lying face down in the water its a sad end
6320879 i just played my game and got into my rhythm ill just take one fight at a time
6320880 you have one or more holds against your account until these holds are cleared you cannot view your grades or schedule or submit a housing deposit
6320881 im trying to obviously take the confidence from last week into this week and trying not to let the expectations get too high
6320882 i feel pretty good about my game and im hoping to have another good finish this week
6320883 its a time of big celebrations for all of us
6320884 im so happy that despite the war lack of sports facilities and training nikpai managed to secure a medal
6320885 it is indeed a big honour and a matter of great happiness for all of afghanistan for this is the first time an afghan athlete has managed to win a medal
6320886 when youre laying in the hospital bed and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to think about next week or next month youre only thinking about the next hour
6320887 its almost the same strategy ive used here to stay in the pack to be patient and stay easy just waiting for your chance
6320888 if there is anyone in the field that can beat me that guy is an absolute legend
6320889 hes a great guy hes obviously been to the depths in his personal life and to come back is a great story lance armstrong epic
6320890 i am genuinely concerned i think australians are beginning to feel genuinely concerned that less than 12 months after the last election they are going backwards in net terms
6320891 well i obviously am representing my constituents and they are concerned
6320892 has trawled through the search results on google google china and the chinese search engine baidu unearthing numerous examples of cached official excel spreadsheets showing he kexin listed as being born on january 1 1994
6320893 my real age is 16 i dont care about what other people say its none of their business
6320894 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegation of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely i believe that these primary documents issued by the chinese state directly available from china by clicking on the links above rise to a level of evidence higher than allegations
6320895 how official are these documents pretty dang official they were issued by the general administration of sport of china
6320896 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
6320897 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me matthew 16 24

6320900 and the things of the earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace
6320901 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
6320902 the report makes it clear that truck drivers were gambling with their lives whenever they used the two wells level crossing said ata chairman trevor martyn
6320903 under the australian standard truck drivers should have been able to look north for 600 metres up the railway line to see oncoming trains
6320904 but the vegetation growing next to the track meant that truck drivers could only see for 60m
6320905 in other words they could not see an oncoming train until it was too late to do anything about it
6320906 every day truck drivers gamble with death or serious injury when they go over level crossings with badly placed stop signs and inadequate sighting distances he said
6320907 his length for his position extreme speed proficient ballhandling and superb body control in the lane allow him to make plays most players cant even think about making you also have to love his upside he improved over the summer as a shooter and defender and he also proved that he is a winner and not just a talent
6320908 looking at the impact that great point guards such as steve nash chris paul and derrick rose are having on the game at the pro and college level it only makes sense for wall to be the no 1 prospect
6320909 perhaps the best basketball i saw all summer was boynton and bradley going at each other in vegas
6320910 both have such competitive spirits and are just killer scorers the higher the stakes the more these guys want the ball in their hands they are also two of the best defenders in the class
6320911 regardless of where he goes to school id be surprised if he didnt average at least 15 points per game i wouldnt be surprised if he averaged more than 20 points per game he also has the ability to be a lockdown defender
6320912 bradleys defense certainly weighs in heavily in his ranking in its simplest form the game breaks down to scoring and not letting your opposition score bradley has a pretty good handle on dominating his man on both sides of the ball
6320913 snaer simply did it all in vegas and with a competitive attitude that bordered on nasty
6320914 we just hadnt seen that from him we knew he could score but we werent aware of his competitive instinct and his all around game now we know his capabilities
6320915 yarou impressed us out of the gates when we watched him in april
6320916 then when we saw him outplay demarcus cousins on memorial day weekend we knew he was definitely a five star candidate his aggressive post play impressive physique and the athleticism that we saw at the end of the summer in vegas convinced us that he is a five star prospect
6320917 he has exceptional balance explosive athleticism strong hands and a motor that doesnt stop on his rebounding alone he will make a living playing the game but he also has impressive upside as an offensive player

6320935 we do not step away from the fact that the incident on qf30 in manila was very serious
6320936 we have cancelled some flights certainly substituted aircraft and we have delayed some passengers just as every airline does

6320943 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6320944 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6320945 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6320946 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6320947 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6320948 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me

6320989 ours were not the kind of parents who would spend time with children
6320990 in the power of money maybe because my parents were artists i remember that every time my father had to choose between increasing his business and going to the museum he would go to the museum and i think that was transmitted to us
6320991 what i wanted was to be free independent of my parents
6320992 modeling is a fast acting job right away you get to work and you learn in two or three months by working
6320993 i dont tell him this because i have to keep him at the level he needs to be at
6320994 but when i reflect as a coach on all the variables in winning and losing for steven to win four world championships and two olympic gold medals is an incredible feat
6320995 hes the kind of guy who if he played basketball he would be lebron james kobe bryant if he were a boxer hed be ali he has the same mentality you see in all the top athletes
6320996 in my mind i always feel im the underdog which is what keeps me from being complacent or stagnant
6320997 but i chose this path i chose to be an athlete my mom told us we had to stand apart and be anything but mediocre and im living up to her expectations
6320998 one says im going to give this guy as much as i can the other says shoot im fighting the best so they dont give me their best
6320999 if his opponent does something defensively its because im making them do something defensively
6321000 i stick to my game that way everybody has to change their game to fight me and when they do that theyre always one step behind

6321002 this issue may end up being very damaging to phelps omega and the usa sadly it could have been avoided with careful thought and basic ethical advice
6321003 its our job to provide the results fina decides what can be published or not fina said it was a no go

6321006 everything is good what are you going to do with the footage see what the serbians already saw it is clarified for us beyond any doubt
6321007 the result of the race as declared by the federation is final and the ioc has no reason to question it
6321008 that sort of stuff is an issue that fina deals with
6321009 we dont get involved with what happens in the pool like that
6321010 i dont see how the company decides the outcome of a race
6321011 too many people are being cheated in this government stunt pupils employers the public and all to make the government look like its doing better than it is
6321012 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6321013 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad alcohol dependence in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6321014 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6321015 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6321016 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6321017 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
6321018 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain the body
6321019 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6321020 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6321021 this was a short term study without placebo so it shows that a longer term trial should be done
6321022 we are planning a larger long term study that will be international in the united states and canada and also in europe
6321023 we selected the best ones did chemistry to modify them and came up with ptc124
6321024 a big bailout for shareholders and managers at the expense of american taxpayers
6321025 if a dime of taxpayer money ends up being directly invested the management and the board should immediately be replaced multimillion dollar salaries should be cut and bonuses and other compensation should be eliminated they should cease all lobbying activities and drop all payments to outside lobbyists and taxpayers should be first in line for any repayments
6321026 the dollar was dented by profit taking following its recent surge
6321027 for this generation of teenagers were not going to have data for the next 15 or 20 years on how effective it a cervical cancer vaccine is what it changes about the dynamics of cervical cancer how long the vaccine lasts whether you can then extrapolate this to decreasing screening guidelines
6321028 we need more long term data from this generation of girls getting vaccinates now to make decisions on a population basis
6321029 our main findings were that preadolescent vaccinating targeting 12 year old girls is fairly attractive
6321030 we found consistently that catch up vaccination up to the age of 18 was cost effective that extending catch up vaccinations in women to the age of 21 was cost effective when we made very generous assumptions about vaccines properties and that generally speaking the catch up up to age 26 was not cost effective
6321031 theres a lot of uncertainty in the data and we had to make a lot of assumptions about the vaccines properties
6321032 we made very optimistic assumptions and we havent looked at the vaccine long enough to know how these assumptions will bear out
6321033 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6321034 if you have had preeclampsia you should be aware that you are at increased risk for renal and cardiovascular disease and you should try to reduce that risk
6321035 historically the thought was that after delivery everything was fine but preeclampsia isnt benign and it may initiate a cascade of damage that takes years to develop into clinically relevant renal disease
6321036 the take home message from this study is that any young woman who has had any variant of preeclampsia and eclampsia needs to be monitored for ongoing or recurrent kidney disease high blood pressure and diabetes
6321037 indeed the likelihood that chronic renal failure did not develop even among women with three previous episodes of preeclampsia was greater than 99 percent
6321038 its critical that doctors and patients understand that there is now a linkage between preeclampsia and esrd for women whove had preeclampsia this is a reason to increase your sensitivity to healthy living and not add to your risk keep your weight down avoid smoking and avoid drinking too much also check for diabetes and blood pressure at least once a year
6321039 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain the body
6321040 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6321041 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6321042 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6321043 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
6321044 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6321045 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6321046 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6321047 but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
6321048 in terms of this replacing the standard method we have of diagnosing skin cancer which is basically to look at a specimen under the microscope its hard to imagine this would do it completely
6321049 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed
6321050 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6321051 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6321052 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6321053 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6321054 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6321055 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6321056 we need to do a much better job of keeping track of these relationships
6321057 in major trials of statins some do not even report on the number of cancers we need a lot more research in this area in terms of biology virtually nothing is known
6321058 what we need is patient level data to see whether a pattern emerges of different risks at different ldl levels
6321059 but when we give medications to millions we need information about risks versus benefits
6321060 there are some question marks and they may change the risk benefit ratio for some patients
6321061 het raadselachtige van vrouwen is dat ze van mannen houden
6321062 what would you do if you discovered somebody being violently treated by their husband
6321063 it is fair to say this may have been the largest job action for teachers ever in california
6321064 it was definitely the right thing to do given the statewide response to the budget cuts
6321065 this was really a statement from parents and the community that we will protect public education
6321066 there could be cuts to aid to the blind and disabled food programs for low income kids and health clinics
6321067 were offering a broader strategy fighting not just for public education but for all social services
6321068 we are the only state in the country the only governmental entity in the world that does not tax oil companies for taking oil out of the ground
6321069 we are still waiting for senator obama to join us please continue to hold
6321070 the conference call is not concluded senator obamas line has been lost and we are trying to re establish

6321074 my ima misses people not places has she seen the towns with names in arabic the hebrew replaces the policies are evil and racist deceitful and heinous youll never be a peaceful state with legal displacement
6321075 we have been forced to take action because of the failure of the unc to live up to its supposed commitment to workers rights
6321076 we are talking about sweatshops but also housekeepers grad students and adjuncts
6321077 we want to build this with campus workers who get up at 2 am to clean our classrooms
6321078 the dsp wont be completely effective until a majority of the collegiate apparel market is signed on its going to be the uncs and other universities with successful division i athletics with large support bases that are going to tip the scales
6321079 we knew people working in the hotel cleaning rooms and asked them to leaflet each room about the sit in
6321080 with the wrc monitoring its more like saying to companies it would be nice if you complied
6321081 the probability of a licensee or factory mounting a successful legal challenge to the program remains low
6321082 this wasnt just about the sit in well come back to meetings next year with more support
6321083 il a trouv que c tait une bonne id e et donc d s la semaine prochaine je vais demander aux autorit s chinoises un visa pour me rendre au tibet je crois que les choses pourront ainsi bouger
6321084 un homme qui souffre avec son peuple qui subit actuellement une r pression f roce
6321085 la chine retrouverait une respectabilit internationale si elle tenait sa parole de renouer le contact et le dialogue avec le dala lama
6321086 les solutions pacifiques les solutions raisonnables que proposent le dala lama doivent tre entendues des autorit s chinoises
6321087 la cause du tibet est une cause pour la v rit et la justice je consid re que ceux qui soutiennent notre cause napportent pas un soutien pro tib tain mais pour la justice
6321088 je suis venue vous dire ma tristesse pour tout ce qui se passe au tibet pour votre peuple
6321089 si tr s modestement ma pr sence peut tre utile faire progresser la cause du tibet faire reculer les souffrances la terreur les violences eh bien je suis contente et tr s honor e quune personnalit comme vous qui pr ne la paix et la non violence puisse maccorder quelques instants
6321090 la cause du tibet est une cause pour la v rit et la justice
6321091 cest indirectement un encouragement ceux qui pr nent la violence
6321092 rencontr un homme dune dimension thique et spirituelle consid rable et en m me temps un homme qui souffre
6321093 tous les hommes et les femmes de bonne volont doivent aujourdhui bouger pour quune solution pacifique soit trouv e ce drame terrible qui frappe aujourdhui le tibet
6321094 le tibet ne concerne pas seulement les tib tains mais lhumanit tout enti re chaque fois quun homme souffre que les libert s reculent nous somme tous concern s
6321095 sur la grande muraille elle salue la chine et sa justice a nantes hier elle la condamne maintenant elle part pour le tibet quel camp son opportunisme choisira t il
6321096 l loge de la justice chinoise par royal fait des vagues
6321097 after being forcibly exiled from their land the people kept faith with it throughout their dispersion and never ceased to pray and hope for their return to it and for the restoration in it of their political freedom
6321098 the apparent triumph of zionism stilled doubts and drowned out the protests of those who argued that what purported to be the solution to one problem had created an entirely different one
6321099 no people in history has ever gone away just because another people wanted them to and the sentiments of crazy horse and sitting bull live on among palestinians to this day
6321100 anti racist blog reserves the right to reject or remove any comments that are racist offensive untrue annoying or disrespectful
6321101 anti racist blog stands by the argument that anti zionism is racism
6321102 the absence of a real link to the suburbs stuck out especially for someone without a drivers license
6321103 if gramma wants to take the kids to cranbrooks science center the smart bus wont stop here
6321104 a few lines still exist from the old system up woodward michigan and jefferson we could bring trains back there
6321105 of 28 similar projects nationwide only one did not continue to expand after its initial construction
6321106 this will make money and create jobs we just need to sell the idea of this investment in transportation even when it seems like the wrong time to spend any money at all
6321107 one option is a local option sales tax that would funnel money into transit but our constitution would have to change to allow it
6321108 it would serve a purpose if its expanded and gets people downtown from say pontiac
6321109 if it remains as proposed it sounds more like entertainment than efficiency
6321110 no transit system is built all at once most new rapid transit systems start with an initial line of 3 to 10 miles
6321111 they were pro bus because they could get people to see its no fun to ride one
6321112 they didnt put enough behind the bus system and it re affirmed that you need a car in this city
6321113 theyre a little busy trying to survive to actively work on transit but they are supportive politically at least
6321114 i remember going to these gm open houses with my father and seeing the concept cars
6321115 and inevitably there would be a mass transit display some engineers in there might dust off those old concepts
6321116 why dont they connect the two then ford could construct something from the airport and chrysler could go from auburn hills south it could be friendly competition
6321117 you can expect to see some darta like proposal in the next year or two
6321118 we are working hard on a bi partisan plan for a transit authority that can ask people for tax dollars and coordinate services nothing else is set up to handle this right now
6321119 devait expliquer aux fran ais pourquoi il na pas tenu parole
6321120 nicolas sarkozy na pas tenu parole il a menti dune certaine fa on puisquil avait dit quil ne se rendrait la c r monie douverture des jo que si les autorit s de p kin reprenaient le dialogue avec le dala lama et avec les tib tains
6321121 or ce dialogue na pas repris la r pression continue malgr tout il sest rendu p kin donc il doit sexpliquer et expliquer aux fran ais pourquoi il na pas tenu parole
6321122 on aurait pu attendre finalement de cette concession quen contrepartie il re oive le dala lama
6321123 moi ce que je souhaite cest quen contrepartie de sa pr sence p kin il ait le courage de rencontrer le dala lama
6321124 dautres pays ont montr que cest en restant debout que lon d fend aussi le mieux les int r t commerciaux pas en se couchant

6321126 be aware that by justifying the occupation of palestinian land you shirk the precedents of international law set forth by the united nations after wwii to stop reckless nations like nazi germany and imperial japan from conquering their neighbors
6321127 the game has changed and the way the game is played has to be changed
6321128 we feel like every person needs to have a relationship with christ
6321129 i didnt feel cornered or judged or pressured in any way
6321130 there have been a lot of bad things done in jesus name
6321131 church positions have been used for power or oppression i am ashamed at times and deeply saddened that things have occurred
6321132 i am not ashamed of the core of what christ is about that in its most pure form is the most beautiful thing
6321133 jesus doesnt really address the issue of war very directly
6321134 god declares righteous all who put their faith in christ alone for their salvation
6321135 at physical death the unbeliever enters immediately into eternal conscious separation from the lord and awaits everlasting suffering judgment and condemnation
6321136 it would be just as sinful for me to commit adultery against my wife as for someone to be in a homosexual relationship
6321137 in terms of scripture and what i believe there is one way and im fully aware that that is offensive and hard to deal with but it becomes an issue of standing on truth
6321138 everybody will be judged for their sin but the only way i escape judgment is because of jesus christ because i have placed my life in his hands
6321139 it would be great if it were possible to come to power through the american electoral system but for a variety of reasons its likely to be impossible
6321140 its very difficult for socialists to get on the ballots
6321141 and the reason for these restrictive laws is because of past socialist and communist victories
6321142 as long as you have a ruling class controlling most of societys institutions that class will use its clout to control the state
6321143 the republicans jump in and say ok look democrats are not talking about your economic issues were not either but at least were telling you about the ten commandments were telling you about abortion were telling you about gay rights the biggest mistake democrats make is to take economics off the table
6321144 the richest one percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent the richest 13 000 families earn more income than the bottom 20 million families we are moving toward an oligarchic form of society
6321145 the master class has always declared the wars the subject class has always fought the battles the master class has had all to gain and nothing to lose while the subject class has had nothing to gain and all to lose especially their lives

6321233 who would have thought three years after the storm the preshdent could come and say new orleans la

6321250 they are doing a great job a great job i would say even though there are ups and downs the achievements are great
6321251 they did not have defenses in that area so they could not prepare themselves to face the military threat

6321260 there is a great need for businesses to be warned in terms of taking precautionary measures in protecting their businesses from similar incidents businesses in central being destroyed by fire seems to be very common and people need to insure their businesses
6321261 theres a concern that the walls may not be able to stand for much longer and may collapse their will be people keeping an eye on things until the morning

6321263 cemex believes the confiscation and subsequent start of the expropriation process is a flagrant violation of the constitution law of expropriation and other laws of venezuela
6321264 cemex also believes the venezuelan governments actions highlight a lack of respect for the principles of international law and the treaties relating to reciprocal protection of investments which forbid the occupation of goods and deprivation of rights without fair and effective compensation and without an expropriation procedure

6321279 its humans that are the problem in my view not the animals when this complex was built rubble was thrown down the ridge and it has created the perfect habitat lots of nooks and crannies on a sunny north facing slope

6321284 abu dhabi is an obvious choice for a boat show as it is the richest of the oil laden united arab emirates has a large expatriate population and is aiming to transform itself into a global tourist destination
6321285 diverse sports amp leisure pursuits are part of the active lifestyle residents enjoy in abu dhabi and the most recently announced 2009 formula 1 tm abu dhabi prix ferrari theme park and warner brothers theme park are all situated on the yas island a 2 500 hectare island development
6321286 we have received overwhelming support from abu dhabi as the host and from the marine industry in particular with regard to the timing of the show
6321287 with the emirates boat show international in abu dhabi we will be well on the way to providing the luxury marine industry in the middle east with a year round calendar of events that marine enthusiasts could look forward to
6321288 for us at knotika boat shows are not just about boats but also everything that goes with the marine lifestyle
6321289 people do not buy a boat just to own it they want to enjoy it to live the culture and that is what we are bringing to abu dhabi this is not simply a boat show it is a marine lifestyle exhibition where they will be able to see and buy the latest coolest and must have yachts and marine products

6321293 mbda chief executive officer pierre voges states that he is not permitted to secure ensure safety or clean the building without heritage approval in saying this he is wrong he is an employee of the city which is itself in charge of looking after the building the law says the city has to maintain the building and for that it needs no permits from phra or anybody else
6321294 the first written request we received for assessment guidelines was june 24
6321295 ultimately we would like to see the nmbm being enabled by the phra to take over our responsibility in managing heritage within our developmental programmes within our areas of jurisdiction
6321296 we believe many aspects of the protection of heritage resources such as policy establishment bylaws establishment of guidelines and criteria enforcement development of spatial plans and building regulations fall outside the responsibilities of a permit committee
6321297 there was definitely no meeting at the end of july
6321298 we have a situation here in port elizabeth where the local authority is trying to force the phra to deem them competent to take over heritage management in the city
6321299 so far not a single municipality in the country has been deemed competent to take over the management of the buildings by phra
6321300 i looked at my other daughter first and realised that this was what roneldi would have wanted we immediately agreed we knew it was the right thing to do
6321301 ren e offered me moral support after the death of my son to loose a child is very traumatic because nothing prepares you for that experience
6321302 organ donation is not a normal topic and people often feel uncomfortable discussing it for cultural or religious reasons we need to educate each other about the importance of organ donation
6321303 its also important for people to make living wills before they die
6321304 we have been very successful and have arrested a number of people and seized a number of bags of perlemoen since the operation started
6321305 the team started with seven members in february and in july we recruited another eight
6321306 the team members do not work set hours as they work on a needs basis
6321307 when they see anything suspicious or what looks like possible perlemoen poachers they will inform our offices and we will mobilise the needed units
6321308 if the poachers use boats then we ask for assistance from the defence force and police and use helicopters to go out and catch them
6321309 since february we have confiscated between six and eight rubber ducks as well as arrested many suspected perlemoen poachers
6321310 we have assisted the marine and coastal management team on various occasions as within the police we have perlemoen sniffer dogs
6321311 you can arrest people and build more prisons but you need to build a value centred society
6321312 the march is the first step of the process we are relying on all people including religious leaders to reconstruct the way people think
6321313 about r3 million was given to rhodes university by the norwegian government in 2007 for santed pandors talk will be based on the benefits of the programme and the challenges faced since its implementation
6321314 these include the xhosa course taken by pharmacy students to assist them during the community service portion of their course
6321315 rescue workers came from as far as cape town and port elizabeth as well as from george wilderness and plettenberg bay
6321316 these people came on their own initiative to help find ray and it is difficult to find enough words to say thank you
6321317 she was a defenceless woman who was raped in an open field
6321318 out of shame about what happened to her she did not even go for psychiatric help
6321319 our individual opinions both influence and are influenced by our surroundings by following a set of rules the researchers have modeled the opinion formation process in societies where individuals opinions are strongly influenced by others they interact with
6321320 can wash your car find you dates and save you seats on the subway all before brunch
6321321 we have re motivated teachers to be on playtime duty and we have told learners to be vigilant
6321322 we have sent our security guard on a course to upgrade his skills
6321323 we have started a security committee and were going to work with the saps to visit problem areas
6321324 our security has always been jacked up but we need to be more careful when it comes to our kids
6321325 we dont have issues with security as we instill values morals and love in our students
6321326 rasool will primarily concentrate on advising the minister on his work in parliament while mbatha will concentrate on other aspects of the ministers work including liaison with luthuli house
6321327 the anc had effectively booted the man out of office less than a month ago on the grounds that he had failed in his duties
6321328 once again we witness somebody who has failed at governing being rewarded with promotion it makes no sense
6321329 there is simply no difference between the so called new anc and the mbeki era anc
6321330 indeed when it comes to cronyism we can see no difference between them and the erstwhile national party regime
6321331 the additional water supply means that we can extend our efforts in terms of the key performance deliverables that form part of the municipalitys integrated development plan not only will we be able to improve on basic service delivery to all our communities but we can also continue to promote economic development which has a direct impact on economic growth and job creation
6321332 officials will do an inspection to see that we have complied with all the requirements and conditions and we will then know when we can start using the water
6321333 i am not aware of any video maybe the investigating officer will have knowledge at this stage i also do not know why charges were withdrawn against brechlin
6321334 i know he max would be accepted back to school they know what kind of calibre he is
6321335 to the pretorius family all i can say is i am sorry
6321336 reasons from a large number of particular examples to a general rule
6321337 reasoning which uses deductive arguments to move from given statements premises which are assumed to be true to conclusions which must be true if the premises are true
6321338 with knowledge but the english word implies a moral standard of action in the mind as well as a consciousness of our own actions
6321339 the substitution of an agreeable or less offensive expression in place of one that may offend or suggest something unpleasant to the listener
6321340 is the decision to evaluate perceive and view life in a generally negative light
6321341 the choice of a context or a reference or the result of this choice from which to sense categorize measure or codify experience cohesively forming a coherent belief typically for comparing with another
6321342 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6321343 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6321344 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6321345 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6321346 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6321347 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6321348 if you assault a police officer you should as a minimum get a police record
6321349 a spent conviction sends a message that the offending behaviour is minor
6321350 anyone who is convicted of assaulting a police officer will receive a criminal record no matter how minor the assault is
6321351 an unemployment rate of 70 per cent to 80 is of great concern to me so i will put my foot down
6321352 im a bit disappointed i didnt have such a good race some things didnt go right

6321360 we have been informed by the hong kong authorities that mr gadd was denied entry to hong kong and has returned to bangkok mr gadd was in contact with us seeking consular assistance
6321361 i am quite famous and hard of hearing please can you arrange for an escort for me at the other end
6321362 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6321363 no paedophile is a celebrity every paedophile needs to be controlled
6321364 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6321365 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6321366 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6321367 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored
6321368 ramuan tradisional untuk balimau tersebut adalah warisan turun temurun sejak dulunya sejak puluhan tahun lalu bahkan konon sejak ratusan tahun lalu
6321369 karena sebenarnya balimau pada awalnya tradisi itu tidak saja dilakukan pada saat memasuki bulan puasa akan tetapi sebagai jelang menjelang antara dua atau lebih kerabat seperti lazimnya orang yang baru nikah menjelang orangtua mertua persyaratan yang biasanya disertakan pada acara itu berupa limau kasai ramuan balimau karena dulu belum ada semacam sampo seperti sekarang tujuannya agar orang yang didatangi dapat membersihkan diri menyucikan diri namun tempatnya tidak di lakukan ditempat pemandian umum tapi di tempat pemandian masing masing
6321370 balimau merupakan ajang silaturrahmi di mana anak kemenakan biasanya mengoleskan ramuan balimau ke kepala para mamaknya
6321371 hanya oleh sebagian masyarakat balimau disalah artikan sebagai hura hura mandi bersama sama ke tempat tempat pemandian umum seperti sungai dan danau juga laut sehingga inti dari bersuci itu bersih secara spiritual dan agama tidak bertemu lagi
6321372 tradisi balimau yang sudah membudaya dikampung kampung dan dinagari di ranah minang maka tradisi balimau tidak bisa dihapus begitu saja

6321402 my hope was that after today i would feel better about our depth
6321403 i feel like we have a really good team and i think it is the farthest any team has been to this point since ive been the coach
6321404 daarna ben ik overgestapt naar evere kerkhoek sportief waar onder anderen ook eddy merckx bij reed hij is ouder dan ik maar we hebben wel af en toe samen getraind bij de jeugd won ik jaarlijks twaalf vijftien wedstrijden mijn grootste troef was mijn snelheid
6321405 het waren andere tijden die grote mobilhomes waren er nog niet heel wat renners reden toen ook nog zowel op de weg als op de piste ik ben op de weg begonnen maar heb er al snel de piste bijgenomen op de piste deed ik mee aan al de disciplines en had ik het meeste succes bij de liefhebbers ben ik onder andere belgisch kampioen geworden op de kilometer tijdrit en omnium omnium brengt alle pistedisciplines samen puntenkoers achtervolging snelheid enzovoort in 1967 heb ik ook de zesdaagse van de toekomst gewonnen bij de liefhebbers voor de wereldkampioen graham webb die koers werd gereden voordat de beroepsrenners in actie kwamen
6321406 in 1967 werden de eerste en enige pre olympische spelen georganiseerd in mexico alle disciplines waren er vertegenwoordigd en heel wat atleten namen eraan deel met van lancker heb ik toen deelgenomen aan het tandemrijden we hebben goud gewonnen
6321407 het was een speciale ervaring met de jaren hebben de spelen meer media aandacht gekregen en dan ga je beseffen wat je hebt meegemaakt de belgische ploeg bestond toen onder meer uit serge reding roger de vlaeminck en gaston roelants we zijn verschillende wedstrijden van de andere atleten gaan bekijken aan de openingsceremonie hebben we niet deelgenomen want onze wedstrijd vond de dag erna al plaats met het tandemrijden hebben we brons behaald individueel was mijn resultaat niet zo goed
6321408 de italianen hebben ons daar gewoon van de piste gereden waardoor we door het gras moesten rijden klagen hielp niet de italianen kregen de overwinning
6321409 ze hadden me een loon beloofd maar ik heb een heel jaar niets gekregen op mijn fiets en materiaal na ik heb toen onder andere de zesdaagsen van brussel gent en antwerpen gereden na een jaar als beroepsrenner heb ik besloten om ermee te stoppen ik ben toen bij de politie van brussel begonnen ik heb er 37 jaar gewerkt nu ben ik met pensioen
6321410 goede jonge liefhebbers worden meteen opgemerkt door managers en die pushen je om beroepsrenner te worden maar ik was geen merckx of sercu dat zijn de uitzonderingen ik ben misschien te vroeg beroepsrenner geworden een beetje gepusht door een manager had ik voortgedaan dan had ik zeker nog wat kunnen winnen ook op de weg ik kon bijvoorbeeld zeker en vast een rol spelen in de klassiekers jaarlijks won ik toch een vijftiental koersen

6321415 i was writing a speech this morning a winners speech and was almost going to give it to him
6321416 i hit a great drive on 18 and two putted for birdie which was a good way to finish
6321417 i felt like i played well today and was happy that i shot a decent score i feel like if i went out tomorrow i could shoot even lower
6321418 i dont play that much golf so to come here where players like david pastore are playing is intimidating
6321419 this is one of the best scores that i have put up this year
6321420 i play here a lot so there are no surprises for me on the course
6321421 i know what to do here which makes it easier
6321422 when i was at the putting green i noticed that they were a lot faster than they usually are and i got a little scared
6321423 almost every birdie putt i had turned into a par or bogey
6321424 ive been busy playing because i am getting ready for college so there is a lot of pressure on me to play good
6321425 i started out by hitting my drive in the bunker and i was like thats not a good start but then i hit it in the green and two putted so that got me going
6321426 ive been having a good season so far ive got about 10 wins this year
6321427 the first two holes were very average for me then i came back and started parring and sank a few putts
6321428 on the last hole i had a seven footer and sunk it for birdie after a monster drive which was nice

6321461 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
6321462 the report makes it clear that truck drivers were gambling with their lives whenever they used the two wells level crossing said ata chairman trevor martyn
6321463 under the australian standard truck drivers should have been able to look north for 600 metres up the railway line to see oncoming trains
6321464 but the vegetation growing next to the track meant that truck drivers could only see for 60m
6321465 in other words they could not see an oncoming train until it was too late to do anything about it
6321466 every day truck drivers gamble with death or serious injury when they go over level crossings with badly placed stop signs and inadequate sighting distances he said

6321510 il y a des tas de choses que je ne fais pas on peut passer un temps norme dans des cocktails serrer des mains on peut aussi en faire l conomie ce qui pr serve un peu de temps mental et physique pour rester l coute des signaux quon re oit des amis et des proches de participer aux bonheurs et malheurs grands et petits sinon on perd le sens de ce qui fait lint r t de la vie
6321511 jai toujours mon gsm allum quand on accepte une fonction on accepte ce qui va avec quand on est ministre cest imp ratif cest rest on apprend vivre avec cette possible intrusion

6321516 le politique ne sen occupe pas assez et pas bien un seul exemple les maisons de repos nont pas t pens es pour quon y passe 30 ou 40 ans il y a beaucoup de choses explorer sur ce terrain l ce nest pas une question de sentiments mais une question de soci t extr mement politique qui demande une approche sociale fiscale conomique

6321525 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6321526 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6321527 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6321528 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6321529 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6321530 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6321531 ive been working on the need for this program for more than a decade mr forrest said
6321532 im representing my electorate we badly want a program like this weve argued for it for years and subject to the detail im supporting it
6321533 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas he told abc radio
6321534 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome
6321535 look i honestly cant understand just where the direction is coming from at the moment mrs hull said
6321536 i am not sure where the advice is coming on this and im you know i am aware that if there were concerns about health issues and criminal checks and etc that there are significant guidelines and criteria to be put in place to cover all of those aspects
6321537 students staff and parents have worked exceptionally hard and have been rewarded with an amazing set of individual and school results
6321538 these results represent outstanding progress by all of the young people involved and are the result of really hard work from them supported by the dedication of all staff and the encouragement of all parents
6321539 we are all delighted at the achievements of the young people at our schools and wish them every success for their future
6321540 we offer special congratulations to the 16 girls who achieved straight a and a grades with a special mention for marie mchugh emily shercliff and rose tiller who achieved 11 a grades
6321541 even better than last year 65 per cent of all grades were at a and a
6321542 these gcse results are exceptional and exceed previous records by some way i am delighted for our year 11 pupils and their teachers
6321543 there are so many notable individual achievements that it is impossible to record them all but to have two pupils finish in the top 10 nationally for gcse french when they have taken the exam a year early is remarkable
6321544 after a record breaking set of a level results we now have gcse results that do justice to the talents and commitment of our year 11 students my warmest congratulations go to the girls but also to our team of highly skilled and enthusiastic teachers
6321545 i am thrilled with these results the best the school has ever achieved at gcse and i am sure the pupils and their parents will be as delighted as we are
6321546 this is a talented year group which has worked very hard and 38 per cent of the year gained 10 or more a or a grades
6321547 it is super these results have been attained by a mixed ability group of pupils i am very proud of them all
6321548 the results reflect the hard work of the students and the staff guiding them these are the best results for 20 years but we still have a continued school improvement job to do i wont rest until this is an outstanding school in the next ofsted inspection
6321549 these are excellent results the highest pass rate achieved by the school to date and a reflection of the hard work of students and their teachers i would like to congratulate all students on their tremendous individual achievement
6321550 we couldnt be more pleased with our students gcse results in 2007 our a to c results were the best in cambridgeshire for a non selective school these 2008 results are better still
6321551 not only have our pupils exceeded the performance of last years cohort by some six percentage points 30 per cent of all grades achieved were a or a
6321552 particular praise must go to the 15 young people who achieved 11 or more passes at a or a
6321553 we are delighted with our students examination performance which ranks with the best ever achieved at chesterton we are especially pleased with the high percentage of top grades 29 per cent of all grades were a or a
6321554 the students worked really hard and had a very positive attitude which was reflected in the results
6321555 we only have a very small number of students who followed a few repeat gcses it is very pleasing many of our students have improved on their previous results
6321556 we set ourselves ambitious targets five years ago when we became a specialist business college in 2002 the percentage of students achieving five or more higher grades was 33 per cent we have increased that figure by 26 percentage points in six years
6321557 kings is a school where each individual pupil can thrive and achieve beyond their own expectations we are tremendously proud of our students achievements
6321558 for almost a third of the grades to be at a is an outstanding achievement and has blown away all previous records
6321559 many congratulations to all those students who over the last two years have put in so much hard work and effort all their endeavours have really paid off
6321560 again these students have achieved so well we are delighted so many will now further their education in the meridian sixth form college where they can expect to prepare themselves for their chosen careers and exciting university courses
6321561 its a credit to the school and students and one student katie dean even received 11 straight a s despite her suffering from illness throughout
6321562 its wonderful to share the excitement of all our pupils who have scored nothing below an a grade but it is just as satisfying to share the sense of achievement of those for whom a b or c is a real measure of success
6321563 the results announced so far indicate that cambridgeshires gcse students have excelled again

6321619 save his life stop abuses on prisoners and abolish the death penalty starting from the united states of america
6321620 we are convinced the inquiry and trial that led to reginald being sentenced to death reveal an abuse of the law errors of form and procedural flaws
6321621 reginald is african american he was a street kid and a member of a gang he belonged to a world that the us institutions and texas in particular fight with such rigor it often becomes prejudice we suspect
6321622 the verdict contains elements of racial discrimination and this is confirmed by the fact that reginald blanton was not judged according to his constitutional rights by a jury of his peers the district attorney also arranged it so that the entire jury was made up of white americans and it is for this reason that the 5th circuit court of appeals recognized this violation of his assurance of a fair trial
6321623 reginald blanton was sentenced on evidence given by unreliable witnesses extorted under grave threats from his brother robert members of a gang him too and to the latters girlfriend even if they withdraw their charges in front of the court
6321624 the climate of intolerance and prejudice has inexplicably brought to a guilt verdict this in the bargain in spite of the fact that there was no eye witness able to identify the culprit no murder weapon has never been found there were no reginalds fingerprints or traces of his dna into the victims apartment moreover
6321625 there is a damning evidence that can prove the defendant is not guilty the evidence consists of the footprint left by the killer as he kicked open the door to garzas apartment the print of a size 12 shoe whereas reginald blanton wears a size 9 blanton required several times that his shoes worn the day of the crime would be shown to the jury during the trial so that they could notice this detail but his request as many others has never been approved
6321626 we are able to demonstrate an incredible sequence of errors and violations of human rights in reginald blantons case
6321627 and we are convinced the us judicial system which still makes use of the death penalty too often makes legal errors and procedural flaws the law decides whether a human being should live or die with a margin of error that is inevitably high and often linked to social and personal bias as well as to the defendants previous record and race all this in defiance of article 11 of the universal declaration of human rights we ask ourselves how many other innocent people will be put to death by the executioner before the death penalty is abolished and a respect of life is re established
6321628 considering the impossibility by both the police and judicial system to prove the guilt
6321629 because we are convinced that many innocent people have been put to death those in power often want to set a example in an attempt to fight crime but when institutional revenge puts an innocent person to death it makes a martyr of him and in that moment democracy civilization and humanity are transformed into cruelty injustice and brutality

6321690 ninoy brought out the best in me and i also brought out the best in ninoy

6321803 freedom can be denied for a while but it cannot be denied forever
6321804 poland has always been a strong defender of freedom even in dark days when it was not able to fully express its desire for freedom
6321805 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6321806 but it is even more important to have friends who share your hopes and aspirations and dreams and poland and the united states are those kinds of friends
6321807 nobody has the right to tell poland what to do those times have passed
6321808 they feel that poland is one of their territories and poland is entering their field
6321809 its in polands interest to stay on the american radar to be seen from washington and if we are ever in trouble to hope at least for american support
6321810 we had to do it if only to retain our sovereignty if we had rejected the russians would have interpreted it as a success

6321821 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
6321822 i could go on and on about the differences of today and when i was young i come from a time when we used to use a horse and cart
6321823 when i was younger i was into all kinds of sports
6321824 these days because i can no longer do sport i try to keep my mind active instead
6321825 when i go to galleries i see paintings for 300 and i think i could paint that and sell it
6321826 when i was younger i had to travel for hours to go to dances but these days you have motor cars and motor ways and it only takes a few minutes
6321827 it used to take us an hour to get to school every morning on our horse and sulky
6321828 i suppose people today wouldnt know what a sulky is
6321829 its similar to a cart but it has a seat in it
6321830 you used to have to work at it like in business and nursing
6321831 but these days if it doesnt workout you just go pack your bags and leave
6321832 you hear about people being married three or four times but i dont know how they do it
6321833 during the first year i earned seven threepence and board
6321834 i got a rise of 15 shillings a week during my second year and by my third year a guinea and a pound
6321835 i had always wanted to be a doctor but i didnt have the money or way to do it
6321836 police and nurses go together because they are as bad as each other
6321837 some of my favourite memories were of travelling around the world to conventions with geoff

6321840 we are encouraging women from when theyre sexually active until they are 60 to get them every two years
6321841 it takes 10 years for cervical cancer to develop but doing pap smears every two years can help detect the disease before it gets out of control
6321842 63 89 percent of eligible women participate in cervical screening in the south west which compares favourably with the state rate of 60 97 however there is always scope for improvement given that over 35 percent of eligible women are still not having pap smears every two years
6321843 one of the ways we can reduce the incidence and death rate from cervical cancer is to encourage all women who have ever had sex to participate in regular two yearly pap smears
6321844 this includes those who have been immunised with the new human papillomavirus vaccine as the vaccine does not protect against all types of the cancer causing virus

6321851 i can only venture that probably among the reasons was that they cannot comply with the requirements that we set it usually happens during the bidding there are others who may be interested but upon close examination and clarification they back out from the bidding
6321852 we have to deliberate on their findings and recommendations because what happened is that there might be documents that twg have concerns or questions so we sit together with the bac deliberate on it and decide on things before coming out with a decision whether to pass the prospective bidders or not

6321864 thaksin is a criminal who is avoiding an arrest warrant issued by the court why can he still have all kinds of passports
6321865 if we dont expose the government tyranny theyll bring in martial law
6321866 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties
6321867 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6321868 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6321869 it could potentially be an opportunity for these pastors still to come together and just use this as a strategic time of prayer and intercession for the nation this was going to be a multi denominational gathering of pastors and leaders of various churches and we hope that somehow theyll still be able to convene

6321884 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
6321885 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
6321886 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny

6321898 if we then are to have fellowship with jesus christ in his present work we must spend much time in prayer we must give ourselves to earnest constant persistent sleepless overcoming prayer i know of nothing that has so impressed me with a sense of the importance of praying at all seasons being much and constantly in prayer as the thought that that is the principal occupation at present of my risen lord i want to have fellowship with him and to that end i have asked the father that whatever else he may make me to make me at all events an intercessor to make me a man who knows how to pray and who spends much time in prayer

6321910 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6321911 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6321912 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6321913 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6321914 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6321915 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6321916 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6321917 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6321918 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6322285 most six sigma and lean training is based around thinking from 20 years ago based on successes in motorola and ge we wanted to take an up to the minute look at what makes a successful programme today
6322286 as the use of the lean six sigma methodology and tools are growing quickly researching its success factors is important to make sure that lean six sigma is not misused and so continues to have a high positive impact
6322287 lean six sigma practice has enormous potential to improve business performance how the training of professionals in tools and success factors takes place and the implementation of these in practice is currently an under researched area it should be a concern of all leading researchers and training organisations in this area to ensure that it is performed correctly in order to maximise its impact
6322288 i think practitioners are more critical and focus not only on how well the deployment is accepted but also on how well their internal processes are working eg project selection review sessions bb development etc
6322289 sponsors on the other hand are happy to see positive results and focus less on the process side
6322290 when the general electric heuristic for making initiatives work e q x a effectiveness of the programme is a function of its technical quality times its cultural acceptance is considered it can be seen that there is a fairly even split between cultural and technical factors this implies that the people aspects of any improvement programme are as important as the technical tools and techniques used this is why we at sigmapro spend a lot of time in our training on change management
6322291 in my experience they are often reluctant to do this

6322355 this is my faith its what i believe and what i cherish
6322356 what do you have to lose by believing in god youre an agnostic it means that you have faith that theres something larger than you in the universe why wont you put a name to it and find god how could it hurt
6322357 how can you have such faith and love and devotion for something you cant even see
6322358 you know you dont have to be sorry yes im not saved but really what bj said to me got me thinking what do i really have to lose by going to church or even accepting god i mean all it does is make you live a more wholesome life how can i hate that
6322359 how can all of this just have happened look at how beautiful it is how can anyone accept that this is just by accident
6322360 did i really just say that me of all people
6322361 well it kind of is when youre the absolute best at something and the lord is the absolute best you deserve your pride and you have the right to boast
6322362 it is my firm belief that when any new christian is born and they trust themselves unto the lord they can pray to him out loud and with confidence that it is no longer a burden or task but a blessing
6322363 would either get convicted in my heart for my sins and saved while searching for the truth or i would be cast out and never find god in this world

6322366 the american people cannot afford to keep bailing out big businesses lenders investment bankers and brokers who made big mistakes
6322367 fannie mae and freddie mac were set up by congress to subsidize the housing market but theyve lost 11 billion in past months and just announced another 3 1 billion in losses the companies say that they have enough cash reserves but some analysts believe they may have 1 trillion in bad mortgages between them their stock prices have been plunging and they are cutting dividends it wont be long before they put their hands out for the subsidies authorized by congress in the recent housing bail out bill
6322368 both organizations have started to cut back on buying loans they also are becoming more careful in which loans they buy this is what they should have been doing years ago but congress was too busy using them to try to win votes
6322369 before the treasury department provides a dime to either fannie mae or freddie mac it needs to put together a plan for restructuring and fully privatizing both companies
6322370 after that no more federal support under any circumstances they would have to live within their means just as we normally expect individuals and businesses to do
6322371 finally the coming financial crisis with fannie mae and freddie mac should become a wake up call for americans to elect leaders who will put the governments financial house in order
6322372 its time senators mccain and obama take a break from arguing over ads featuring paris hilton and britney spears
6322373 they should stop impugning each others patriotism long enough to address real issues of importance to voters such as the looming housing bailout crisis
6322374 the federal budget deficit is 400 billion this year and will run 500 billion next year the national debt is 9 5 trillion weve promised to pay 100 trillion more in medicare and social security benefits than we have money coming in for those programs
6322375 it wont be easy but for the sake of our children and our grandchildren we must say no to more bail outs no to more wasteful spending no to more special interest subsidies no to more big spending programs and no to more adolescent bickering between candidates who claim to be able to solve americas critical problems

6322386 maar om 19u was hij nog niet terug zijn gsm nam hij niet op dus ben ik in mijn auto gestapt en hem gaan zoeken misschien was hij onderweg een vriend tegengekomen en een pintje gaan drinken dacht ik maar eigenlijk wist ik wel beter patje zou me dan zeker hebben gebeld er moest iets zijn gebeurd

6322404 one of our most popular games is actually an advergame for guitar hero 2 by red octane
6322405 its a simplified version of the real guitar hero game that you play with your computer keyboards this advergame is also the game that is being embedded the most so its a very effective word of mouth communicator for guitar hero 2
6322406 i am not sure if marketing departments are using the full potential of viral spread of advergames yet

6322414 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go
6322415 why did you start blogging about food and what brought you into this great community
6322416 was it something you decided one afternoon while thinking about what you should cook for dinner that day or did you thought long and hard before jumping into it
6322417 people consider me a good writer why not just write about my cooking
6322418 politicians love to turn their stories into great epics and sometimes they have to embellish to smooth out the story line
6322419 but now there are too many professional and amateur fact checkers
6322420 and there are hundreds if not thousands of bloggers who have detailed knowledge on specialized information so you really cant get away with stretching the truth anymore
6322421 i am more bullish than bearish i think the market has too quickly discounted geopolitical risks and was too concerned with demand destruction we should be trending back towards 120 125 a barrel
6322422 we see the big picture of demand destruction in the us but there is also a lot of bullish news that is driving the market
6322423 there is clearly concerns on inflation and the weak opening says that we should be languishing around the same level
6322424 inflation numbers will determine the near term trend of the market the numbers are not expected to excite the market and this could weaken the indices towards close unless of course global cues improve
6322425 this is good as the extent of fund raising through an issue of shares that will result in a dilution of equity is less now
6322426 instead they are putting their investment book to good use by selling stakes instead of just earning dividends from them
6322427 they may have got better valuations a few months back but this will still be a better way to unlock value and raise money
6322428 dont contribute in the name of teachers any good teacher will hate you for it

6322432 as an inhabitant of the third world i have to appreciate wikipedia for making me smarter go ahead and make fun of such statement you rich people of north america that happens to be truly how i feel so yes mock me for turning over to wikipedia when you guys surely have access to libraries and encyclopedias and proper teachers that are fully reliable and whatever donate or donate not do as you wish but cut out all the madness and pretentiousness for the good of us all please
6322433 i do find that the complaints about the validity of contribution and editing a quality control should be heard it needs work there are knowledge systems that address these issues and this is surely an area of work which requires funding get it

6322436 how exactly do you expect people to make a living selling books when you rocket scientists work so hard to give them away
6322437 i looked at one of your programming ebooks and found it seriously lacking
6322438 then after you kill a great source of money for many people you have the nerve to ask for donations do you ever stop and think about what you are doing or do you just robotically trudge along
6322439 imagine a world where quality multilingual education is available for free at the click of a button
6322440 the unvarnished truth is that what we most frequently give thanks for betrays what we most highly value
6322441 the pardoned soul is out of the gunshot of hell
6322442 adoration is not seeking the divine presence but it is conscious of it to an unutterable degree and therefore full of awe and peace

6322445 i would like to be here but i dont know whats going to happen
6322446 this will allow me to take a step back and get a better idea of why my pitches were lukewarm and belt high
6322447 there is something that i would like to express and that is to the public of christchurch who have been of great assistance with the sightings
6322448 it didnt totally surprise me hes come from two world series champions and you know that hes a lightning rod one way or the other
6322449 attention follows him theres a curiosity factor we are waiting to see what the results ultimately are going to be hoping he can do this through october
6322450 historically if you look at it the success rate is probably around a third or one fourth

6322456 however it is clear that they were not motivated by personal gain but rather a misguided desire to make an otherwise unworkable arrangement workable
6322457 the most serious failings do not rest with these individuals but with the defence force as an organisation
6322458 it is now clear that the conditions of service package applicable to these officers almost in its entirety is contrary to the un staff rules for seconded personnel
6322459 however clearly the supplementary allowances were paid in breach of un rules and senior officers filled out un forms indicating they were not in receipt of a housing allowance from new zealand when they were
6322460 notwithstanding that other countries secondees may have done this and that the senior officers might have thought that this was required of them that was not acceptable behaviour
6322461 in particular i have asked him to report to me on the cause of and actions necessary to address the institutional failure revealed by the court
6322462 four officers have been censured but senior officers who condoned the activity take no responsibility
6322463 the nzdf cannot continue to brush this under the carpet
6322464 anyone can go on there and submit a load of crap and have it considered real it is not the best source for research of any kind
6322465 a review by nature last year that compared wikipedia with the encyclopaedia britannica showed that the number of errors in both encyclopedias was almost equal
6322466 it cant possibly be true that professionals will do it for free just out of kindness
6322467 it takes thousands of hours and many men to fine tune
6322468 more people use closed source so it must be better
6322469 a person who has special skill or knowledge in some particular field
6322470 and a 2004 systematic comparison of german wikipedia articles with those in two other encyclopedias also found wikipedia to be accurate and comprehensive
6322471 we did not find more errors in the texts of the free encyclopedia than in those of its commercial competitors
6322472 wir haben in den texten der freien enzyklop die nicht mehr fehler gefunden als in denen der kommerziellen konkurrenz
6322473 if you can find a better online encyclopedia at a lower price buy it
6322474 im the best in the world in this field but people keep removing my entries and accuse me of violation the terms of the site
6322475 a standard bound hard copy published encyclopedia can be cross referenced and then noted as being incorrect retractions and corrections are published on the internet and in bound volumes and changes in information and perspective are readily apparent between editions
6322476 some hamburger campaign that some restaurant had for two weeks
6322477 found wikipedia to be accurate and comprehensive but lacking multimedia
6322478 you cant cite wikipedia as a source because when you go to check the source it may not be the same as when you used it
6322479 if you oppose wikipedia because of inaccuracy why not jump in and try to improve it join us let us fight together
6322480 doubt wikipedia doubt the tv doubt the radio doubt your textbook teachers make mistakes and above all doubt what you believed yesterday whenever you get new evidence
6322481 one of us is not as smart as all of us
6322482 c watt says december 7th 2007 at 6 59 am too many people dont understand that wikipedia is not meant to be authoritative it provides an overview and points to more in depth sources my wife teaches at a university and must constantly remind her students that wikipedia is a fine place to start but not acceptable as a source the most valuable research tools on any wikipedia page are the links and sources at the bottom of the page you should never quote an encyclopedia written or online in any research paper anyway
6322483 wikipedia is a shrine of knowledge full of fact and not biased by opinion

6322489 i set out to write a non troubles book because i didnt want that to be the only thing that ireland and especially the north is known for i realise that it is still there in our past and it would be the elephant in the corner if it didnt feature in our fiction but i think too many people suffered for us as writers to use that history in a lazy or manipulative way for entertainment or titillation or a romanticized version of a past that was never true
6322490 over the past few years ive managed to include the moonstone oranges from spain ian rankins a good hanging the outsiders and the godfather into my classes alongside the great gatsby and hamlet which are two of my favourite texts from my own days at school

6322492 so too at the human level china offers a political and social landscape in which the individual fits in or gets out
6322493 it doesnt matter whether this information is true or not what matters is

6322495 to avoid hitting them pu said many foreigners jaywalk along xiaobei road forcing him to drive extremely slowly he said
6322496 like local residents any foreigner who crosses against a red light or jumps over a road divider will be fined between 20 yuan 2 90 and 50 yuan
6322497 every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
6322498 we are targeting 9 per cent growth getting up to 10 per cent it may look ambitious with the global economic slowdown but in the medium term it is achievable
6322499 construction firms are looking at hiving off these projects into holding units and sell stakes in them to recycle blocked capital
6322500 firms started falling over themselves to win such projects and had cut down the irr by 2007 it had become messy as firms were quoting off the cuff rates
6322501 there is no point in borrowing and investing to get return of 12 per cent when your own cost is 13 per cent
6322502 whatever bot projects we are bidding for will be keeping in mind the interest rates and inflation
6322503 if you paid for your textbooks you shouldnt need wikipedia to do your homework
6322504 it is a haven for pr agents nationalists and the lunatic fringe na vely too many people believe it was written by educated and altruistic perfectionists
6322505 omg but anybody can edit wikipedia its a bad source
6322506 no you cannot cite any encyclopedia they are used to find sources not as a standalone reference
6322507 librarians and professors hate us because we make life easier for students
6322508 itd pay for far more access to the project than you likely use but students in india pakistan thailand and all across asia the world even will benefit from your supporting the wikimedia foundation
6322509 constantly updated constantly revised constantly moderated and constantly read mass information database
6322510 from the fundraising blog omg wikipedia is gone ill flunk my exams
6322511 wikipedia is definately sic an interesting resource and is incredibly useful in inproving sic the overall understanding of a subject
6322512 just out of curiosity why do all the people that claim support of wikipedia have such apalling sic grammer sic
6322513 if i ever have a burning urge to translate something from klingon into elvish then believe me when i say wikipedia is the first place i will look
6322514 but as an actual source for work of degree level or higher i dont think so youre not that good and you really need a large warming mug full of get over yourselves
6322515 i teach english comp at a state university even if wikipedia where to fold the ability to use and navigate other sources is invaluable
6322516 librarians and professors hate us because we on the whole make life easy for students sometimes too easy
6322517 librarians and professors hate us because we on the whole make life easy for students
6322518 just what would you do if instead of the cornucopia of information youre used to you got a message that
6322519 if youre worried about the accuracy of what youre reading do some checking and fix the article instead of whining and dismissing the whole enterprise
6322520 wikipedia has no right to have ever created this page
6322521 im sorry but the people who write rubbish like that really do need to get over themselves
6322522 wikipedia has no right to have ever created this page
6322523 for one science whether natural or humanistic is a continuous process of re evaluation and re thinking which requires a fundamental sceptical approach to everything this approach cannot be formally taught each student must find this out by himself for example by reading the arguments in sources reading other arguments in other sources and then thinking about the two in relationship to one another but reading summaries doesnt encourage reflection
6322524 just what would you do if instead of the cornucopia of information youre used to you got a message that
6322525 librarians and professors hate us because we on the whole make life easy for students sometimes too easy
6322526 a life without wikipedia is a life not worth living
6322527 students in india pakistan thailand and all across asia the world even will benefit from your supporting the wikimedia foundation
6322528 students all over the world will benefit from your supporting the wikimedia foundation
6322529 the organizations websites are helpful for those without textbooks or in areas where textbooks are prohibitively expensive and the people are very poor such as say thailand or india
6322530 wikipedia is very important and i use it for fun not for school
6322531 however i dont really care about people in india or pakistan gettting to use it
6322532 we outsource many of our jobs over there already should we give them more
6322533 i dont feel its my responsibility to pay for their education
6322534 librarians and professors hate us because we on the whole make life easy for students sometimes too easy
6322535 in particular this post seems to imply that the fundraiser is going poorly
6322536 librarians and professors dont hate wikipedia because it makes students lives
6322537 these people should be ashamed for using wikipedia for tests
6322538 i pumped my dissertation full of stuff borrowed from the internet thanks wikipedia
6322539 perhaps i should recommend to you the same remedy dont knock it if you havent tried it
6322540 students in india pakistan thailand and all across asia the world even will benefit
6322541 furthermore if a student writes a paper on a subject why not contribute that text under creative commons license or use it to start a new article if necessary

6322560 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
6322561 the report makes it clear that truck drivers were gambling with their lives whenever they used the two wells level crossing said ata chairman trevor martyn
6322562 under the australian standard truck drivers should have been able to look north for 600 metres up the railway line to see oncoming trains
6322563 but the vegetation growing next to the track meant that truck drivers could only see for 60m
6322564 in other words they could not see an oncoming train until it was too late to do anything about it

6322599 i probably rode her little closer than i wanted to but they went really steady up front
6322600 when she got out she had plenty of clear galloping room she let down pretty good
6322601 she got a little bit lost when she got to the front and rolled to the fence but to her credit she kept finding the line
6322602 we were hoping she would make ground and run a nice race at her first start
6322603 peter might look at giving her a run perhaps melbourne midweek
6322604 the plan would be to let her go for a break and mature brisbane or adelaide races maybe the oaks could be the plan

6322611 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up

6322615 cf death is swallowed up in victory so paul here is talking about the resurrection trotter doesnt believe the resurrection has happened yet and neither do i i think its fairly obvious it hasnt and this could be taken up in another place but here is the passage paul is quoting from in isaiah 25 8 he will a swallow up death for all time and the lord god will b wipe tears away from all faces and he will remove the c reproach of his people from all the earth for the lord has spoken what does this language sound reminiscent of revelation 21 4 4and he will i wipe away every tear from their eyes and j there will no longer be any death k there will no longer be any mourning or crying or pain l the first things have passed away

6322701 weve outperformed the market by a factor of over three times the profit after tax fall is purely a tax timing issue
6322702 weve taken our prices down by nearly 40 per cent on three years ago weve doubled the units sold but we havent changed quality
6322703 we opened five stores last year well open six stores this year and 15 in south africa
6322704 we want to take the slowdown as an opportunity to grow market share
6322705 were going to make other reductions to our prices and we hope to drive greater increases in sales by opening more stores
6322706 well also prepare ourselves for the economic slowdown by making sure our stocks are lean and we manage the business carefully by controlling costs and managing inventories
6322707 were selling everything from dresses to soft tops in womenswear and weve taken a strong view on colour and print
6322708 theres a process in place for the delegates to work on the platform and we are going to let that process work itself out

6322712 i dont think that this is bad news at all actually the fact weve got 350 000 more jobs than we had when we were elected 1999 to lead the government should be very good news for new zealand
6322713 the days of a mortal are as grass he blossoms like a wild flower in the meadow a wind passes over him and he is gone and his place knows him no more

6322715 the goal was simple to create a suite of products based on their ground breaking replay technology that would help software developers get their products done on time with as few bugs as possible
6322716 this kind of harassment is done against the indigenous leader and organization that stood against the destructive economic policy of this regime of president gloria macapagal arroyo and their rampant disregard for human rights
6322717 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties

6322719 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6322720 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6322721 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6322722 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6322723 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6322724 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6322725 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6322726 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6322727 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6322728 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6322729 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6322730 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6322731 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6322732 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6322733 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6322734 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6322735 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6322736 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6322737 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6322738 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6322739 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6322740 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6322741 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6322742 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6322743 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6322744 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6322745 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6322746 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6322747 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6322748 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6322749 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6322750 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6322751 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6322752 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6322753 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6322754 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6322755 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6322756 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6322757 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6322758 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6322759 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6322760 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6322761 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6322762 the good rain across time and terrain in the pacific northwest
6322763 its going to be hard for him to fight against the general tide thats an uphill battle for all republicans nationwide and i think thats whats really bringing him down
6322764 i dont think theres any firing offense for sununu but its a tough year for republicans
6322765 he is a very accomplished ambitious young legislator so its not that hes done a bad job
6322766 its just that his party is having a very tough time and he has a very strong opponent
6322767 in some ways mr sununu has got many things going for him except that he is a republican at a time when theres this shift and no one knows ultimately how strong this shift will be
6322768 but if were playing the guessing game than yeah this race leans democrat
6322769 if mr sununu is the beneficiary of what were seeing in the presidential race a trend for this race to be close and for states to vote along traditional lines he probably has a chance to take himself out of the most endangered category
6322770 theres no question jean shaheen will have the money she needs to be competitive in this race the democrats are going to make sure of that
6322771 i thought you had became a man whore gt gt
6322772 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
6322773 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6322774 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6322775 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6322776 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6322777 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms
6322778 but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
6322779 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6322780 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6322781 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6322782 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6322783 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6322784 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6322785 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6322786 it was the american colonels even more than the generals who were asking for more troops
6322787 we believe in why we are fighting here and we want to finish this fight we know we can win it
6322788 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6322789 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6322790 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6322791 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6322792 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6322793 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6322794 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6322795 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6322796 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6322797 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6322798 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6322799 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6322800 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6322801 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6322802 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6322803 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6322804 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6322805 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6322806 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6322807 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6322808 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6322809 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6322810 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6322811 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6322812 to buy offsets for the carbon footprint theyll leave by traveling and staying in the metro area
6322813 basically carbon offsetting involves helping someone to do something that they wouldnt otherwise have done that results in less co2 emissions than would have happened had you not helped them to do it
6322814 a lot of my friends talk to me about these issues but not a lot of people do something about it
6322815 i think its really important for young people to get involved
6322816 thats the key here you have to have a comprehensive plan that looks at everything so we become less dependent on foreign oil
6322817 we get nothing out of the plan to drill offshore
6322818 seven hundred thirty of his constituents have signed a petition that we need to get away from using oil we gotta do something better than the same old stuff
6322819 cheap clean renewable energy sources like solar and wind within 10 years
6322820 its important to me because the state of economy as well as national security hinge on these very issues
6322821 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6322822 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6322823 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6322824 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6322825 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6322826 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6322827 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6322828 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6322829 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6322830 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6322831 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6322832 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6322833 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6322834 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6322835 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6322836 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6322837 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6322838 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6322839 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6322840 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6322841 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6322842 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6322843 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6322844 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6322845 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6322846 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6322847 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6322848 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6322849 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6322850 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6322851 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6322852 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6322853 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6322854 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do
6322855 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative
6322856 but the alabama constitution which chief justice roy moore is sworn to uphold clearly it says as a matter of fact that the recognition of god is the foundation of that states constitution
6322857 that no religion shall be established by law that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect society denomination or mode of worship that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship nor to pay any tithes taxes or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship or for maintaining any minister or ministry that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state and that the civil rights privileges and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles
6322858 betsy theyre not going to lose it public housing because if you work less than 30 hours a week if you work more than 30 hours a week you dont have to do it if youre between the ages of 18 and 62 and youre not legally disabled and you have free housing in other words
6322859 no wait a second sean let me correct you most people in public housing are not receiving free housing many of them are paying almost market rates
6322860 betsy that is so ridiculous and so false its hardly even worth spending the time
6322861 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6322862 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile
6322863 if he kerry had his way and the cia would almost be nonexistent
6322864 this is veep week that in reality is about all that anyone outside senator barack obamas inner inner circle knows
6322865 unless its al gore or john kerry or santa claus
6322866 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6322867 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6322868 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6322869 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6322870 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6322871 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6322872 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6322873 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6322874 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6322875 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6322876 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6322877 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6322878 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6322879 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6322880 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6322881 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6322882 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6322883 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6322884 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6322885 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6322886 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6322887 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6322888 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6322889 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6322890 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6322891 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6322892 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6322893 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6322894 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6322895 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6322896 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6322897 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6322898 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6322899 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6322900 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6322901 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6322902 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6322903 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6322904 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6322905 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6322906 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6322907 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6322908 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6322909 obama campaign officials never bought the argument that clinton was the second choice of edwards voters immediately after edwards dropped out of the race at the end of january obama won 11 straight contests in a row
6322910 you have to wait for the september issue of crack to come out in three days
6322911 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
6322912 clinton exploded demanding to know why the campaign wasnt on the attack solis doyle was put on a plane to iowa the next day to oversee the closing weeks within hours of the call the panicked staff produced a blistering attack on obama for what it characterized as evidence of his overweening lust for power he had written a kindergarten essay titled i want to become president the campaign was mocked for weeks
6322913 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
6322914 a place in ghana where its difficult to send and receive e mail
6322915 praying for a deluge to drown out barack obama at the democratic national convention in two weeks time
6322916 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
6322917 no one has been found guilty of anything lets not trash the constitution
6322918 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely antiwar ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul
6322919 faced with desertions by his political supporters and the neutrality of the pakistani military president pervez musharraf of pakistan an important ally of the united states is expected to resign in the next few days rather than face impeachment charges pakistani politicians and western diplomats said thursday
6322920 when ms hunter her baby and the youngs moved to california around the end of last year they all initially lived in the same residence according to an associate of mr young and mr edwards
6322921 but the arrangement strained relationships and ms hunter moved into a different residence which cost about 6 000 a month in rent
6322922 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6322923 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6322924 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6322925 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6322926 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
6322927 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6322928 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6322929 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6322930 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6322931 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6322932 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6322933 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6322934 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6322935 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6322936 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6322937 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6322938 arsenals of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
6322939 if we have to use force it is because we are america we see further into the future
6322940 best recruiting sergeant that the new anti americanism could have hoped for
6322941 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
6322942 if only this picture had been published before the 2000 election gore would be president
6322943 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6322944 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6322945 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6322946 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6322947 sometimes when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys tell them to go out there with all theyve got and win just one for the gipper
6322948 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6322949 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6322950 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6322951 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6322952 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6322953 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6322954 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
6322955 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6322956 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
6322957 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6322958 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january
6322959 his preference yes would be to see his son serve
6322960 in rural minnesota one district is skipping classes every monday to save fuel nationwide at least 14 other districts are switching to four day weeks and dozens more are considering it
6322961 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
6322962 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
6322963 running a hedge fund is harder than it looks on tv
6322964 petite leggy women with big busts are the most sexually attractive study reveals
6322965 protester sheehan and public enemy coming to denver for dnc
6322966 a man being suspended in the air by six metal hooks clamped to his skin during an act at a tattoo convention fell and broke a leg
6322967 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6322968 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6322969 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6322970 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6322971 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
6322972 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
6322973 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
6322974 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
6322975 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
6322976 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6322977 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6322978 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6322979 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6322980 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6322981 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6322982 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
6322983 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
6322984 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
6322985 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
6322986 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
6322987 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
6322988 many in the christian right tend to get their information
6322989 if you look at what the springboks did in the last game they took on new zealand whove been the most successful scrum in the world in the last three years they had them under severe pressure from the very first scrum of the game and they delivered 100 scrum ball themselves
6322990 thats something that they havent done in other tests this year so we believe on the back of last weeks performance this is the best scrum in the world and matfield in the lineout speaks for himself
6322991 i wasnt concerned with our performance there it was a great battle and quality of the ball is what youre after and we were happy with that it took along time for either side to gain ascendancy and we got stronger as the game went on
6322992 james is a rare breed of lock he loves the scrum hes dynamic off the lineout and is great with ball in hand hes scored a number of tries around the park
6322993 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6322994 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6322995 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6322996 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6322997 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6322998 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6322999 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6323000 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6323001 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6323002 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6323003 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6323004 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6323005 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6323006 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6323007 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6323008 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6323009 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6323010 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6323011 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6323012 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6323013 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6323014 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6323015 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6323016 honestly i dont see how this has much to do with your election
6323017 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that
6323018 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6323019 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product
6323020 you put a chinese casket next to a york casket or one of these other manufacturers you cant tell the difference
6323021 sought the endorsement of local labor unions for financial support and votes in the november general election
6323022 needs to fess up to his union supporters about his participation in exporting american jobs to china
6323023 libelous containing many misstatements of fact and stating conclusions that are meant to do nothing but maliciously harm crowder funeral homes
6323024 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6323025 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6323026 it is striking how unqualified sen barack obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6323027 i think this is a classic illustration here where affirmative action has reared its ugly head against them
6323028 but putting things on the skin puts them straight into your blood stream
6323029 try to use products that are as plain as possible
6323030 the fewer ingredients the better and dont trust the labeling claims
6323031 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6323032 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6323033 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6323034 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6323035 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6323036 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6323037 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6323038 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6323039 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6323040 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6323041 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6323042 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6323043 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6323044 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6323045 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now
6323046 i cant rest i understand some of it i dont like people begging me if youre not bothering nobody why do you have to move where do you want me to go
6323047 its too early in the litigation to specify an amount
6323048 he had no insurance and was riding around in a private vehicle with the logo of a pizza place on top of the vehicle
6323049 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6323050 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6323051 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6323052 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6323053 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6323054 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6323055 the amount of fail on theforum com is reaching epic proportions
6323056 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6323057 they told me there are going to be resources here
6323058 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6323059 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6323060 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6323061 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6323062 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6323063 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6323064 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6323065 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6323066 and hopefully voters will give us a chance to improve facilities by voting in favor of a bond issue
6323067 there are still a couple of issues that were wrestling with but that 135 million figure is correct as of the end of wednesday afternoon
6323068 a cultural elite linked to social class does not exist in society
6323069 its education and social status not social class that predict cultural consumption
6323070 i was asked to give a talk to a civic businessmens group on the importance of the arts you know if you dont read one book in your life your head will turn into a pumpkin that kind of thing
6323071 as i waiting for my turn at the podium i looked into the crowd and they were all smiling and shaking hands patting each other on the back talking with food in their mouths and the just looking at them the idea popped into my head serial murders arent necessarily a bad thing i started writing notes on napkins and by the time i got home i pretty much had an outline for the first book darkly dreaming dexter
6323072 at some point my instincts took over and i started writing what felt right i would check it with this psychologist she was a family member and she would yeah right on the money and i realized for whatever disturbing reasons i was kinda tuned into it and unfortunately for him i think
6323073 a lot of people said they did that watched the whole first season on dvd and it made me afraid to go out ive been staying home lately
6323074 the gay brother from are you out of your mind i thought this was going to be another one of those hollywood loop jobs the first day on the set i walked right past him i didnt recognize him because hes a shape shifter you know but the first line i heard him do as dexter it was like bam i knew he was it hes great
6323075 from what i understand dexter is kidnapped by a ufo and dropped off in the middle of washington d c to solve a lot of political problems
6323076 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
6323077 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
6323078 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6323079 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6323080 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6323081 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
6323082 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
6323083 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
6323084 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
6323085 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
6323086 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6323087 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6323088 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6323089 lets do a writing war lets meet and write this way we would simply have to
6323090 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6323091 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6323092 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6323093 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6323094 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6323095 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6323096 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6323097 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6323098 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6323099 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6323100 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6323101 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6323102 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6323103 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6323104 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6323105 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6323106 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6323107 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6323108 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6323109 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6323110 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6323111 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6323112 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6323113 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6323114 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6323115 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6323116 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6323117 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6323118 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6323119 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6323120 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6323121 japanese culture and food were a huge part of my life growing up my mother made sure i knew who i was and where i came from our house was always full of grandparents and aunts and uncles and cousins we ate ozoni a traditional japanese rice soup on new years eve my life was very japanese

6323135 they pushed in a window in the tv room to get in they ransacked the place we havent touched amys room since she disappeared it was a shrine to her theyve turned it upside down and pulled all her clothes out of the wardrobe
6323136 the worst thing is theyve stolen audreys laptop which shed been using in the search for amy it had everything on it poster designs numbers of the irish ambassador in

6323159 but we came late today and were taking it easy
6323160 and we got up this morning and said a few raindrops arent going to stop us
6323161 i was up til 3 oclock in the morning watching the weather

6323170 the phelps thing couldnt have worked better i admire that they got swimming in the morning everything broke their way
6323171 i dont think theres a sense of regret about that
6323172 maybe the timing wasnt right and maybe we werent ready for it the i o c made a sensible decision and nbc was more aggressive with a different calculation
6323173 theres nothing that nbc has that we dont have the assets to replicate and do better
6323174 the olympics have always been an intriguing property for us
6323175 we might look into it but its really too early to talk about a genuine level of interest
6323176 we always believed mobile would take off to the mainstream that there would be eventually be more robust devices better discovery and improved access

6323238 when the newly established local involvement networks links identify concerns about local health or social care services they refer the issues to the scrutiny committee of the local council consultations on the management the new networks has revealed worries about a potential conflict of interest that may result form this arrangement

6323251 the problem is that this portion of the building has been vacant more than 50 years and its decayed that entire time
6323252 in six years with the city ive never had to be a part of this type of decision but health and safety trumps everything in this type of situation
6323253 if someone wants a building down they always say it presents a threat to health and safety but its not always true
6323254 the building may be deteriorating but condemning it and demolishing it is not the only option
6323255 libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr said wednesday that the growth of executive power is one of the main threats facing the united states
6323256 reflecting his modest resources barrs schedule in philadelphia was a limited one beyond a few interviews his only campaign event was an unannounced appearance tuesday at the 18th annual stu bykofsky candidates comedy night in northern liberties
6323257 two days before a hearing challenging his candidacy was set to take place

6323268 it was a favor as huge as we could have gotten it was like a drowning man getting thrown a life preserver
6323269 just when ned was trying to establish himself as a credible alternative on the war barack obama came in and said hey i disagree with him on the war but you should send him back to the senate
6323270 at one call center we received a call from our local utility on the morning after we replaced pcs

6323276 that will depend on what the vets decide this afternoon
6323277 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6323278 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6323279 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6323280 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6323281 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6323282 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6323283 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6323284 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6323285 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6323286 i admire evel knievel because he was the original he invented extreme sports i grew up in france watching the excitement and suspense of his jumps he defied skeptics ignored fear and pushed the limits
6323287 he had several accidents throughout his career but he persisted and we watched and cheered for him every step of the way
6323288 we promise our vendors that we wont reveal the labels but i can say that these are well known names featured regularly on the pages of popular brides magazines
6323289 this is a very important win for our company as it represents another international award this is a testament that our strategy is working with close to 22 million in awards this year and over 80 million in solicitations remaining we are successfully building a platform for growth in the years ahead i believe 2009 will be the companys best

6323293 hes got a bit of a strain in his thigh mitchell said
6323294 its a soft tissue one so if you do try and play and mask it with a jab or anti inflammatory injections you can do more damage
6323295 its just a precaution and we want to make sure hes going to be fit for next week and by playing he might do more damage to the thigh so its important we look after him
6323296 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6323297 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6323298 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6323299 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6323300 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6323301 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6323302 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6323303 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6323304 the power to grant a pardon to repatriated prisoners wrongly convicted in a foreign jurisdiction
6323305 this application for a judicial review is a vital step in securing justice for michael shields it is important that there is legal clarity about who decides his future
6323306 i shall continue to fight for this young man until justice has been done
6323307 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6323308 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6323309 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6323310 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6323311 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6323312 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6323313 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6323314 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6323315 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6323316 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6323317 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6323318 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6323319 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6323320 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6323327 i dont think there will be any downside for consumers

6323403 i would not want a professional judgment of my scientific work to be those seven people who selected me for the award
6323404 it never occurred to me at the time that i was helping to develop machinery that would make possible a government that i would come to criticize severely as too large too intrusive too destructive of freedom yet that is precisely what i was doing my wife rose has repeatedly chided me over the years about the role that i played in making possible the current overgrown government we both criticize so strongly

6323410 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6323411 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

6323417 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6323418 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6323419 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6323420 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6323421 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6323422 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6323423 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6323424 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6323425 i realize that this has caused great concern in the jewish community
6323426 the title makes it clear that the book is about conditions and events in the palestinian territories and not in israel
6323427 we are moving towards a government like that of south africa with a dual society of jewish rulers and arab subjects with few rights of citizenship
6323428 imposing a system of partial withdrawal encapsulation and apartheid on the muslim and christian citizens of the occupied territories
6323429 the driving force of the two peoples is unlike that in south africa not racism but the acquisition of land
6323430 the close relationship israel had with south africa in the diamond trade but commented that the south african system of apartheid could not long survive
6323431 make it clear that they will end the suicide bombings and other acts of terrorism when international laws and the ultimate goals of the roadmap for peace are accepted by israel
6323432 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6323433 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6323434 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6323435 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6323436 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

6323448 i support environmentally responsible development lets make ours the first green port and railroad in america
6323449 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6323450 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6323451 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6323452 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6323453 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6323454 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6323455 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6323456 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6323457 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6323458 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6323459 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6323460 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6323461 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6323462 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6323463 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6323464 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6323465 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6323466 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6323467 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6323468 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6323469 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6323470 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6323471 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6323472 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6323473 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6323474 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6323475 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6323476 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6323477 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6323478 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6323479 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

6323521 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6323522 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6323523 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6323524 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6323525 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6323526 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6323527 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6323528 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6323529 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6323530 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6323531 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6323532 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6323533 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6323534 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6323535 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6323536 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6323537 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6323538 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6323539 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6323540 weve worked long and hard for this moment and wanted our first album to really be something that we are proud of
6323541 la sexualidad de los argentinos a traves de la historia
6323542 quedense que ya volvemos con mas de esta conmovedora historia de vida
6323543 auk tesn s naftos kainos nepadeda eurui ir sterlingui taip kaip gal t
6323544 unfortunately they got the story wrong and missed the real story sitting right under their noses
6323545 surely this study is some sort of anomaly a fluke outcome we already know that zoloft and similar drugs are much more effective than a sugar pill
6323546 hey wait a minute havent i heard of this parasite somewhere before isnt it the one that causes toxoplasmosis that disease pregnant women can catch from cats and pass on to their babies
6323547 depressed people could just snap out of it if they really wanted to
6323548 if you have an eating disorder you were probably sexually abused
6323549 oh well the doctor said i probably have a chemical imbalance or something wrong with my brain so that means i have to take drugs to fix it
6323550 if only someone had the money for a series of slick prime time commercials about behavior therapy weve got to find a way to tell the 6 million ocd sufferers that theres a better treatment out there one alas theyve never even heard of
6323551 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6323552 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6323553 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6323554 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6323555 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6323556 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6323557 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6323558 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6323559 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6323560 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6323561 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6323562 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6323563 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6323564 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6323565 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6323566 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6323567 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6323568 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6323569 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6323570 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6323571 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6323572 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6323573 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6323574 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6323575 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6323576 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6323577 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6323578 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6323579 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6323580 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6323581 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6323582 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6323583 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6323584 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6323585 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6323586 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6323587 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6323588 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6323589 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6323590 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6323591 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6323592 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6323593 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6323594 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6323595 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6323596 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6323597 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6323619 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6323620 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6323621 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6323656 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6323657 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6323658 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6323659 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6323660 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6323661 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6323662 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6323663 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6323664 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6323665 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

6323667 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6323668 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6323669 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6323670 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6323671 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6323672 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6323673 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

6323679 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6323680 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6323681 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6323682 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6323683 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6323684 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6323685 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6323686 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

6323688 there are actually folks out there that think i dont like john mccain
6323689 thats also untrue i really appreciate him being in this race next to him they think im the young guy
6323690 we think thats a tremendous shame because we see that as our role to get those exhibitions but they are very expensive and that is where some of the cuts would come
6323691 theyre not going to be stopped altogether well just do them in other years one or two at a time
6323692 even setting aside the efficiency dividend the costs have increased more than 50 per cent in the last four years of activity to the level now where weve taken a decision to reduce the quality of collecting in that area
6323693 our electricity bill would be 500 000 this year with no appropriation to make up for that
6323694 you cant show the collection in darkness and you cant turn off the air conditioning to preserve a 3 3 billion collection
6323695 people would be horrified if a painting or some relic were stolen and it turned out there was one person on duty or something like that
6323696 if you go to archives for example and wish to get some information you were charged a fee and some fee is reasonable but the pressure on those agencies is to increase those fees
6323697 and the war memorial presumably will be under some sort of pressure to charge fees for additional services
6323698 but to be perfectly honest weve had this arrangement efficiency dividends now for over 20 years

6323717 it is apparent that the incentive of some merger parties changes once an undertaking is accepted and the transaction is completed
6323718 before a merger is cleared the priority of merger parties and their advisers is to get the deal done
6323719 to deal with this problem the accc has had to considerably strengthen the elements that must be included in an undertaking before it is accepted
6323720 the accc has been raising concerns about this publicly for several years but despite our best endeavours we are still finding some in business and some of their advisors are gaming or wanting to challenge the undertakings that are given
6323721 if the gaming of the undertaking process continues the accc will have to seriously look and whether undertakings are an effective solution to dealing with problematic takeovers or whether we need to seriously consider removing them from our consideration
6323722 this can largely be attributed to changes introduced by the accc in recent years to improve the flexibility transparency and effectiveness of the process
6323723 the revised guidelines are intended to explain to the business community and its advisors the process used by the accc to evaluate the competitive effects of mergers the revised guidelines do not change how the accc carries out merger evaluation rather they state how we currently do this evaluation
6323724 despite strong claims from a number of quarters the accc was not presented with evidence that creeping acquisitions were a significant issue in that particular market
6323725 however we did express our support for the introduction of more general creeping acquisitions amendments to the trade practices act to deal with the potential shortcomings of section 50
6323726 we dont like passing through very high price increases directly to customers
6323727 in most surveys coles is very competitive on price but we need to make sure that that survey is reflected in perception
6323728 in some of the other surveys customers arent quite as flattering so we need to win that price trust
6323729 i think well get improved performance from coles by getting more customers into our stores and having them buy more product
6323730 having price trust is a very important part of that
6323731 weve got to become more efficient in the way we operate the business and have to provide better products and services
6323732 were not going to ratchet up our earnings from coles as may have been done in the past by playing with the price lever

6323756 emotional stress has been linked to severe acne episodes and certain factors in a teens life such as getting ready to go back to school trying out for a sports team or fitting into a social niche can cause anxiety and distress i recommend that my younger patients schedule a back to school visit to gain control of their skin before these emotional factors affect them

6323797 its nice just to get done with the paperwork and get out for the first day and kind of see what you have
6323798 we know that were going to start a routine now and see these guys every day in some respects youre just happy to get through the practice plan on the first day the weather was a challenge for us but i think the kids responded pretty well
6323799 well end up having an hour of team time together
6323800 but the rest of the time i felt like i wanted to raise the bar across the board i want them to know exactly what i want it might only last for ten days before we go to a more normal schedule but i wanted to have my hands on every aspect of what we do
6323801 break many properties that is the fundamental advantage of lisp
6323802 you on the other gt hand are apparently not aware
6323803 im trying to focus down to a specific technical point that we might be able to resolve
6323804 im hoping they would get a little desperate but they continue playing like nothing happened
6323805 its crazy weve just been getting better and better each year
6323806 right now were playing our best volleyball and it couldnt come at a better time we didnt practice until a month before the season because we wanted to climb that mountain slowly
6323807 voy a preparar un proyecto para la azotea que no vais a poder rechazar
6323808 ive really enjoyed offering my insights in this field if youd like to why dont we set up a regular time to get together
6323809 we have had a bad day at the office on two fronts i am very disappointed with the manner of the defeat and the goals we conceded were just schoolboy mistakes
6323810 in the first half we played some very good football and could have been further in the lead
6323811 our football certainly deserved more of a reward but we lacked a cutting edge in the second period
6323812 that second half was a very different story and you could see it coming in the end
6323813 we were in trouble almost from the first minute after the break
6323814 and the goals we conceded were shocking defending there was indecision it was schoolboy stuff
6323815 we produced very little up front and we were being out numbered in vital areas
6323816 the game looked to be petering out until that very poor goal we conceded in injury time
6323817 you cannot make that kind of mistake at this level you will be punished there was indecision people were arriving late at the situation and there was hesitancy
6323818 i am concerned by a lot of the things i saw i did not enjoy watching those goals go in
6323819 the centre of our defence gave us a lot of problems it is becoming a major problem
6323820 al se ni iz lo po mojih eljah svoje pa je dodalo e izjemno slabo vreme ki je e v kvalifikacijah zaustavilo mnoge favorite prvi met sem metal tako da gotovo ne bi napravil napake in prestopi v drugem sem el na vso mo vendar mi je spodrsnilo ker na mokrem zaleti u nisem dobil opore tudi zadnji met je bil podoben

6323824 you robbed a blind man as he walked near his home on the treowen estate at newtown
6323825 they could have simply held him and take his possessions but they felt it appropriate to punch him and then kick him while he was on the ground

6323839 nos recuerda constantemente que toda esa obsesiva y subversiva corriente de cine de saldo y subcultura de derribo y su extra a mezcla de belleza y miseria discurre simultanea a lo cotidiano
6323840 es curioso que le resalten la calidad cuando la mitad de lo que habla es sobre como la falta de ella crea momentos sublimes

6323848 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
6323849 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
6323850 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
6323851 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
6323852 our research group is exploiting a tremendous overlap of knowledge from many disciplines yes work will be a pivotal part of anrgs grand scheme
6323853 to solve these problems it takes an entire community of specialists working together
6323854 alterations in brain serotonin levels have been linked to several mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety
6323855 however despite the prevalence of postpartum depression and the frequent use of serotonergic drugs such as prozac and zoloft to treat this disorder a requirement for maternal serotonin function in the mothers behavior toward her offspring had not been convincingly demonstrated until now
6323856 okay i just missed it last time so ill rotate a little more slowly and go in with a smidge less speed
6323857 i just said im going to stomp that mother f cking sh t
6323858 i got a phone call from the fbi around 9 30 p
6323859 when he said that i kind of knew without his saying it that they had warrants
6323860 the only thing remarkable about the agents is how they were dressed two guys in black business suits with those thick black soled shoes that nobody likes thom mcan specials were standing there they were tall really tall all in black
6323861 nobody was in their offices at the time i made the notifications that i would normally make in any operation involving the legislature i was there most of the night the fbi was there most of the night it was a long night it was a long week actually
6323862 this bill was literally a full employment act for lobbyists in sacramento
6323863 every time i turned around i heard someone say hey lou joining you in the fight or it was hey lou nothing personal
6323864 carte blanche authority to diagnose and treat all forms of glaucoma
6323865 its a deal that i dont think any of the parties really like but its not necessarily a deal any of the parties hate either
6323866 but in all fairness you can never underestimate the ability of the legislature to get money from the cities and counties and special districts
6323867 it really is going to hit us if you take away the tax flow
6323868 a large number of claims have been held for more than a year
6323869 counties are not being paid timely and the impact of dmh department of mental health dysfunction is being felt on county operations and programs
6323870 they have a multimillion dollar payroll and the funding is just not coming in
6323871 basically the government shut down the economies in the rural areas
6323872 the reality is that preventing catastrophic wildfires begins with measures like reducing the amount of dried brush dead trees and other woody debris from unmanaged forests on government owned land despite rural residents living in fear that the next fire will destroy their homes businesses and communities the only solution provided thus far is to spend more money fighting fires
6323873 then you have the problem of having to drive 50 miles to get gas
6323874 its huge because rural areas dont have a big tax base it becomes extremely hard on property taxes and to a certain degree looking at sales taxes to fund things
6323875 trinity sierra colusa glenn they do not have the borrowing power
6323876 a timely question for democrats whats more important getting a budget written or going to denver is the timing of the convention the real driver of our state budget negotiations
6323877 measure current attitudes toward california assembly bill 32 also known as the global warming solutions act and to gauge how both positive and negative arguments affect voter support for the bill
6323878 we have been caught by surprise as to how quickly our situation has become public lee said in a statement
6323879 it is with regret that i confirm todays media reports are correct and that liz and i have decided to separate
6323880 given the personal nature of the matter i ask that you please respect our privacy as we attempt to deal with this sensitive situation
6323881 genuinely concerned about the economy and how household wealth was now going backwards after tripling under the howard government
6323882 i am genuinely concerned i think australians are beginning to feel genuinely concerned that less than 12 months after the last election they are going backwards in net terms he said
6323883 well i obviously am representing my constituents and they are concerned he said
6323884 his sufferings must be that of a man who is drowning but cannot drown
6323885 not exceed the total amount of revenues received by that entity for that fiscal year from its authorized taxes
6323886 at least about a quarter of the bill seemed to be focused on local government issues
6323887 its been changed to an extent that i dont think any local government will have a problem with it
6323888 were like matt damon and greg kinnear in stuck on you
6323889 it talks about fees as a logical outgrowth of proposition 13 by restricting the powers of government to tax it really in essence directs the legislature to look for ways to finance government through the imposition of taxes
6323890 certainly at the state level there have been lots of new revenues that in the old days would be called taxes
6323891 at the end of the day we need some sort of budget reform thats got to be the start of the discussion
6323892 deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life
6323893 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured
6323894 at this difficult time all those affected by this tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers
6323895 the prime minister was deeply sorry to hear about todays tragedy in spain
6323896 his thoughts are with the spanish people and all those affected by the tragedy
6323897 it overlooks the fact that fijis intention to attend and participate fully in forum meeting processes in niue and auckland was frustrated and ultimately prevented by the new zealand government
6323898 the selective use of the provision of the biketawa declaration to threaten the suspension of fiji from the forum is not only inappropriate but goes against the principle of inclusiveness and dialogue which is integral to the pacific way
6323899 environment impact and coastal studies have not shown any adverse effects
6323900 to this date however we are still not satisfied with commercial feasibility projections especially forecasts on rates of return the financial models used are being reviewed to ascertain whether there is room for improvement while containing risk
6323901 we are also exploring the possibility of negotiating overseas loan funds on advantageous terms to provide the start up finance
6323902 its not easy but i know one thing if youre able to pull this together there is going to be a flow on effect somebody has to make a start
6323903 if one large company comes here youll find a lot of other companies follow
6323904 thats the only remains of kathryn mckay thats her right foot and ankle
6323905 i put it to you that it is clear that you intended to kill these people
6323906 you intended to kill them and you intended to eliminate any evidence of that crime that would in any way connect you to it
6323907 i wasnt asking questions i just did what i was told
6323908 there could be further upside but it will not be that much because of the poor economic outlook in the west
6323909 that is why we wont see prices falling below 112 a barrel
6323910 i love doors front doors are the first impression the world has of your home and as the saying goes you never get a second chance to make a first impression
6323911 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6323912 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6323913 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6323914 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6323915 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6323916 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6323917 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6323918 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6323919 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6323920 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6323921 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6323922 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6323923 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6323924 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6323925 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6323926 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6323927 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6323928 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6323929 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6323930 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6323931 the venezuelan government actions highlight a lack of respect for the principles of international law and the treaties relating to reciprocal protection of investments
6323932 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6323933 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6323934 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6323935 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6323936 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6323937 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6323938 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6323939 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6323940 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6323941 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6323942 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6323943 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6323944 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6323945 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6323946 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6323947 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6323948 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
6323949 the report makes it clear that truck drivers were gambling with their lives whenever they used the two wells level crossing said ata chairman trevor martyn
6323950 under the australian standard truck drivers should have been able to look north for 600 metres up the railway line to see oncoming trains
6323951 but the vegetation growing next to the track meant that truck drivers could only see for 60m
6323952 in other words they could not see an oncoming train until it was too late to do anything about it
6323953 every day truck drivers gamble with death or serious injury when they go over level crossings with badly placed stop signs and inadequate sighting distances he said
6323954 davvero oh poverina chiss come la prendevano in giro a scuola i suoi compagni
6323955 la poverina tutta la vita che presa in giro da tutti quando venuta da me per una pratica di cambio nome si sfogata del dolore di una vita ed scoppiata in un pianto disperato

6323959 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6323960 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6323961 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6323962 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6323963 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6323964 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6323965 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6323966 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6323967 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6323968 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6323969 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6323970 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6323971 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6323972 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6323973 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6323974 it could be something like a convertible preferred deal that might end up diluting shareholders but at the same time the rest of the capital structure winds up doing ok
6323975 the market sees that takeover as further illustrating the guarantee of the government
6323976 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset housing and losses are off the charts and there are no signs of stability
6323977 that delay will only be possible if the gses continue to be able to sell discount notes and term debt at relatively stable spreads
6323978 the list goes on there are a large number of issues where i put my country first and reached across the aisle
6323979 once the state gets its act together and finalizes the budget if there are take aways i think well have to consider eliminating this as well as other things
6323980 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6323981 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6323982 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6323983 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6323984 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6323985 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6323986 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6323987 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6323988 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6323989 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6323990 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6323991 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6323992 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6323993 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6323994 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6323995 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6323996 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6323997 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6323998 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6323999 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6324000 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6324001 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6324002 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6324003 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6324004 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6324005 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6324006 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6324007 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6324008 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6324009 looking at the team today it should stand us in good stead for the next couple of weeks with the players we have we are capable of playing like that next month
6324010 its the way the players want to play if we can play like that in the next two games we are capable of getting something out of them
6324011 the first half was very good we got to grips with the game in the first 15 minutes but i really thought the 30 minutes before half time was very good
6324012 we played some good football and held control of the ball very well but the conditions in the second half completely ruined the game
6324013 i think we would have kicked on we were in control of the game and we could have scored a couple more
6324014 the pitch absolutely spoiled the second half but we will take the positives from the first half
6324015 we will remember the first half and try to completely forget the second half
6324016 hes a good holding midfielder but hes also always looking for that threaded pass for the strikers which is very good he did that a lot of times in the first half
6324017 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6324018 this is a planning took where all things are going
6324019 qantas continue to have a world class safety record the safety record really is second to none and it is one of the safest airlines and will remain one of the safest airlines in the world
6324020 we do not step away from the fact that the incident on qf30 in manila was very serious
6324021 we have cancelled some flights certainly substituted aircraft and we have delayed some passengers just as every airline does
6324022 repairs are starting now and it will be back in service in november

6324038 dr d thats about the coolest thing ive ever done
6324039 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
6324040 the result is desynchronization if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
6324041 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
6324042 its up to our generation to bring in rock songs

6324079 he has grown in stature over the last year since gary neville has been out injured
6324080 when he was at leeds i thought he was the leader bossing people about
6324081 but when he came to united with big personalities like neville he became a lot quieter and left it to other people
6324082 it was interesting that once neville got injured he took it upon himself to be the voice at the back there are not a lot of captains in the united team and the manager likes to have a few who are vocal he probably had a word with rio and it has had an effect on his game rio has the respect of everybody around him because of what he has achieved in the game
6324083 hes put the problems of a few years ago his contract dispute and the missed drugs test behind him
6324084 when rio first came to united he didnt have a regular partner and that affected his form you need someone you can trust and work with week in week out
6324085 the manager brought in vidic and the pair of them have formed a great understanding they are two different players like steve bruce and i were and it has worked well
6324086 i think it was harder for me because id not established myself in the top flight like rio
6324087 id been relegated with boro and wed conceded a load of goals whereas rio was a regular england international having played for west ham and leeds
6324088 i was seen as a huge gamble and the manager was taken apart after signing me paul ince and danny wallace
6324089 the pressure was different because i wasnt as well known as rio you always feel extra pressure when a lot of money has been spent on you even though youre not the one who demands the fee
6324090 i felt i had to justify the price tag but i think rio was more comfortable dealing with it because hed already moved to leeds from west ham for a big fee and hes certainly handled it well with all the success hes had at united

6324108 to encourage staff and nurses in particular who have children and issues in relation to managing time to either enter or continue into the workforce
6324109 yes i do there are thousands of trained nurses who drop out of the profession because there are no child care facilities at their workplace
6324110 the government are looking at models that introduced unlicensed carers to do the work that has traditionally and for the last 60 or 70 years been done by registered nurses
6324111 it is as much driven by changes in population demographic as workplace issues mr lesley said
6324112 really the ageing population and the demands in wa of a migrating population are driving up the demand for health care services
6324113 to encourage staff and nurses in particular who have children and issues in relation to managing time to either enter or continue into the workforce
6324114 de witte pool b v is een intermediairsbedrijf voor kluswerkzaamheden samen met mijn broertje rob derikx werken wij samen met drie poolse hoofdaannemers en in totaal 22 poolse werknemers wij zijn tussenpersoon bij particuliere verbouwingen de werkzaamheden die wij uitvoeren zijn sloopwerkzaamheden timmerwerkzaamheden stukwerkzaamheden schilderwerkzaamheden isoleren van muren vloeren plafonds en het aanleggen van houten vloeren
6324115 drie jaar geleden heb ik een huis gekocht in amsterdam dat volledig verbouwd moest worden uit de offertes bleek dat nederlandse aannemersbedrijven zeer hoge bedragen vroegen voor verbouwingen twee vrienden uit eindhoven zaten met exact hetzelfde probleem met zn drie n hebben we toen besloten dit bedrijf op te zetten en met poolse werknemers in zee te gaan inmiddels zijn we wegens tijdgebrek van hun kant uit elkaar gegaan vervolgens is rob in het bedrijf gekomen via poolse hockeyvrienden ben ik op poolse vaklui gekomen waarmee we nu intensief en professioneel samenwerken echt heel leerzaam en waanzinnig leuk
6324116 het bedrijf loopt heel aardig het hockeynetwerk is enorm groot en via via krijgen we veel werk aangeboden ikzelf kom uit s hertogenbosch en heb hogere hotelschool gestudeerd in den haag daarna ben ik naar amsterdam verhuisd en heb ik business studies de engelse variant van bedrijfskunde gestudeerd op de universiteit van amsterdam rob studeert rechten in utrecht en hockeyt bij schc in bitlhoven kortom in amsterdam utrecht den haag s hertogenbosch maar ook in hockeystad rotterdam krijgen wij werk aangeboden verbouwen met de witte pool is aanzienlijk goedkoper dan met nederlandse aannemers en doordat er via ons gecommuniceerd wordt is de taalbarriere met de poolse werknemers een stuk minder geworden
6324117 ik studeer in september 2008 af aan de universiteit van amsterdam
6324118 rob en ik kunnen prima leven van ons bedrijf maar doordat we veel in het bedrijf investeren halen we er nog niet veel uit we hebben samen grote plannen na onze hockey carri re om hiermee door te gaan en verder te gaan in het vastgoed hockey is onze hobby en passie van het hockey kan ik goed leven ik heb dan ook net een huis gekocht in amsterdam samen het hoogste bereiken op sportgebied is waanzinnig gaaf maar daarnaast een bedrijf runnen en ondernemend bezig zijn is ook ontzettend leuk en leerzaam
6324119 ja een goed maatje van mij neemt onze honneurs waar als wij met het nederlands team op trainingsstage zijn in de toekomst is de kans aanwezig dat rob en ik gaan uitbreiden maar voorlopig is dat nog niet aan de orde
6324120 nee iedere individu topsporter of geen topsporter heeft zijn eigen kwaliteiten sommige individuen zijn daarom in mijn ogen absoluut geschikt om te ondernemen anderen absoluut niet belangrijk in mijn ogen is dat je het leuk vindt en dat je bereid bent daar alles voor te geven
6324121 in ons team zitten absoluut een aantal spelers die ondernemend zijn jeroen delmee jeroen delmee sports sander van der weide sports in spain matthijs brouwer en taeke taekema hebben ieder een eigen bedrijfje bv of eenmanszaak ik hoop dat ze allemaal succesvol zullen zijn in hun branche

6324127 something in the land imparts flavor wine from one site will taste different from its neighbor
6324128 terroir gives flavor its text the vintner chooses the font
6324129 soil components are like the hour hand on the clock they change only very slowly as agents acting upon flavor they are the least ephemeral
6324130 flavors appear to be locked in the land vintners release them
6324131 minerality as a flavor component is irreducible to literal translation as opposed to say peach or bosc pear
6324132 a bit of lime flowers and minerality you might say these describe the genre of riesling but there are fragrances in here that are beyond the fruit they are sort of para sensual and those we refer to as mineral

6324142 if we dont come into it and offensively make that key pass if defensively we dont help each other and we start reverting back to individuals then we could lose but its going to be tough
6324143 coach k is one of the greatest coaches that we have i try to lead on the court so it wont happen
6324144 what happens is were up one at the end of the first quarter and everyone probably says we knew this was going to happen
6324145 this team here we understand its a 40 minute game sooner or later well impose our will and i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6324146 but our responsibility as leaders of the nation is to seriously examine what are the national consequences to our nation of this radical change in immigration policy
6324147 our first responsibility remains to unemployed australians who might want financial assistance some changes in social security laws which enable and encourage them to take up seasonal fruit picking
6324148 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6324149 if australia is prepared to bring dirt poor people from pacific island nations to do work australians are unable or unwilling to do then surely we are capable of working out some financial assistance to get australians who are unemployed to help them do the work
6324150 why is it beyond the wit of our country to be able to provide the resources and encouragement in supporting australians who are unemployed to go to areas where they can get seasonal work

6324184 a canadian artist cant help but be influenced by canadas climate as each new season interprets its own version of the landscape defining seemingly endless varieties of terrain in breathtaking beauty i too feel compelled to paint my rendition of the spectacle i am constantly awed by serendipitous discoveries from windswept fishing villages to granite outcroppings among waves of forest hills from fragrant marshes teeming with new life to unmarked prairie trails and lush green valleys flanked by mountain sentinels there is not enough time in a billion lifetimes to paint all the possibilities

6324223 look at all those medals in sports that china had never excelled in before
6324224 we have won golds in swimming in archery fencing and even yachting surely it must mean an overall advancement in sports and not just a temporary leap
6324225 an increasing number of gold medals for chinese athletes in an increasingly wider range of sports is because more chinese have developed an interest in the sports that they did not have chances to take part in before
6324226 it is a very good performance but still far from an outstanding one
6324227 if china wants to be a real sport power we need sustained breakthroughs in the sports that we dont consider as our traditional strength
6324228 his setback has made me realise that competing for your country is much more difficult than just defending your personal record the pressure seems to be unbearable
6324229 as i won more and more titles and as more and more people gave me the attention and support i endured more and more pressure
6324230 i cant easily go out and party with friends like people of my age and i feel the expectations from the whole country at all times
6324231 officials from the state general administration of sport once told us that if liu cannot win another gold medal in beijing all of his previous achievements will become meaningless
6324232 china is not yet at a stage of its development that it can afford to train all children in sports and we must select those that are the best at representing the country
6324233 if china wins over the u s it would be because of the bigger population

6324295 when we opened in 69 the average age of our clients was 23 today its probably around 27 and thats taking a lot of people whove been listing their age as 25 for the last six or seven years at their word

6324657 we are killing gerrard we have one of the finest midfielders in steven gerrard he plays for liverpool and he is like roy of the rovers he shoots he scores he tackles he is not a left midfielder it is unbelievable he has to be in the centre that was one of the worst performances i have seen from an england team what positives can you take from that the second half was diabolical they didnt look like the same players who perform week in week out in the premier league what are we doing to them we keep chopping and changing managers and we dont improve ive not seen fabio capello teams play worse than that the players did not perform
6324658 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on i think well be ready for the next game im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances
6324659 it could have been a steve mcclaren tribute night at wembley
6324660 one of the worst performances ive seen from an england team
6324661 england were so poor here that their sponsors took the unprecedented step of voting an opponent jan polak as man of the match
6324662 fabio may not be a wally but neither he nor his players were too clever last night

6324669 berbatov faces a furious spurs backlash after we snapped him signing a manchester united shirt
6324670 only the brolly was missing though fabio capello must have felt every inch the wally on the wembley touchline last night watching england is just like the weather cold wet and horribly predictable this warm up against the czechs poured more cold water on the optimistic notion that under capello it would all be sunshine and light and all the while capello looked on in ignominy penny for his thoughts thatll be more like 5million a year actually the fa paid steve mcclaren just 2 5m a season for cocking it up as badly as this
6324671 a stoppage time equaliser by the substitute joe cole from the muddle ensuing at a corner kick was little comfort indeed it emphasised a dependence on set pieces as the first equaliser had come from the same source the side never flowed steve mcclaren might be compelled to suppress a smile at the confirmation that certain dilemmas are still around to bedevil his successor steven gerrard was on the left as he was against the us in may but it does not suit him and lampard was incapable of flourishing in the centre england cannot afford to go on being so ungainly and disjointed the 2010 world cup qualifiers send england to zagreb next month where croatia will be merciless if england are so inept again
6324672 just in case we were in any danger of getting carried away by team gbs heroics team fabio reminded us last night what english sport looks like when the wheels really do come off it could have been a steve mcclaren tribute night at wembley a wretched performance in the rain and booing on the final whistle from an england support who have had a gutful of insipid football fabio capello applauded in delight when joe cole stole an undeserved equaliser for england in injury time and the italians reaction showed just how far his expectations have fallen in only five games in less than a month england will face croatia in zagreb in their second 2010 world cup qualifier and on this evidence the manager is not just short of a winning formula he does not even know his best team
6324673 redknapp the portsmouth manager said in his role as a television summariser that it was
6324674 i havent seen fabio capello teams play worse than that
6324675 england were so poor here that their sponsors took the unprecedented step of voting an opponent jan polak as man of the match fabio capellos players scrambled a late equaliser joe cole forcing the ball in but it could not mask a myriad failings and a flurry of boos accompanied england from the field
6324676 there were five games into his regime more questions than answers the david beckham conundrum badly at fault for one czech goal and then the set piece creator of englands equaliser the mix in midfield who to play up front the vain hope that one of those strikers might just spark and the perennial underperformance for his country of wayne rooney even the defence creaked badly fabio may not be a wally but neither he nor his players were too clever last night
6324677 what was englands manager thinking when he said only spain impressed him at the european championship what was he thinking when he then declared his side were every bit as gifted as fernando torres and his international colleagues what was he thinking when he celebrated wildly at the sight of the ball bouncing first off petr cechs left foot and a czech defenders face before bouncing over the line skin saved embarrassment avoided not quite fabio because for all the apparent optimism expressed by both the manager and his players england remain very much the team who failed to reach euro 2008 and a team still searching for some much needed confidence
6324678 fabio capello lost the plot lost an ally and almost lost the game on another wretched night for english football
6324679 there is no invention precious little pace and the best chance of scoring remains the same set pieces from david beckham or hoofed long balls joe cole reckoned this week that england are as good as anything that competed at the euros maybe he means on his playstation in reality we are nowhere near the top table of the international game the fans gave their verdict when those left in a half empty stadium booed the team off it was all so horribly familiar
6324680 to say terry looked sluggish would be an insult to slugs appeared unsteady on his feet on the wet ground not for the first time in his life and was twisted and turned by baros at the heart of a defence that was far too easily discomfited by a side deploying a lone striker for the first goal he tugged baross shirt yet the czech forward still turned him with ease and shot
6324681 the players performance here at wembley mirrored so many of those he has put in for his country in recent times the commitment was full blooded the energy levels non stop he tried so hard to make things happen for his team that he put his blood vessels in danger yet when stock was taken and capello will now begin the analysis in earnest as his first competitive fixtures loom the sum total of the damage that rooney inflicted in the final third was negligible in cold hard terms it was limited to a header straight at petr cech on the half hour and a long range shot moments later that the czech goalkeeper made a meal of saving
6324682 they shoehorn the liverpool midfielder into the side and encourage him to slide up and down the greasy pole that has become englands left midfield poor blighter too good to leave out and too flexible to hold down his own position he was stationed out there again last night good ol stevie g get him on the graveyard shift and let him get on with it
6324683 barwick was spotted flying to meet the brazilian then later claimed he had never offered scolari the job once it became clear that he wished to remain with portugal
6324684 barwicks weakness was that he had no record as a stellar businessman as befits an organisation with a turnover pushing 300 million and he was not a stellar footballer so could not be the figurehead that for example franz beckenbauer is for the german federation he is a popular individual though with an impressive range of contacts throughout football but triesman wanted more the furious way he has sought to change the fa in little more than six months in the job suggests he doubted the existing regime from the beginning and most particularly the man at its helm
6324685 a former television executive barwick was not an accomplished performer in front of the press and at one toe curling press conference famously insisted that mcclaren had always been his first choice as england manager he was always likely to struggle against the more slick politically astute triesman who many at the fa regard as just the kind of heavyweight networker capable of representing the organisation in government and around the world

6324779 nothing remains that looks like a plane its horrific everythings burned its a horror i dont want to tell you its the most like hell ive ever seen
6324780 its been very hard emergencies of this kind leave an enormous mark on you
6324781 the problem was that after the plane crashed the area around it was engulfed in flames the firefighters could not get to the plane
6324782 that is why the helicopters came with their water tanks they were putting out the fire
6324783 from my seat i could see smoke coming up from the end of the runway there was a small mushroom cloud as you might expect after an explosion
6324784 when we came in to land the emergency services were alongside our plane as we slowed they overtook us and went straight to the crash scene they were at the scene within two minutes there must have been about 80 or 90 ambulances
6324785 i could see flames coming from the tail end of the plane it looked like the left wing was broken and the aircraft was lying on its side
6324786 the scene is devastating the fuselage is destroyed the plane burnt i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6324787 the plane was set to take off it was late on the second take off attempt there was fire in the motor of the plane which crashed very shortly after take off
6324788 first it could be that something further had gone wrong with the plane after the engine exploded another system may have gone down or there could have been a total loss of power
6324789 second it could be that pilots noticed something wrong and had been panicked into taking a course of action that was very unusual that would be a pilot mistake

6324795 i have not just come here to play and then leave again
6324796 i am here for two years and i want to progress in that time it is my hope that i do well enough for rangers that they want to sign me and keep me here on a permanent deal my first target is to simply play good football in training and get into the team as i am here to be successful
6324797 i am not even thinking about a life beyond rangers you never know what will happen in your career over time but i want to be here i am only focused on working hard so that the club takes up its option to buy me and i am here for many years
6324798 in coming here after a loan spell elsewhere i suppose i am doing the same sort of thing as mikel did before
6324799 its tough to be a success in football and you have to take things step by step when you look at mikel now he is a big success in the english premier league and i want to take things gradually so that i end up being a big success here
6324800 there is no doubt we will go up there this weekend with the result on the final day of last season still fresh in the memory
6324801 we need to get a bit of revenge for that as it was a painful night for all of us and we will be desperate to come back with three points this time around
6324802 when we lost up there in may i dont think the circumstances helped us we looked jaded and you cant forget the run of games we had in the lead up to that one there is never any excuse at rangers for losing games but that was an incredible run of very important matches we had and that night at pittodrie was still painful even though our defeat was irrelevant with celtic winning
6324803 it will be a difficult game for us this weekend it always is up there

6324809 the main focus is to grow the site to appeal to retailers at the moment it is used by very few retailers and ebay sees potential in growing itself as a platform for anyone to buy anything

6324811 it was totally unrecognisable just a skeleton of twisted metal with bodies flung in all directions over a wide area a lot of them were children
6324812 the corpses were being roasted and we were burnt trying to recover them
6324813 she told me the flight had been delayed for an hour following a red light alert but it was now taking off then she said the plane was juddering about and the line went dead
6324814 i saw an airplane in front of me it seemed to be landing i looked at it from the side and what caught my attention was the fact that it was trailing an immense cloud of sand in its wake
6324815 but then i realised that it had taken off from the runway and i was scared i slowed down and when the plane suddenly veered to the right its right wing crashed to the ground at that point there was a big explosion
6324816 i feel a deep sense of grief as madrid has once again suffered
6324817 identification could take until thursday which only compounds the suffering of families

6324819 a spanair mcdonnell douglas md 82 registration ec hfs performing flight jk5113 from lanzarote ci to madrid sp spain diverted to las palmas ci spain due to a generator failure about 30 minutes into the flight
6324820 air traffic control understood that an engine had failed and activated a full emergency response the landing was normal passengers disembarked normally after repairs the flight resumed and arrived in madrid with a delay of 4 hours
6324821 the first half was very good we got to grips with the game in the first 15 minutes but i really thought that the 30 minutes before half time was very good we played some good football and held control of the ball very well
6324822 but i think the conditions in the second half completely ruined the game we were in control of the game and could have scored a couple more
6324823 unfortunately we dont want to concede any goals to any team well remember the first half and try to completely forget the second half looking at the team today it should stand us in good stead for the next few weeks
6324824 with the players we have were capable of playing like that next month its the way the players want to play if we can play like that in the next two games were capable of getting something out of them

6324851 i was upset because i had my beard for so long and when it started falling out i shaved it off i thought i looked like dracula with pointy ears i was first diagnosed october 12 months ago and ive had a lot to go through since then
6324852 it was a terrible blow when it came as time goes on you dont get over these things but you have to try and live with them as best you can and try and live for other people so i am doing the best i can

6324927 todd and shonnah bentley are presently experiencing significant friction in their relationship and are currently separated we want to affirm that there has been no sexual immorality on the part of either todd or shonnah nor has there ever been
6324928 we have discovered new information revealing that todd bentley has entered into an unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff in light of this new information and in consultation with his leaders and advisors todd bentley has agreed to step down from his position on the board of directors and to refrain from all public ministry for a season to receive counsel in his personal life

6324931 three years ago he did the exact same thing he grew out of his relationship to his wife and transferred his affection to another the bottom line is that he was traveling too much and not taking care of his wife and family like he should
6324932 i was involved in a restoration process to help todd a couple years ago in this very area
6324933 i have known todd for several years and have seen god work mightily through him
6324934 has chosen to do something that is wrong according to scripture
6324935 the holy spirit who is perfect must use imperfect people even in revival
6324936 not allow the seeds of hope and healing that were sown into you there to be uprooted by this leaders mistakes it was god who touched you and no one can take that away unless you allow it

6324943 the power of the early church that we read about in acts is an example of the normal christian life the way it should be and thats the blueprint for us and our lives too but the new dimension of this christian life will be even greater have faith in the god who does miracles

6325065 nung nalaman ko na sasali si chairman fernando muntik na akong mag backout
6325066 so naisip ko na marami rin ang inis sa kanya so may chance pa kami so huwag nang sample surprise na lang
6325067 meron pa akong isang reason kung bakit hindi ako nag backout may bagong inspiration ako kaya hindi na ako magba backout
6325068 when i first found out i was in a coffee shop
6325069 playing football you learn if you want it the most youll succeed so i need to prove that i wanted it the most i need to want it more than all of you fellow contenders although i know all of you also want to win i need to prove i wanted it the most salamat po
6325070 the institution of caste is a system at war with truth and nature
6325071 the untouchable was not allowed to use the public streets if a hindu was coming along lest he should pollute the hindu by his shadow
6325072 the untouchable was required to carry strung from his waist a broom to sweep away from behind the dust he treaded on lest a hindu walking on the same should be polluted
6325073 many of the dalits want out of the heinous caste system
6325074 politicians have not delivered dalit atrocities are mounting by the day in many places the state is a mute spectator what is written in the constitution does not work itself out in the villages and towns of india where dalit women are raped abused tortured paraded naked and humiliated
6325075 are accurate regarding the revolt of 250 million against the caste system
6325076 it is not accurate to say that all were immediately turning to christ but the exodus from low caste into christianity was genuine and it continues an estimated 45 million have converted in the past 10 years there is a genuine awakening of the holy spirit and new testament christianity of massive proportions
6325077 hindu extremist opposition is directly related to the dalit exodus from the caste system
6325078 some 100 000 people have turned to christ as a result
6325079 i foresee the dalit exodus and empowerment getting stronger and stronger i also foresee the church being persecuted more not less anti conversion laws have been passed in seven states so far
6325080 may push the dalits into a civil war they will not be kept as slaves
6325081 yes there is hope the global community is more aware that caste is alive and well in india international forums in the u s the u k and at the un have brought up the issue the church of christ has responded worldwide
6325082 i was frequently made aware of what it meant to be in the highest caste
6325083 it was a revelation of how caste has governed indian life i had no idea what had been taken away from these people

6325087 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6325088 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6325089 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6325090 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
6325091 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
6325092 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
6325093 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future

6325215 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people
6325216 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
6325217 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly by comparing the genes of this strain with other strains we were able to identify the two calcium taste genes
6325218 it remains to be seen if what we have discovered in mice the existence of two calcium taste genes holds true for humans we know people have the sweet taste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calcium sensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function

6325245 i remember the first thing that came across was that mention of

6325271 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable
6325272 it really is a case of hidden nature revealing itself to the world after remaining in splendid isolation for so long and demonstrates how important our built structures can be for wildlife discoveries like this are rare and its a chance for us to celebrate the amazing nature of wildlife
6325273 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk accidentally it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife as it has taken one hundred years to get from the balustrade to the house so we re now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden

6325284 we didnt always agree with mr musharraf for instance we didnt agree with the state of emergency several months ago but president musharraf served well as an ally in the war on terror
6325285 we want to help them in terms of social development educational reform all of the things that they want to do

6325288 passengers are very excited about it theyre calling it a game changer
6325289 i am here just to collect the cheque they have already announced that i would receive the reward i dont want to comment anything on politics i dont know much about it
6325290 the reward will encourage me to work harder i am so touched by the support shown by the people and the government
6325291 but it is a heavy responsibility to be a datuk i hope to do better in the future
6325292 we are the first to show that you can do this to a single electron in a self assembled quantum dot if you re going to do quantum computing you have to be able to work with one electron at a time
6325293 this dark state is a place where information can be stored without any error
6325294 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security that means if we sent up a satellite today it would take somebody about 20 years to crack the code quantum computers will let you develop a code that would be impossible to crack with a conventional computer
6325295 if we have this much evidence available to us now
6325296 climate change is a subject usurped by the global elites to progress the establishment of one world government it is primarily advocated by the same groups that control the fiat monetary system and control the entities we call the federal reserve banks the primary agenda is not to alter the worlds climate as the science overwhelmingly states that we have very little influence on the climate the changes we have experienced are natural and primarily influenced by the suns activity the agenda is to establish a carbon market whereby they not only control the worlds monetary supply they would also control the ability of a country to produce anything they would do this by either releasing carbon permits or withholding them exactly the same way these independent entities control interest rates and the supply of money into the economy if you didnt already know it the federal reserve banks are owned and controlled by private entities in reading the australian governments white paper on this subject you will see the carbon permits are to be controlled by a independent body who will have the power to control the issuance of these permits to the market the establishment of an open carbon market whereby these permits can be traded will be a disaster those on the inside will reap huge profits by gaming the system the general population however will suffer enormous financial consequences when these markets are manipulated and the cost of industry gets pushed higher and higher just look at the current turmoil in the financial markets and imagine what happens when the same thing happens in a carbon market where if you cant afford the carbon permit you cant produce anything
6325297 do you believe there is a global conspiracy amongst scientists to usher in a new world order under the smokescreen of climate change
6325298 a cooling bias over millions of years that is progressively sequestrating co2 and depleting atmospheric co2
6325299 i believe the pastoral industry in this area has huge opportunity for development and expansion and i think theres a lot of opportunity for producers to increase and improve their business and start diluting some of the costs that are rolling in
6325300 the properties i have worked with would suggest that potentially 50 per cent increase is in stock numbers with additional development is doable theres opportunity to develop places for capacity for millions of additional cattle
6325301 i believe they are scared because there has been so many subdivision applications been put forward and they really dont know how to handle it
6325302 i heard some lame excuse of why they couldnt meet is because they wanted to meet in darwin and they couldnt get accommodation
6325303 why cant they meet in katherine i know of two we have still got to submit ours but i hear that there are quite a few subdivision applications
6325304 according to the governments standards of carrying capacity there is no way we can do that yet we have the potential of bringing three businesses into an area that was for so many years under utilised left fallow and nothing happened to it
6325305 the baseline of carrying capacity has to be 3 500 aes they are talking about upping it to 5 000 aes because of increased fuel prices supplement prices steel prices
6325306 a farmer would not be able to make a living
6325307 i disagree with that if you manage the land look after the land you can make a living off the land
6325308 i think one of the real difficulties with castration is obviously its an invasive procedure and so there are some concerns around those and thats developing
6325309 so if we were actually able to remove the need for that procedure at all that would sort of be the ultimate in terms of managing the potential welfare issues and again the potential for production issues in terms of the recovery and the healing of the animals in that period

6325343 what i can do is do a courtesy exchange but it wont happen again cause there is not an issue with 3g
6325344 using the iphone on a network it is not designed for may break the iphone
6325345 oh no sir we inform all our customers before we sell them the 3g iphone
6325346 well no one informed me i wouldnt have bought one had i known but i guess thats the plan wouldnt sell as many phones if people knew the truth lying by omission is still lying
6325347 as much as the chip may be the chief problem glitches may also stem from apples software or the at amp t network part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available according to this person the problems are only occurring in areas of high iphone density these include the san francisco bay area boston and certain overseas locales the reason the problem has gotten worse in recent days is because of the steep increase in iphone activations in these places the more people who are trying to use a given piece of gear the more likely they are to get bumped
6325348 im having the same problem and i live in the pocket area of sacramento i called att and they told me it was not the phone but the 3g network it would be interesting to have other 3g phones in the same exact area and see if they are also having the same problem if the other phones are having the problem then its the network 3g if not then it has to be the 3g i phone so lets see how long it will take this issue to be resolved so we may enjoy our i phones
6325349 i can happily report that ever since we have done the sim swap routine we now have three working iphone 3gs
6325350 any idea why my service wouldnt have 5 bars one mile from a tower
6325351 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
6325352 what i was told was that 90 of the disconnects are initiated inside the phone which would exonerate at amp t
6325353 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
6325354 apple released a patch we dont know if it works or not
6325355 heres an example iphone 1 no service iphone 2 106 dbm iphone 3 103 dbm iphone 4 no service iphone 5 106 dbm swisscom field test equipment nokia 3g transceiver 72 dbm swisscom field test equipment samsung 3g receiver 74 dbm swisscom field test equipment s e 3g receiver 76 dbm swisscom usb 3g stick hp notebook 71 dbm swisscom pc card dell notebook 79 dbm
6325356 the problem is affecting 2 to 3 of iphone traffic the people say that compares with a dropped call rate of around 1 for all traffic for at amp t
6325357 further to our telephone conversation on 20th august 2008 i can confirm that a case has been raised with apple with regards to the signal and service issues with their new 3g iphones apple have advised that they are presently working on a fix for this issue and hope to have resolved with the latest software updates
6325358 look we know there is a global problem going on were working on it

6325380 youre still the same person so you want to do the same things youve done before
6325381 its to come from an accident and say i can still do it if i work hard i think thats the most important thing to believe in yourself to set goals and to never give up

6325400 our understanding is that he was released from custody when mexican courts ruled that he couldnt be extradited because the statute of limitations had run out
6325401 the warrants for beltrans prosecution here remain valid and active should he ever fall within our jurisdiction the sacramento district attorney will prosecute
6325402 we were really hoping that justice would be served and people could get their day in court
6325403 to be denied justice by mexican authorities is tough to swallow
6325404 having just sat through a deposition of a father beltran victim yesterday who was molested over 100 times i am extremely disappointed
6325405 each case is evaluated on a case by case basis and when it is done as a penalty it must be for a grave reason

6325412 the army corps of engineers continues to find reasons to cause delays for expediting the permits to protect 70 000 natomas residents
6325413 people are at risk and it is absolutely unacceptable that an additional year will be needed to get 100 year protection
6325414 it is hard to do any long term regional planning if there are outcomes such as this

6325426 there are definitely challenges in the wilderness for anyone with a mobility device but being on the water creates a level playing field

6325432 the marine corps does not tolerate any misconduct from its marines because its not in keeping with our core values of honor courage and commitment

6325434 i thought i knew the marine corps and what they were about
6325435 currently were not aware of any breach in our policies or procedures
6325436 as we get more information well obviously look very deeply into it and make sure were safeguarding the safety and security of our students

6325442 its dreaming to imagine smart international operators wont build a dozen escape hatches into any ppp scheme to ensure they dont end up carrying the losses if things go awry
6325443 the metronet loans would have been much cheaper to finance had the whole thing been done through the public sector yet under the terms of the ppp the government was obliged to redeem the great bulk of them in any case
6325444 the primary justification for the ppp that it would transfer the risk of the project on to the private sector be more efficient and enable expenditure that the public sector couldnt otherwise afford was shown to be a sham

6325448 asked me to let you know that he will not be returning to philadelphia when his term as governor is over
6325449 it seems with city council banning trans fat in philadelphia the governor feels there really is no reason for him
6325450 he was dehydrated and he actually started to feel better last night around midnight we talked to him again this morning but we determined that he just wouldnt be ready to compete

6325455 were trying to deter thieves but if they do this there will be a paper trail that we can follow and hopefully catch the bad guys
6325456 right after i was elected in 2006 i was invited to lunch and i found out when i got there that i was lunch because farmers were very upset about the loss of their pumps and damage to their crops
6325457 last year i went out to turn on my ag pump and i realized the copper wiring had been stolen
6325458 i got it fixed but before i could turn the pump on the next day the metal had been stolen again
6325459 2 500 worth of damage for what people would consider 60 worth of scrap metal
6325460 we think this will be a serious deterrent for both the meth heads who are stealing the merchandise and the people who are taking their merchandise
6325461 were disappointed that we wont achieve the 764 million in savings this month
6325462 the controller has said from day one that he will continue to pay state workers their full salaries unless theres a court order that he cannot
6325463 we believe its time to settle the question of how state employees get paid during a budget impasse
6325464 i think it takes us backward because it creates the impression that taxes are acceptable theyre not and that there are votes for it which there arent
6325465 republicans must step out of their ideological corner on the right and democrats must step out of their ideological corner on the left
6325466 its a fiscally responsible compromise with reforms that fix our system once and for all
6325467 when somebody is drowning you throw them a life preserver not a cinder block
6325468 two billion dollars more in cuts slashing education spending and rolling back worker protections is not a compromise
6325469 anything that makes billions in additional cuts to schools and students isnt a good compromise
6325470 the governor needs to stop trying to solve the budget crisis on the backs of workers
6325471 democrats need to understand its as far as republicans are willing to go

6325482 i was going to have at least double if not triple the rents
6325483 the economy is so bad and people are getting hit from the left and right so badly i dont want to have to go up in prices on anybody
6325484 we wanted to keep it as low as we could if we stay wed have to go way up and would lose half our customers probably if we went up
6325485 it would have been nice if wed had notice or at least a graduated increase
6325486 we expect those first floor storefronts to be retail thats very important to downtown if something cant be worked out with this property owner maybe something could be worked out with another property owner so they could stay

6325505 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent

6325509 honestly i dont see how this has much to do with your election
6325510 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that
6325511 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6325512 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product

6325518 the discrepancy we found between the models and the satellite data adds to an emerging body of evidence suggesting that models may underestimate the increases in intense rainfall in response to human caused warming
6325519 when we looked more closely at the results the models appeared to underestimate the response of the heaviest rainfall frequency to warming
6325520 it is crucial to test the fidelity of such projections using observations
6325521 our strategy was to use the natural periodic changes in global temperature associated with el nino southern oscillation enso to examine the response of extreme precipitation events to changes in climate
6325522 warmer air holds more moisture about seven per cent more for each degree centigrade rise in temperature
6325523 warmer air is therefore likely to also enhance the intensity of convective rainfall at a similar rate
6325524 if latent heating is more than radiative cooling the atmosphere will warm up and become more stable thus inhibiting convection and reducting latent heating to balance again
6325525 the slow rise in radiative cooling constrains average precipitation to rise only at one to three per cent for each degree centigrade of warming
6325526 since average precipitation is constrained to rise at a slower rate than convective region precipitation rainfall in the drier regions away from convection must diminish

6325528 is either using incredibly poor and misleading language or is outright deceiving the public
6325529 my concern is if he is this careless with the facts and so cavalier with the truth should he be on the bench
6325530 in 28 years of elected office ive declined to publicly involve myself in judicial races
6325531 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this

6325533 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6325534 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now

6325544 i think weve made a better record now than we would have two years ago
6325545 when we were with capitol or when we had all these opportunities and offers thrown at our feet
6325546 there were all these ridiculous ideas about doing two songs in buenos aires and two songs in iceland the world was our oyster and we could do anything we wanted but i think weve made a very real record and a very human album and perhaps that might not have been the case if wed been able to throw a lot of cash at it
6325547 we certainly learnt a lot given the extra time weve been together
6325548 we realised that as far as energy goes weve never really bettered our original demos and so the way we made this record was to stick all the amps in a room point em inwards and capture it like that
6325549 theres mistakes all over it that no one bar us will be able to notice but thats all part of it we wanted it to be natural and to do it that way and weve been playing together as musicians for a while now so it wasnt really a challenge the opening song on the record down here so long i believe the bed track for that was the first take we walked into the room did it walked back and it sounded great so we moved on
6325550 i certainly dont labour over it and i dont think thom does either
6325551 i know how id like it to sound and thats where tony cohen comes in hes an expert at capturing great guitar sounds he excels at mic placement and microphone choices and everything just sounds so rich on the record its something that has developed in the rehearsal space and live and we went in there and blasted it out and then to have someone like tony do it made it work
6325552 given everything that weve had in the past with the hype getting out of control and being detrimental i dont want to sound unpatriotic but its a very australian thing the tall poppy thing i really believe in this record as someone who is a music lover but i think there was a perception out there about us being a bit more of a fashion band or whatever but we wanted to make a record that we would love
6325553 wed love to be back in the studio by the end of this year working on the next record
6325554 were in a lucky position in that given the time that weve been together weve written a lot of songs and weve got the material for another record already but weve been working on new ones lately and thatll be the trend to write new songs for a new record so that theyre as fresh as can be
6325555 his writing seems far more aggressive than the person it comes from really is this is a function of its sheer power and its ability to carry several meanings at once some of them working only on the subconscious of the reader

6325560 the best feature of the hill climb is that you can make it whatever you want
6325561 at the front its full out peloton style bike racing but farther back its more casual like a charity ride or a 100 mile century ride you can stop take photos chat up the guy next to you on the mountain bike either way theres the party at the top
6325562 its for first timers take your timers and anybody whos just trying to get their butt to the top any way they can

6325566 this photo was taken at dusk below the old lighthouse in port townsend on a weekend getaway
6325567 the monochromatic palette in this photo spreads evenly between sky land and lighthouse in a soft painterly way the photographer used his vantage point to hide the landmark behind the hillside and capture the clouds shrouding the sun using these natural elements and choosing a unique crop made this a beautifully haunting image

6325580 there are a lot of interesting things here worth saving and preserving
6325581 they provide places they can rest hide from predators and eat
6325582 rather than keeping people away from habitat areas we want to make them more publicly accessible
6325583 this is not too far away from where i live and i didnt even know about it
6325584 you wouldnt think youd see so much wildlife in such an industrial setting

6325596 the u s o c explained that athletes are free to choose their religious preferences and it cannot be a condition of participation on any team or camp
6325597 some athletes do have an athlete generated daily bible session at the o t c but participation is voluntary as far as the u s o c knows and the coach does not attend
6325598 but for me this is the best answer so thats why im encouraging people to be the same as me

6325727 about a month ago an analyst was asking me about the e prescribing legislation and trends and how that would impact the financials of the pbms i told her that i remained a little bit of a skeptic for several reasons
6325728 in this way bulgarian production is killed i start believing that there is such a conspiracy
6325729 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6325730 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6325731 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6325732 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6325733 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6325734 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6325735 you know if you have a big shade tree shades good to a point
6325736 but if theres too much shade then the grass doesnt get to grow
6325737 we always talk about leadership on this team or lack thereof
6325738 this decision is going to be based on who we feel at this point gives us the best chance to win
6325739 it just shows that we believe in him to be our guy
6325740 he and shaun are going to go out there and compete and the winner of that is going to be a good quarterback for us
6325741 all were doing is keeping the same process weve been using
6325742 i dont get to make the evaluation all i can control is how well i play and how hard i play so i try to do those things as well as i can do them
6325743 im going out there treating it like that you have to
6325744 we cant get caught up in worrying about clinching the title we just need to play
6325745 you have to hand it to fresno because their starters played a great game and didnt give up
6325746 home runs arent automatic so you got to hand it to mcclain
6325747 he hit a pitching mistake which is what hitters are supposed to do and it made the game a lot closer
6325748 he got us back into the game and i just got a good pitch and was able to help the team
6325749 personally i think those games are good for us it keeps the juices flowing and everyone playing fundamental baseball
6325750 they will let jamarcus russell unleash the cannon once he shows he can protect the ball and that our o line can protect
6325751 that was disappointing because it was third down and it wasnt even a hard count
6325752 that has been talked about this offseason a lot with them and its somewhere that we have to improve and through two games in the preseason we have improved in that we need to continue to improve in that
6325753 you can say as much as you want ball gone ball gone when its got to be gone but its not the same as getting hit in the back of the head when you hold on to it too long thats why were playing him a lot in the preseason
6325754 i normally wouldnt play that offensive line that long because im so worried about those guys with injuries
6325755 but they need to play with jamarcus because you cant put jamarcus in there with the seconds
6325756 how health professionals found used and experienced the library looking at facets of user experience including findability usability usefulness credibility desirability and value
6325757 evidence based online resources can be improved by applying existing principles for web usability prioritizing the development of simple search functionality emitting
6325758 its like the fascination that young people have here with football
6325759 two years back when i would talk to people about cricket people hardly knew anything about it
6325760 today we actually have people who come and watch our matches
6325761 at first it seems a little complex because its like a one inning baseball game where everyone gets to bat
6325762 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6325763 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6325764 john sitting next you is all the stimulation i need to stay awake for one minute
6325765 no no john you americans ask for drug testing but there will be no drug testing for us
6325766 la idea es reforzar la identidad de todos los inmigrantes y convertir la sala en un lugar de encuentro entre los mismos extranjeros y entre stos y los espa oles
6325767 ahora tendremos dos m s en las bibliotecas municipales de almu car y loja ya tienen todo el material s lo falta la inauguraci n oficial
6325768 estudiantes for neos y poblaci n trabajadora que generalmente se llevan cuentos para sus hijos
6325769 creo que uno de los objetivos principales de esto es romper la rigidez de las relaciones entre inmigrantes porque los chinos se suelen juntar con los chinos los senegaleses con los senegaleses y los ecuatorianos con los ecuatorianos
6325770 a leer los peri dicos y las revistas de f tbol

6325773 se les realizan pruebas antropom tricas una prueba de esfuerzo y anal ticas de sangre y orina y con los resultados que obtenemos sacamos conclusiones tanto de cu l es el porcentaje graso magro y observamos cuales son sus umbrales ideales tanto aer bicos como anaer bicos y el volumen de consumo de ox geno que son valores que nos indican el estado f sico de los jugadores
6325774 los cuatro han llegado muy bien est n en su peso y se encuentran dentro de los valores normales de pretemporada

6325777 my friends all think its really fun that they know what we are doing for my birthday but i dont
6325778 i am looking forward to being surprised and my friends say its going to be cool no would rather be surprised i love surprises
6325779 the economy is probably going sideways with very little growth so people are gradually gravitating back toward energy and basic materials as safer places
6325780 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6325781 china is a very important economy both regionally and globally
6325782 i think indian stocks are starting to find bottom around that 13 000 14 000 level the big problem for india is inflation which remains in the system and that is prompting speculation of further interest rate increases from reserve bank of india
6325783 siempre que los tr mites se cumplan y est todo dentro de la legalidad
6325784 no es lo mismo dar servicio a 10 000 personas que a 50 000 se produce un importante aumento en el n mero de visitantes al que tambi n hay que darle prestaciones que valen dinero y un ayuntamiento que posee presupuesto para 10 000 personas dif cilmente podr atender a 50 000 si no es con ayudas supramunicipales
6325785 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6325786 there hasnt been any confirmation and the testing is ongoing its quite difficult because listeria has an incubation period between two and 30 days and it has been up to 90 days

6325794 en mi casa siemprese ha vivido el mundo del toreo mi padre y mi abuelo fueron banderilleros y los abuelos de mi padre tambi n vamos yo soy el quinto fandila que se dedica al toreo as que desde peque ito siempre he estado jugando al toro ahora el toreo es mi forma de vida y a lo que le debo todo lo que tengo
6325795 desde luego el torero es una persona que nace y se hace porque tienes que nacer con algo dentro la ilusi n las ganas pero luego te vas depurando mucho adem s los toreros sin tener que ser personas muy distintas a las dem s s es cierto que por ejemplo aunque seamos j venes maduramos muy r pido
6325796 el miedo es algoque siempre se tiene en muchos mbitos de la vida pero en el mundo del toro se palpa a n m s no s c mo explicarlo m s que el miedo al animal se tiene miedo a defraudar a no ser capaz de afrontar las adversidades pero es un miedo que eres capaz de superar y de darle la vuelta el valor es algo muy de cabeza por l gica no se har an cosas que se hacen en el toreo pero la mentalizaci n es muy grande y el valor sale de ah de la preparaci n despu s est la capacidad de cada uno de superar las dificultades y los miedos y hay quien tiene m s o menos valor
6325797 el triunfo es algomuy bonito es con lo que siempre se sue a con triunfar con disfrutar y con hacerte un sitio en una profesi n tan complicada y tan bonita como esta yo creo que la base del xito es conseguir metas sentirse feliz con lo que uno hace y conseguir que la gente que te rodea y que va a la plaza disfrute con algo que t sientes
6325798 lo mejor del toreoes disfrutar cuando uno cuaja un toro y se siente a gusto en la plaza cuando sientes que miles de personas disfrutan con lo que t haces llega un momento en que la satisfacci n personal que est s viviendo no se cambia ni se compara con nada
6325799 existe mucha rivalidad hoy en d a en el toreo y aunque te lleves bien y haya compa eros con los que tienes una relaci n fenomenal y con los que comentas y hablas cuando sale el toro lo que tratas es de solucionar tu tarde y de forjarte un futuro y es una situaci n que tienes que defender t cuando sale el toro de cada uno aqu nos olvidamos de los amigos y eso es bueno y bonito es positivo que un torero se crezca viendo a otro y que cada uno en su forma sin imitar a nadie haga su toreo y la gente pueda ver dentro de diferentes conceptos toreros con ilusi n y con ganas de abrirse paso
6325800 cada persona es unmundo pero para m el d a que toreo los peores momentos los vivo cuando ya te han terminado de vestir llegas a la plaza y est s esperando antes de hacer el pase llo ah te rodea mucha gente y todo el mundo quiere hablarte y estar a tu lado pero para m es de los momentos m s delicados despu s cuando haces el pase llo parece que rompe un poco la tarde y se rompen muchas tensiones
6325801 los toreros somos personasque estamos siempre rodeados de mucha gente de mucho bullicio en los hoteles todo el mundo corriendo con prisas la plaza sin duda hay momentos en los que necesitamos desaparecer del mundo irnos al campo y tener un poco de paz no s si de soledad pero s de tranquilidad en los momentos de soledad que vives por ejemplo en el hotel es distinto en esos momentos intentas poner la mente en otra cosa para que las horas te pasen m s amenas tambi n hay veces que toreas en sitios importantes y entonces piensas en lo que te gustar a que pasase en la plaza
6325802 cuando toreas no piensas en sufrir por nadie bastante mal se pasa delante del toro para empezar a sufrir antes de tiempo aunque s es cierto que lo pasas un poco mal por tu gente por los que te aprecian y quieren esta es una profesi n en la que te vas del hotel y no sabes c mo vas a volver no hay un gui n determinado todos los d as tiras una moneda al aire y t a lo mejor no lo piensas pero los que te quieren como mi madre por ejemplo s de hecho para ellos es la primera llamada cuando llego al hotel para mi novia y mi madre

6325809 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6325810 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs

6325820 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it were the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6325824 tindakan kerajaan yang kelihatan tergesa gesa membawa rang undang undang akta identifikasi dna ke parlimen isnin lalu juga jelas menggambarkan usaha terdesak mereka untuk melengkapkan konspirasi tempang ciptaan umno bn untuk menyekat kemaraan datuk seri anwar untuk memimpin rakyat malaysia selepas 26 ogos depan
6325825 jika benar akta tersebut telah digubal semenjak tahun 2001 sebagaimana didakwa oleh menteri dalam negeri dan perdana menteri sendiri mengapa ia perlu mengambil masa hampir lapan tahun untuk digazetkan sebagai undang undang
6325826 amk mencabar kerajaan untuk membariskan kes kes jenayah yang menghadapi masalah untuk memperoleh sampel dna sebelum kes liwat ciptaan umno bn ke atas datuk seri anwar ini mengambil tempat pada 28 jun 2008 lepas bagi membuktikan akta ini mempunyai kepentingan yang mendesak

6325863 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability

6325899 that was published in the herald dated march 30 in fact this is not the first time such messages of plight from fellow catholics have been published but it is regrettable that all such pleas seemed to have fallen on deaf ears having my own children in college i appreciate the tremendous influence of the secular world on our young students who are away from home unless they are reinforced with the right values both human and spiritual the chance going astray is high the plight of a former student is real and i fully agree with him that the catholic church is facing a risk of losing a significant number of catholic students at the tertiary level to other faiths we have been under the wrong pretext that being actively involved in the church organizations is all that is required to withstand the temptations of the material world it could have been true before but definitely not so in our modern era of the internet where all the good values that we cherished have become irrelevant a former student is very true in saying being active in church activities singing in the choir memorising facts and prayers will not make our faith bullet proof it is also a delusion to think that praise and worship charismatic prayer group and other feel good factors will sustain the youngsters faith

6325907 declining stock market prices reduce the value of the assets under management and consequently undermine the resulting earnings and so long as negative sentiment prevails new money will flow in tardily the repercussions of the financial market crisis are not so marked on the consultancy side of our business and we once again recorded a higher number of new clients as expected the additional services provided by the newly founded vz depositary bank have helped stabilise and even moderately expand revenues
6325908 if financial markets fail to recover sustainably during the second half of the year we will not be able to achieve our mediumterm growth target of 20 on total revenues in 2008 however this will not slow our expansion in the third quarter we will be opening a new branch in neuch tel and we are continuing to recruit and develop well trained junior employees to become consultants and wealth managers as soon as stock markets bottom out our business is set to benefit from volume effects and our broader range of services

6325916 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6325917 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6325918 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6325919 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6325920 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6325921 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6325922 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6325923 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6325924 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6325925 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6325926 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6325927 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6325928 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6325929 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6325930 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6325931 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6325932 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6325933 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6325934 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6325935 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6325936 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6325937 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6325938 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6325939 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6325940 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6325941 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6325942 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6325943 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6325944 love agape the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and greatest commandment and the second love your neighbor as yourself all the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments
6325945 remember man that thou art dust and unto dust thou shall return
6325946 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6325947 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6325948 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6325949 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6325950 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6325951 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6325955 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6325956 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6325957 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6325958 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6325959 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6325960 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6325961 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6325962 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6325963 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6325964 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6325965 mira cari o marc me ha dado el ltimo abrazo

6325971 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6325972 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6325973 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6325974 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6325975 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6325976 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6325977 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6325978 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6325979 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6325980 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6325981 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6325982 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6325983 who are open to doing something on the production side
6325984 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6325985 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6325986 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6325987 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6325988 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6325989 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6325990 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6325991 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6325992 no tiene caso que vengamos todos los d as si vamos a entrenar as mejor colgamos un pizarr n como en el panbol para anunciar el d a y la hora del partido nos reunimos 15 minutos antes y nos evitamos estar viniendo a lo pendejo

6325995 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6325996 the major advantage is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6325997 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6325998 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6325999 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6326000 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavour
6326001 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavour of the resulting oils
6326002 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6326003 isolated just one milligram a very tiny amount from natural sources that were very difficult to grow
6326004 we needed to develop a concise and efficient synthetic route to make enough largazole for animal studies
6326005 my labs next task was finding the origin of largazoles biological activity
6326006 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6326007 it s a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6326008 a developing foetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems

6326010 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6326011 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6326012 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6326013 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6326014 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6326015 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6326016 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6326017 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6326018 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6326019 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6326020 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6326021 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6326022 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6326023 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6326024 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6326025 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6326026 trucks have drinking water food material and tents infact we have tried to include everything that was asked for by the victims

6326036 the government does need to focus on what it is going to do to stop these militants and weve had that conversation very recently when the pakistani prime minister was in washington to meet with president bush
6326037 we all have an interest in fighting terrorism and the militants because the militants are not just after the united states or afghanistan these are the people who after all assassinated benazir bhutto these are the people who have launched attacks throughout pakistan
6326038 we didnt always agree with mr musharraf for instance we didnt agree with the state of emergency several months ago but president musharraf served well as an ally in the war on terror

6326042 this is what southern california looked like 100 years ago
6326043 there have been so many changes to this area but this place has stayed the same
6326044 a gravel mine of this magnitude is a massive change to the ecosystem
6326045 this is the only linkage between the coast and the mountains and you would suddenly have a 1 000 foot quarry in the middle of it
6326046 we dont have enough properties like this in the world to sacrifice for this kind of thing
6326047 nobody in their right mind wants a rock quarry in their backyard
6326048 there is no benefit to us facts dont matter statistics dont matter go to any of these houses and ask them and theyll tell you nobody wants a rock quarry in their town
6326049 the rattle in my sons chest has stopped a quarry would mean a big increase in pollution
6326050 if the wind blows over 25 mph the quarry would shut down thats the law
6326051 the perception problem is hard to get past people want to believe that this is a natural disaster and it isnt
6326052 we need the business we need the jobs and thats a positive especially when you have a company that wants to work with you
6326053 i am hopeful that all the other issues can be mitigated
6326054 if people keep saying no no no to everything what are we going to do when we need new parks and schools
6326055 but its a challenging environment and it wont be easy
6326056 but the noise levels would not exceed a significant threshold and would not impact the reserve
6326057 this is a one of a kind piece of property
6326058 is this the only place in southern california where they can extract rock they arent mining diamonds its gravel
6326059 would be like putting a rock concert next to a monastery
6326060 the accident investigation team is preparing its final report and the public can expect something in the near future

6326063 this new index is designed to eliminate price manipulation by traders and keep the project owner updated about the prices of all building materials to avert any possible dispute with the contractor
6326064 therefore it will contribute to exposing manipulators in this vital sector in the light of the sharp increases in construction materials due to the economic boom in abu dhabi in particular and the uae in general the rise in fuel prices and global transport costs have also contributed to further increases in the prices of such products we hope this index will provide all landlords and project owners with accurate estimates of the costs of their enterprises and consequently reduce the risk of disputes with contractors
6326065 we urge all those who bought cement at higher prices to supply the ministry with bill supporting their claim or contact us at the new hotline
6326066 inflation in the uae has reached alarming levels as a result of high fuel and food prices a surge in rents and construction costs and strong domestic demand due to the booming economy the chamber said in a recent report
6326067 the inflation phenomenon has become one of the most debated issues in the uae because of accelerating rates inflation has steadily risen over the past three years to reach an alarming level in 2007
6326068 one of the root causes of this problem is the wave of hikes in petrol and diesel prices in the country as such increases have led to higher construction costs slashed the profit margin of the contractors and prompted house owners to raise rents sharply
6326069 another key factor is the continued rise in the prices of both the imported and locally made building materials although the surge in rents was a major contributor to inflation in the uae the fuel price increases should not be ignored as they play a key part in pushing up rents to such an alarming level given their direct impact on various economic sectors including construction and transport
6326070 i would confirm that silt laden water from the quarry is regularly flowing into one of vartry reservoirs feeder streams
6326071 the pollution seems to occur with every wet spell clearly indicating that the measures to contain contaminated water in the quarry are inadequate i would ask that you investigate this as a matter of urgency
6326072 we dont think theres any threat but its just not best practice we would have long term concerns and we have at different times flagged the issue its a matter of treating the surface water and putting in place reed beds to clean the water
6326073 women have strengths that amaze they carry children they carry hardships they carry burdens yet they hold faith happiness love and joy
6326074 we are pleased with the companys second quarter earnings international sales continue to be strong accounting for 33 5 of the second quarter volume gross margin for the quarter declined from 26 0 for the second quarter of 2007 to 23 9 for the second quarter of 2008 rapid increases in the costs of steel and components were the primary reasons for the decline in gross margin year to date gross margin for 2008 has only declined 1 1 compared to the first half of 2007 we anticipate that inflation will continue to be a challenge during the second half of 2008 some of our subsidiaries have implemented two price increases this year and are reviewing the need for additional increases to maintain or improve gross margins we will continue our other initiatives to deal with inflation we look forward to the second half of 2008 with a backlog at june 30 2008 of 264 6 million compared to 263 0 million at march 31 2008 some of the deliveries in the backlog extend beyond the third quarter of 2008 the cost of oil and asphalt continues to cause states to increase the percentage of recycled materials used for highway paving asphalt equipment sales have improved and should continue to benefit from recycle related equipment sales

6326085 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable
6326086 it really is a case of hidden nature revealing itself to the world after remaining in splendid isolation for so long and demonstrates how important our built structures can be for wildlife discoveries like this are rare and its a chance for us to celebrate the amazing nature of wildlife
6326087 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk accidentally it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife as it has taken one hundred years to get from the balustrade to the house so we

6326090 youre still the same person so you want to do the same things youve done before
6326091 its to come from an accident and say i can still do it if i work hard i think thats the most important thing to believe in yourself to set goals and to never give up
6326092 i had a couple of people who have said to me that it would never be possible
6326093 it was actually right after i had been in the hospital and had my amputation but a dream is about what you set for yourself and not what other people set for you

6326235 in finding out truth of the paper tiger event our renrou search engine played an important role
6326236 those who mistreated the vulnerable are likely to incur the hatred of netizens
6326237 netizens could blame him but exposing his personal information is not right after all he is not really a bad person and most if not all of the netizens didnt really know what happened between the couple
6326238 for instance we see many disloyal husbands and adultery happens every day wang feis case gave us an occasion to attack those immoral
6326239 i am sure that many of the attackers of wang fei are his colleagues or even friends who have access to wangs personal information
6326240 netizens should be cautious online especially when registering dont give out your personal information
6326241 take wang feis case you cant decide who played a more important role in ferreting out his information in fact every netizen contributed to the result as for the girl condemning the earthquake victims her behavior deviated from social ethics and she would be accused anyway
6326242 currently we have no legislation protecting peoples privacy in china
6326243 on the other hand chinese netizens are not mature enough to control their own online behavior
6326244 in chinese we say more helpers make the job easier more people could help resolve the conundrum that no single person could handle
6326245 actually renrou search reflects development of society and the popularization of the internet
6326246 we started recruiting talents and rewarding them with virtual currency in may
6326247 it is our honor to help others seek happiness and our shame to leak out their privacy
6326248 a virtualized support services group is better able to handle peaks in demand because personnel from many different locations can be virtually deployed to address the concerns

6326290 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6326291 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6326292 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6326293 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6326294 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6326295 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6326296 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment

6326301 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people

6326322 dont you understand that they only wanted to see your underwear
6326323 i totally showed them today i didnt even wear underwear
6326324 this fellow certainly has a lot to say for himself
6326325 i said i had read the flap to get a working knowledge
6326326 these books are fucking lame poetry youre going to read poetry oh can you read us some poetry as we drive along
6326327 i guess she wants to catch up on her reading

6326330 we were just plopped onto earth to merely exist for a few paltry years before dying and never ever existing again
6326331 sleeping with the enemy aware that he was smothering every last part of me
6326332 i dont have words to really express what it feels like right now
6326333 they also have to feel how bad this feels to get beat on you gotta have some payback somewhere down the line
6326334 as far as the young guys go regardless of whats going on somehow we have to win some freaking ballgames and let them know thats the right way to do it
6326335 play winning baseball not good baseball winning baseball theres a difference playing to win not playing to compete im not saying that were just playing to compete right now were not getting it done period
6326336 i know everyone is giving their best effort thats for sure does that make it easier no you certainly see guys working hard and giving their best effort its just that more is required
6326337 i feel bad for the players their wives who watch their husbands struggle when things like this happen it has an effect on a lot of people not just the team manager and coaches
6326338 it seemed like no matter what i threw up there they were covering it with their barrel
6326339 pretty much everyone knows that growing up in a household where the dad is a professional baseball player the last thing you talk about is baseball so you understand history but you dont dwell on it because the father and son relationship is more important than the numbers
6326340 its weird ive watched sammy throughout the years tying him its ok i guess
6326341 but im just sensing from what im hearing hes not as encouraged by his previous outing throwing on the side as he was in his others hes not feeling painful but hes not progressing the way he was in his first couple
6326342 kind of mixed pretty good but its a work in progress
6326343 i always just liked stuff like that and my mom works in a hospital as a lab technician and ive always liked working with kids
6326344 they come and see me every once in a while and i go out and see them have dinner every once in a while they live in centralia now
6326345 201 i used to go a lot but i havent gone as much lately i may go tonight though
6326346 weve gone extremely hard you can tell doing this as long as most of us have done it when its time to let up a little bit when your fast guys are not looking as fast
6326347 i told our members that its just another tool that we can use to get the play right not to look at it as a negative but a positive
6326348 as hard as you try as much as you hustle sometimes with just the landscape of the ballparks nowadays its hard to tell so if we can get it right you know what lets use it as a tool to get it right
6326349 definitely not the most authentic japanese restaurant in the bay area

6326351 this a place i have been visting for the better part of 20 years or so
6326352 you have to take your hat off in here its not polite because this place is

6326357 how can you stay outside theres a beautiful mess inside
6326358 we felt like warriors out there the pressure of playing china made it pretty intense
6326359 ever since the ball dropped in athens weve wanted to repeat as olympic champions
6326360 gymnastics has meant so much to me im going to be busy but id love to keep going
6326361 if there is anything i can do to make you stay let me know
6326362 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis

6326367 its been four weeks on this trip and its so demanding instead of being a coach with them two three hours a day youre a parent being with them 24 hours a day that was more than i could imagine
6326368 next time we take the field only two u s teams are left that in itself is saying a lot
6326369 it would be different mentally if he were a rookie but hes familiar with the offense from his participation in the offseason program
6326370 were glad hes coming in and we look forward to him being a ram for a long time and getting a deal done
6326371 when hes been able to practice and move around hes looked awfully good to me
6326372 we really have one practice day before the raiders game
6326373 first time that i can remember it was like that
6326374 were going to kind of try and force feed that just a little bit
6326375 we argue because she thinks you 22 and i think you 26 how old you are
6326376 seeing those guys hurt like that it really killed all of us
6326377 the seniors sat down and talked to us and said youve got to bounce back from this this is kind of like the redemption year for us we have a new coach and everything is new this year
6326378 such a strong personality and forceful important person in a lot of peoples lives
6326379 i want them to use those memories to be strong to be successful
6326380 they need to know themselves and how the memory of coach ennis can motivate them remember what it means to get ready for a game and to have your best game
6326381 its like coach ennis said if you can run block and tackle you can be a great team
6326382 were going to take it a day at a time and just see how he feels
6326383 when a guy has played as long as hes played or some other quarterbacks around the league have played youre not quite as concerned with your minutes in the preseason
6326384 theres definitely a comfort level for me out there at right tackle
6326385 of all the guys up front the other night he was as consistent as anyone we had
6326386 with offensive line coach mike solari hes somebody who teaches me something new every day about technique about hand placement things of that nature
6326387 we are exploring all of our options but our best option may be to do nothing
6326388 we have a strong feeling about what were up against weve been without lauren the past six weeks its not like were headed into uncharted waters
6326389 she feels so much loyalty and responsibility toward her teammates but ultimately this is about her health shes disappointed but the doctors told her its a good decision to have the surgery
6326390 were looking for a good player that can come in and help us
6326391 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6326392 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6326393 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6326394 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6326395 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6326396 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6326397 i tell you my story so that you might save me
6326398 coho fishing is starting to pick up at sekiu and tuesday our sampler there checked 11 boats with 20 hatchery marked coho so it looks like theyre showing up and maybe this rain will get more to move in
6326399 the port angeles area has been pretty much dead for coho
6326400 were seeing some resident coho caught at edmonds point no point and meadow point but places from mukilteo to the shipwreck havent produced anything
6326401 it was pretty slow on sunday and then got better on monday 34 boats with 17 chinook and four coho
6326402 i fished monday night and we boated a 25 pound king in front of todds shipyard
6326403 at neah bay we saw more angler effort and catches were just over a fish per person and it was almost all coho
6326404 that puts them up against their coho quota so well be watching that pretty closely this week once the ocean quota is reached theyll immediately open up the inside area 4b coho fishery
6326405 we saw some pretty decent catches this past week but not as high as weve been seeing
6326406 on the private boats the catches have been five to six tuna per person
6326407 i had guys doing pretty good on perch and theyre getting a lot of them off the docks in lake washington
6326408 the cutthroat fishing in lake washington is also pretty good and so is the bass fishing in lake washington and lake sammamish
6326409 i have this place programmed on my cell phone and it always takes 10 minutes for the order to be ready and the food is so delicious
6326410 a cute little store packed with everything for your pets
6326411 oh you want poodle feet thats not on the card
6326412 yes i want him to have a puppy cut with a mohawk

6326418 que se felicitaba por encontrarse al lado del vencedor de la batalla de caseros diez y ocho a os despu s del gran d a en el que le hab a cabido el honor junto a mitre de derrotar al tirano de las libertades argentinas y establecer el reinado de la libertad y la tolerancia que si disidencias locales los hab a separado al d a siguiente de la victoria tomando caminos distintos para llegar al venturoso porvenir que todos aspiraban el patriotismo noble y puro los hab a reunido de nuevo para trabajar juntos por la felicidad de la rep blica sin recordar para nada las antiguas disidencias de partido
6326419 siamo stati un po ingenui nel valutare lopposizione sia politica sia popolare che avremmo dovuto affrontare
6326420 avremmo dovuto informarci meglio sulla cultura locale ma stiamo facendo dei progressi
6326421 chiunque grazie alla sua posizione e alle sue potenzialit possa fare qualcosa dovrebbe aderire alliniziativa scoprir che questa pu essere molto gratificante e che ne vale la pena fino allultimo centesimo
6326422 chi questa gente devono essere venuti per portarci via la nostra terra
6326423 consistent with our position last year naral does not oppose passage of the born alive infants protection act floor debate served to clarify the bills intent and assure us that it is not targeted at roe v wade or a womans right to choose
6326424 i brought pictures in and presented them to the committee of very premature babies from my neonatal resuscitation book from the american pediatric association trying to show them unwanted babies were being cast aside babies the same age were being treated if they were wanted
6326425 doctors really dont care about children who are being born with a reasonable prospect of life because they are so locked into their pro abortion views that they would watch an infant that is viable die
6326426 that may be your assessment and i dont see any evidence of that what we are doing here is to create one more burden on a woman and i cant support that
6326427 i just played my game and got into my rhythm ill just take one fight at a time
6326428 the game has changed and the way the game is played has to be changed
6326429 dont worry about anything just run like its your last race
6326430 the pace was slow and i didnt want it to happen like it happened in the 1 500 im happy i won it wasnt necessary to win but i decided why not go for it
6326431 i felt good ive had a few problems with my left achilles after the trials
6326432 that is why i lost a few weeks of training that could be the result of me not making the finals in the 1 500
6326433 hemos tenido muchas inundaciones en vecindarios aislados gente que tiene desde 15 cent metros hasta 1 2 metros de agua en sus hogares
6326434 tenemos algo menos de 1 000 hogares afectados por las inundaciones
6326435 hemos debido rescatar a la gente en botes y embarcaciones de propulsadas por h lices
6326436 eww thats so nasty come on i have really good taste
6326437 because of this new government the economy is out of control everything has become so expensive
6326438 musharraf put the army into the flour mills to control prices but with this government everything is out of control
6326439 it is very difficult to manage because inflation is so high
6326440 what people want from the government is relief for the poor
6326441 your little ipod is loaded down with hoobastank dont be a tape player hater girl were groovin to hank
6326442 got sweet apple pie on the stove the birds are all flying low
6326443 hes got to get to 26 27 28 before he reaches his proverbial prime
6326444 hes still a baby and as he gets stronger yeah it gets scary to think about what he might do but we just all want to be there to watch it its a beautiful thing
6326445 hes raised the bar for us usain bolt is the fastest man ive ever seen in my life he put on a show tonight
6326446 his stride i mean its poetry in motion hes not like a beast running hes like a gazelle
6326447 those long strides man he takes one and i take 2
6326448 i have to run 2 times as fast i took a hell of a butt whoopin from him
6326449 youre back there giving everything you got and its brutal hes doing it and making it look so easy michael johnson never made it look that easy
6326450 i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6326451 we always say that if youve got style you better back it up
6326452 well he backed it up then you see him having such a good time and i think thats something our sport dearly needs
6326453 to be honest with you i think it was retaliatory for the lawsuits that were started against animal control 5 years ago
6326454 i know it was portrayed that it was a very messy situation i do not rebut that i did have too many i had two people living with me at the house and it was manageable once they left it was too much for one person but i was trying my best
6326455 it was a lot for one person to take care of once my volunteers left
6326456 the cement industry is feeling the impact of the rapid increase in the price of thermal and electrical power sources very directly
6326457 her walls are mediterranean blue her baby sister picked the hue
6326458 whilst benefiting from strong commodity prices we managed to contain costs across our operations
6326459 some people are panicking but the numbers arent that bad
6326460 there are things that are way worse than anyone thought
6326461 despite all of that things are kind of holding together its actually not as bad as some people think
6326462 occidental has weathered these ups and downs and so does our state
6326463 they know the imperative of being flexible and not hunkering down but looking for opportunities even in challenging times
6326464 we were also expecting those double digit losses would taper off but were not seeing the signs of that yet
6326465 we dont know yet whether thats going to continue through the fall i wouldnt call it a rough spot id call it a pretty bad spot in the visitor industry
6326466 the basic problem is theres a huge amount of uncertainty about the u s economy the japanese economy the european economy the hawaii economy
6326467 i really believe that over the longer term that people will not give up traveling and vacationing
6326468 its definitely a moving target and hopefully oil prices will continue to go down and well all be a little happier
6326469 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency
6326470 a backup system isnt designed to be a 100 percent complete inventory of all e mails
6326471 its designed to make a copy of data at a specific point in time
6326472 data is backed up on a daily weekly and monthly basis as part of a disaster recovery strategy to ensure to protect the organization from data loss
6326473 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly ten i can only take you so seriously
6326474 contractors cannot accurately plan for or staff based on such an estimate
6326475 we will continue to work with members of congress and the national archives and will communicate the results of our accounting effort at an appropriate time
6326476 the white house that wants to keep track of all your e mail and phone records cant even keep track of their own
6326477 i believe in an america where the separation of church and state is absolute where no catholic prelate would tell the president should he be a catholic how to act and no protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote
6326478 break down the barriers and remind people about our heritage and our responsibility to be active citizens
6326479 i dont think this is an encouragement to engage in any illegal action
6326480 i think its more of the nature of a political statement we think it should be legalized
6326481 we exclude promotion of hard liquor and cigarettes because although these products are legal there is precedent that these products cannot be promoted to minors and of course our buses are viewable by minors
6326482 we also do not post content deemed obscene defamatory profane or sexual nor content that incites a breach of the peace such as epithets based on race religion color or gender
6326483 political and issue oriented messages on public buses is considered part of first amendment right to freedom of speech
6326484 to disallow or censor such postings would be in opposition to the law
6326485 confirma los peores temores que pod amos tener sobre la rusia de putin
6326486 the contradictory religion of environmentalism has given people a purpose in life and despite ignoring all the contrary science this religion provides some of the stitches that hold the fabric of society together the laboratory for religious life and practice is experience religion is not about pie in the sky when we die it is about the present religion tries to make sense of whats happening to us now and gives us the mechanisms whereby we can have hope for a meaningful life in spite its disappointments religion gives us the mechanism to cope with failure environmentalism cannot provide for these needs
6326487 old guy who sits in the front row of church

6326493 obviously i favor senator obamas energy positions and democrats have been by and large the more forward leaning actors
6326494 but john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change
6326495 im very encouraged about where the presidential rhetoric is in this campaign

6326502 the international olympic committee themselves recognise that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
6326503 its a mistake to think that games model themselves on previous games every games ive been to has been very different
6326504 but we can be creative we know that more people will probably come to london for the games than to other cities
6326505 the days of just leaving 90 000 seater stadia particularly in london where youd have two with wembley are over
6326506 you have to provide something for local communities to do more than simply press their noses up against
6326507 no implica abdicar de mi amor a la iglesia ni de mi estima al servicio ministerial y a la vida religiosa
6326508 a ser fiel a la fe cat lica en la que fue bautizado y a llevar una vida coherente con el evangelio
6326509 es propio de la estructura fundamental del cristianismo la distinci n entre lo que es del c sar y lo que es de dios cf mt 22 21 esto es entre estado e iglesia la construcci n de un orden social y estatal justo es una tarea fundamental que debe afrontar de nuevo cada generaci n trat ndose de un quehacer pol tico esto no puede ser un cometido inmediato de la iglesia la iglesia no puede ni debe emprender por cuenta propia la empresa pol tica de realizar la sociedad m s justa posible no puede ni debe sustituir al estado pero tampoco puede ni debe quedarse al margen en la lucha por la justicia debe insertarse en ella a trav s de la argumentaci n racional y debe despertar las fuerzas espirituales sin las cuales la justicia que siempre exige tambi n renuncias no puede afirmarse ni prosperar la sociedad justa no puede ser obra de la iglesia sino de la pol tica no obstante le interesa sobremanera trabajar por la justicia esforz ndose por abrir la inteligencia y la voluntad a las exigencias del bien el establecimiento de estructuras justas no es un cometido inmediato de la iglesia sino que pertenece a la esfera de la pol tica es decir de la raz n auto responsable el deber inmediato de actuar en favor de un orden justo en la sociedad es m s bien propio de los fieles laicos como ciudadanos del estado est n llamados a participar en primera persona en la vida p blica

6326511 we need to ensure that every 90 days or so we have new things coming to the aquarium
6326512 you have to constantly upgrade and bring in new and interesting animals they are a critical component to our growth
6326513 but if there is a place that can do it its the georgia aquarium
6326514 no business can exist on creating new customers all the time
6326515 people are much more likely to join if it is a changing dynamic institution rather than a static institution
6326516 the challenge for any organization today is to stay relevant
6326517 when an institution is brand new a whole lot of people will come in to see it thats easy but what happens when theyve all visited
6326518 i cant take the risk of that trend going to 1 9 million or 1 8 million
6326519 youve got to change the basic strategy of how youre working
6326520 these guys made very significant contributions to the aquarium but they have decided to move on
6326521 the organization was not prepared to make changes for the downturn in attendance
6326522 we did so well the first year that people didnt react with urgency because they didnt have the time
6326523 if the senior leadership doesnt buy into that strategy you have to change
6326524 we have an incredibly successful era under stuart and there is a little bit of a similarity there
6326525 i think we are hopefully making the right steps to get back to where we were when he was coaching
6326526 i think freddie has taken stuarts coaching on board and freddie has got his own style as well
6326527 it is a bit of a contrast in styles there but certainly both of them have got the same principles and the same work ethic as well so theres a lot of similarities there
6326528 every time you play a team coached by ricky stuart you know you are in for a tough game and certainly thats the way they play their football
6326529 i dont think theyve had a game where they havent turned up to play this year and thats the way the teams he coaches prepare and thats the way youve got to prepare if you want to be able to hold them
6326530 all of us want to cement a top four spot with a three point buffer ahead of brisbane
6326531 its important in that respect but we certainly feel it is two different competitions
6326532 youve just got to get into the semis and then a whole new competition starts again
6326533 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6326534 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6326535 met de huidige vloot zitten we ook in de tweede helft van dit jaar op de toppen van de markt
6326536 we dont wont to be alarmist if you are careful and keep a good look all should be well
6326537 the colossal species has a reputation for being an aggressive and dangerous predator and have been feared and misrepresented in the past
6326538 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
6326539 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6326540 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6326541 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
6326542 they should put their eyes out so they cant commit any more crimes
6326543 prison isnt a solution anymore they just form their own gangs inside prison and come out stronger
6326544 a spider web of corruption has penetrated many parts of our department
6326545 the town was very angry the truth is they wanted to beat me too
6326546 now operate in drug trafficking kidnapping and money laundering among other things with no central control nor any one gang dominating in any of the criminal activities that is why kidnapping has grown more competitive with kidnappers using much more violence against each other and against the victims in a bid to gain territory markets or dominance

6326549 we have been informed by the hong kong authorities that mr gadd was denied entry to hong kong and has returned to bangkok
6326550 mr gadd was in contact with us seeking consular assistance
6326551 he must definitely be coming back to bangkok since hong kong refused to let him in
6326552 we will have to expel him either back to vietnam or britain or another country where he wants to go
6326553 i dont know his arrival time or flight number but i think he will land mid afternoon because his name was not on any of the passenger lists this morning
6326554 england is my home its where my heart is and family are i cant wait to see them god bless them all

6326557 its important to keep in mind that the small percentage of uninsured are still covered for their insured amounts and half of their uninsured money as assets of indymac are sold they may receive even more
6326558 all bank depositors should also understand that they can have insurance coverage in excess of the basic limits of 100 000 per institution with an additional 250 000 per institution for iras for instance subject to certain conditions single and joint accounts are separately insured and revocable trusts generally provide 100 000 of coverage per beneficiary

6326560 i think george needs to be at atascadero state hospital i think he needs psychotropic medications to get rid of the voices so hes not distracted so we can make him competent obviously the jury did not feel the same way i do

6326562 our mission is just to observe and be sure he has a fair trial

6326568 we all know what were capable of its just a matter of whether we want to play that way
6326569 weve made a few excuses for ourselves because weve been missing players but at the end of the day we didnt have the right attitude last week
6326570 weve got all our players back now so there cant be any excuses this week
6326571 we all knew after the game on friday night against the dragons that our attitude wasnt there
6326572 time will tell whether everyones changed their attitude but theres been a bit of soul searching this week
6326573 we need to win our remaining three games and win them with some sore of authority

6326580 im sure the broncos will be targeting me a little in defence but thats to be expected

6326602 we have an understanding that he bennett has a job to do and i have a job to do and personal feelings about each other dont come into it
6326603 once wayne signed with st george he always had to plan for st george
6326604 id hate to think though that his main focus wasnt on making sure that the side was playing well and in good form
6326605 this year is still our main focus and weve both still got a job to do
6326606 we wouldnt be doing the right thing by the players if that wasnt the case
6326607 wayne bennett obviously has things he has to plan with st george and were doing the same for the brisbane broncos
6326608 its a difficult situation but darius has made his decision we know about it now and we have to move on
6326609 if anyone wants to doubt israels signing here they just need to go and look at a few of his games and what he can do
6326610 hes young and hes a wonderful player and hes got a long long career ahead of him
6326611 we needed that area of our game fixed up and he can certainly fill the void for us
6326612 we have lost some good players but weve also signed some good players and we think weve got a couple of good young players in our under 20s who can come through next year which well find out in the next few months
6326613 we all know what were capable of its just a matter of whether we want to play that way
6326614 weve made a few excuses for ourselves because weve been missing players but at the end of the day we didnt have the right attitude last week

6326630 how is it possible that officials didnt know there had been a technical mistake
6326631 the us have the right to protest but why when officials disqualified spearmon did they not notice churandys violation
6326632 i dont understand it if i stood on the line then why did the jury not disqualify me at the same time as spearmon it was at least 90 minutes before they told me i was disqualified
6326633 we recognise that the race footage indicates a technical mistake we will examine however whether the rules make it possible to disqualify an athlete in this way
6326634 its a pity for a big country like the united states to make such a small statement
6326635 as we were studying the video for wallace it was brought to our attention that there may have been a violation in lane 6 we saw the violation and appealed that result we then went through the rules process we wanted to make sure that the results of the race were fair

6326664 theyve gone out and announced theyre going to set the benchmark so theyre the ones putting pressure on themselves
6326665 theyre probably capable of backing it up because theyve recruited possibly the best out of the whole league with the quality and experience theyve bought
6326666 but i just hope they put their best team out against us so we can look to exploit any of the weaknesses theyve got left in them if there are any
6326667 if i cop a bit of niggle theyre probably going to get a bit back but theres no hard feelings its just all part of the game and im looking forward to playing against a very good friend of mine like iain fyfe and the other guys that are still there from when i was there
6326668 if only you could it would mean a lot to me if i can score against them again youll see in my celebration just how much
6326669 even without an individualized explanation of how the provision would affect their benefits notice of the provision could have induced the employees to increase savings in other retirement vehicles or to consider other employment
6326670 that means that the old pre conversion plan remains in effect which would be the best thing possible for the older employees
6326671 we look forward to showing the court our side of this argument
6326672 and it allows companies to provide transition benefits to employees which is the most generous thing an employer can do in a conversion

6326742 how is it possible that officials didnt know there had been a technical mistake
6326743 the us have the right to protest but why when officials disqualified spearmon did they not notice churandys violation
6326744 i dont understand it if i stood on the line then why did the jury not disqualify me at the same time as spearmon it was at least 90 minutes before they told me i was disqualified
6326745 we recognise that the race footage indicates a technical mistake we will examine however whether the rules make it possible to disqualify an athlete in this way
6326746 its a pity for a big country like the united states to make such a small statement
6326747 as we were studying the video for wallace it was brought to our attention that there may have been a violation in lane 6 we saw the violation and appealed that result we then went through the rules process we wanted to make sure that the results of the race were fair

6326749 theyve gone out and announced theyre going to set the benchmark so theyre the ones putting pressure on themselves
6326750 theyre probably capable of backing it up because theyve recruited possibly the best out of the whole league with the quality and experience theyve bought
6326751 but i just hope they put their best team out against us so we can look to exploit any of the weaknesses theyve got left in them if there are any
6326752 if i cop a bit of niggle theyre probably going to get a bit back but theres no hard feelings its just all part of the game and im looking forward to playing against a very good friend of mine like iain fyfe and the other guys that are still there from when i was there
6326753 if only you could it would mean a lot to me if i can score against them again youll see in my celebration just how much
6326754 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6326755 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6326756 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6326757 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6326758 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6326759 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6326760 he was scared of the narco test and was insistent that he shouldnt be made to go through it
6326761 i have never been affiliated with any intelligence agency of any nation in any capacity

6326770 ik vind het onrechtvaardig wraakroepend ik heb niets fout gedaan soms voel ik haat heb ik zin om te roepen naar politici dat ze zich vergissen dat het onrechtvaardig is
6326771 hier niet lang meer kan blijven omdat het te zwaar is
6326772 ik zal het niet aankunnen mijn leven is hier ik heb ginder niets het is een andere wereld niet meer de mijne ik heb mijn weg hier gevonden dit is fout ondraaglijk
6326773 i suppose you have a point antoine but does it really matter now
6326774 are you suggesting she used me to have her father and brothers punished
6326775 i believe she trusts you enough to know what to do with her information
6326776 even if she doesnt want you to confide her information to anyone antoine all i really need is a simple yes or no
6326777 if she becomes angry with us i will speak to her myself i will show her why it needs to be done
6326778 i will have to know antoine i will have to talk to your father since clarissa didnt give his name
6326779 i hope that you will not tell mother or father about my invitation to clarissa morris
6326780 i stopped her before she would chatter me to death
6326781 could you send him up here before we have dinner
6326782 i dont know antoine what with you being such a wicked and dangerous gunfighter and everything he might
6326783 but i want to know if you kissed dear clarissa
6326784 i cut him off with a flick of my hand
6326785 i hope dear boy that you arent planning some adventure again
6326786 henri waited for me to continue his hazel eyes reflecting the light from the flickering lamps
6326787 its the dead of winter antoine and youre in no condition to travel
6326788 no not now henri later when the weather clears when my injury has healed
6326789 id love to go with you antoine you know that
6326790 that is why i wanted to ask you in private my family cannot know
6326791 i want you to go with me to the lagrange place
6326792 but you must you must promise never to talk about our plans or talk about being there not to anyone
6326793 of course antoine you have my word as a friend and a gentleman
6326794 i wont tell you a thing henri so please dont go on about it
6326795 it has been no secret to me this girls infatuation with you
6326796 how do you know so much for someone your age
6326797 tsk tsk i wish i had your magnetic charm my boy i would be able to court any princess in the world with your mastery of feminine affections come to think of it i wouldnt need to do any courting i would just whistle
6326798 he is sleeping now antoine his wound will take a long time to heal
6326799 its just that some of the girls at school thinks she puts on airs antoine thats all
6326800 it means that albert morris along with his two sons charles and drake are under arrest for murder and attempted murder
6326801 clarissa told me after our lunch that they plotted to kill father to kill me
6326802 along with albert they set up father to be ambushed
6326803 charles and drake have confessed to this charge of attempted murder against your father i didnt bring charges on your behalf antoine
6326804 i expect he will hang for it if the trial succeeds
6326805 do you mean antoine my husband will have to testify
6326806 that is not for me to decide madame i have already sent a rider to lonniston where the trial will be held my man will get the warrants against albert and his sons from the judge there we will probably have to move the suspected parties there in the next few days

6326822 he had no insurance and was riding around in a private vehicle with the logo of a pizza place on top of the vehicle
6326823 not a very good track record especially at an expensive hospital like that

6326827 they would check on alex through the course of the night
6326828 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6326829 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6326830 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6326831 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now
6326832 i cant rest i understand some of it i dont like people begging me if youre not bothering nobody why do you have to move where do you want me to go
6326833 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6326834 honestly i dont see how this has much to do with your election
6326835 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that
6326836 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6326837 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product
6326838 you put a chinese casket next to a york casket or one of these other manufacturers you cant tell the difference

6326841 libelous containing many misstatements of fact and stating conclusions that are meant to do nothing but maliciously harm crowder funeral homes
6326842 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
6326843 its not the job of the government to define who is rich
6326844 raise taxes on your income your electric bills even your life savings
6326845 the real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets it gets to the heart of their economic philosophies
6326846 both tax plans take for granted a big peace dividend from ending the war in iraq
6326847 been law for eight years now and taxpayers are used to those rates
6326848 allowing them to expire would be tantamount to a massive tax increase
6326849 youre no longer forced to be isolated from whats going on in your office with your clients or with friends or family for business travelers this will greatly aid productivity and for leisure travelers it means they will be in control of their entertainment
6326850 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6326851 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6326852 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6326853 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6326854 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now
6326855 it was the closest thing to hell that i have seen
6326856 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6326857 this will give the housing industry a real life demonstration of the potential of a financial institution
6326858 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6326859 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of cornflakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6326860 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6326861 thats going to have some serious consequence at the retail level
6326862 the only thing left is for prices to go up
6326863 the only question is is the finished product when it comes to market substantially similar to the original drawing
6326864 you have to judge this not from the standpoint of a professional doll sculptor but from the standpoint of a child thats the law
6326865 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6326866 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete
6326867 can you see a parent saying to their child why do you want that you have a substantially similar doll back home
6326868 something else is going on besides mattels property in contributing to sales
6326869 in history there have only been two successful fashion dolls barbie and bratz and mr larian and mr bryant stole one of those
6326870 the numbers are what they are and the law says when you profit by taking someone elses confidential information you have to give it back
6326871 we talk about the internet bringing things to you but the current internet is so limited
6326872 its so slow its so click based its a tiny little keyhole that youre looking at the world through and this is like a picture window
6326873 if were successful with this weve actually invented a new media type thats halfway between photos computer games and video
6326874 were just at the beginning of how to use this
6326875 it took a day and a half on a big cluster of computers to calculate those synths
6326876 its very much like walking through the front door of a home for the first time and fully experiencing every element of design and architecture
6326877 we get this great sort of trellis of the worlds places
6326878 without a doubt this special review will uncover what we already know that the eclipse 500 marks the safest new airplane introduction into service in 20 years
6326879 but putting things on the skin puts them straight into your blood stream
6326880 try to use products that are as plain as possible
6326881 the fewer ingredients the better and dont trust the labeling claims
6326882 were approaching retirement in the next six to seven years
6326883 if theres not enough faculty not enough courses we have a de facto enrollment cap
6326884 the school that i want to go to is a state school but its 17 000 a semester
6326885 and hopefully voters will give us a chance to improve facilities by voting in favor of a bond issue
6326886 there are still a couple of issues that were wrestling with but that 135 million figure is correct as of the end of wednesday afternoon
6326887 a key question is whether soft economic growth will create enough slack to push core inflation lower as occurred in the early 1990s
6326888 in order to ensure that any investigation of the allegations is fair and free from any question of interference or influence i am taking a leave of absence effective immediately for the duration of the investigation
6326889 i believe these steps will allow our union to continue to serve the best interests of our membership during this time
6326890 these allegations are of serious concern to all of us and we support mr freemans decision to put the best interests of the members first
6326891 let it be clear that we proudly and firmly stand with president freeman and the work of our local
6326892 we have such an incredibly strong pool of applicants and we know we have limited space in the fall we wanted to provide an opportunity for a limited number of students in the winter it helps us better manage enrollment
6326893 most people to take some time off after high school to make sure you have your priorities straight
6326894 it has become a great way to get kids willing and able to think outside the box who are willing to be flexible
6326895 some of the students may be at more risk academically and they might be more at risk socially since they are entering school at a time friendships and relationships already have been established
6326896 theres always a group of students every year we couldnt admit for space reasons in the fall but just couldnt turn away they are too much of a good fit to turn away
6326897 graduate at comparable rates and really become a part of the student body with little challenge
6326898 for some reason tuesday nights was when they thought the aliens came out then it was wednesdays
6326899 they were waiting for the aliens to abduct them and they were anxious to meet them wed just shake our heads
6326900 the timing of the conclusion of the missile defense deal is anything but accidental
6326901 now that the missile system is going forward the deal takes on much sharper overtones from the russian perspective
6326902 before the georgia invasion i was against the installation of the missile shield in poland
6326903 but now after the events there i feel threatened from the east and i dont regret the decision
6326904 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6326905 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6326906 i think it helps the administrations case by creating a backdrop where geopolitical competition from all sorts has returned
6326907 on its merit the war in georgia is irrelevant to the debate over a missile defense system that is supposed to protect us from an iranian strike but when a war is going on the hard line voices have an upper hand
6326908 det r en fr jd att vara n ra leoparder
6326909 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6326910 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6326911 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6326912 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6326913 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6326914 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6326915 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6326916 as we look back on it we see that there were just some serious failures in the management of risks
6326917 not something that lends itself to on the job training

6326919 the war doesnt affect us we were friends before and we will be friends after
6326920 there have been some who make sure we can hear them when they talk of the bad russians if someone on the street asks us where we are from we say we are armenians we think about leaving wed go to moscow more and more russians have left in the lat few years

6326925 led to leaks and drafts which was not good for health and could be a fire hazard
6326926 these chunks of concrete could fall off and injure someone without proper frames how do you lock and secure your dwelling
6326927 if i dont get fruit and vegetables for my grandchildren they will starve and die there is no way i will take my family to die in delft
6326928 i am unemployed but i get temporary work now and again and i make use of the market whenever there is nothing for my family to eat i go to epping market
6326929 a mass relocation even further away from the city will significantly disadvantage the residents
6326930 we are not against the democratic government and would love to work closely with them
6326931 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6326932 i just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody
6326933 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6326934 i perceived him at the time and wrongly judged him to be a phony here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me
6326935 going to find myself im going to write a book kids book and just try to get my life together
6326936 there are so many people out there who dislike him its safer for him to stay in jail
6326937 simson makes some decent points in the video then shows that he has no grasp of the concept that infinitely replicable digital goods differ from physical goods that must be manufactured music can be free when mercedes are free said simson

6326943 a virtualized support services group is better able to handle peaks in demand because personnel from many different locations can be virtually deployed to address the concerns
6326944 due to regulatory requirements of the prc we had to sell one of two very successful companies namely fortis haitong or abn amro teda fund management teda supported the choice for old mutual as a buyer for aateda and old mutual is committed to further developing the company hand in hand with teda given the very good relationship we enjoy with teda and the jv we are happy to have an agreement with both teda and old mutual in the best interests of all stakeholders
6326945 this is a rare opportunity to buy a sizeable stake in a well established and well managed asset management business in the region we have been impressed by the jvs management team and the achievements they have made this partnership establishes old mutuals presence in the chinese asset management market and lays the foundations for old mutual groups further expansion in asia the companys existing retail and institutional clients and partners will continue to benefit from the joint ventures growing expertise old mutual will bring high levels of innovation and product development global and emerging market fund management expertise and training which will build on the valuable progress made to date and take the joint venture to the next level in its development into an international asset manager

6326951 i think they show tremendous disparities in cancer for many american indian populations throughout the country
6326952 it really points to the fact that we need to try to engage health systems to take on cancer disparities
6326953 american indians tend to have a higher burden of many risk factors for cancer
6326954 current funding levels per capita for indian health service are about half of what the government spends on medicare funding and about half what they spend per capita on incarcerated persons in the prison system
6326955 certainly there needs to be awareness on the community level
6326956 it is a wake up call that we can be doing better and that communities should galvanize around cancer control issues
6326957 when resources are limited you tend to start prioritizing what you provide
6326958 but as funding becomes scarcer you tend to prioritize to life or death situations
6326959 the new information has great profound impacts on individual people

6327080 after watching this show people will come to realize that despite all the stories and all the rumors about me despite how well they may think they know me there is another side to dmx that they have never seen and hopefully it will make people question what they see and hear about me in the future

6327095 first of all its just more personal im involved in every aspect of the writing as far as the direction of the music its very different i wanted this album to have something that was a little bit of rock a little bit of r amp b and a little bit of pop
6327096 im a dancer and when i perform live i love to dance so i have to make sure it has that nice kicking bass the pop sound is to make it a little bit more now and when it comes to the rock it makes it very live feeling very instrumental i listen to a lot of music like classic rock alternative hip hop classical jazz whatever so im very musical and like to be able to incorporate that into my music as well

6327105 it is an important and exciting festival and the perfect place to showcase my new film the secret life of bees
6327106 using a four bit microcontroller i would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness from snow white to coal black the program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16 element table of initial timer values then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected from the table at the end of the time delay it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast come back next week and ill show you a working prototype
6327107 toasters dont just turn bread into toast they are also used to warm frozen waffles what you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker as the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated they will demand more capabilities they will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage fry bacon and make scrambled eggs a toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete if we dont look to the future we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years
6327108 with this in mind we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem first create a class of breakfast foods specialize this class into subclasses grains pork and poultry the specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast muffins pancakes and waffles pork divided into sausage links and bacon and poultry divided into scrambled eggs hard boiled eggs poached eggs fried eggs and various omelet classes
6327109 the ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork dairy and poultry classes thus we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance at run time the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says cook yourself the semantics of this message depend of course on the kind of object so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs
6327110 reviewing the process so far we see that the analysis phase has revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast food in the design phase we have discovered some derived requirements specifically we need an object oriented language with multiple inheritance of course users dont want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying so concurrent processing is required too
6327111 we must not forget the user interface the lever that lowers the food lacks versatility and the darkness knob is confusing users wont buy the product unless it has a user friendly graphical interface when the breakfast cooker is plugged in users should see a cowboy boot on the screen users click on it and the message booting unix v 8 3 appears on the screen unix 8 3 should be out by the time the product gets to the market users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook
6327112 having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase an intel 80386 with 8mb of memory a 30mb hard disk and a vga monitor should be sufficient if you select a multitasking object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a built in gui writing the program will be a snap imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware first design strategy to lock us into a four bit microcontroller
6327113 i prefer not to call it a sense of fairness but others might
6327114 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6327115 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better

6327125 his appearance fee alone just for tying on his shoe laces will be minimum us 100 000 at least and thats chicken feed compared to tiger woods wanting 2 million to 4 million to pick up his golf clubs and play
6327126 hell have an annual retainer and every time he wins a gold medal or breaks a record he might get 100 000 each time
6327127 he may well have picked up us 1 million this week by breaking two world records
6327128 the world saw a bit of it when he went to the world junior championships and now they are witnessing it on the biggest stage of all
6327129 thats how he plays with me and with his girlfriend

6327163 there will be a lot of differences with the second album
6327164 first of all its just more personal im involved in every aspect of the writing as far as the direction of the music its very different i wanted this album to have something that was a little bit of rock a little bit of r amp b and a little bit of pop
6327165 im a dancer and when i perform live i love to dance so i have to make sure it has that nice kicking bass the pop sound is to make it a little bit more now and when it comes to the rock it makes it very live feeling very instrumental i listen to a lot of music like classic rock alternative hip hop classical jazz whatever so im very musical and like to be able to incorporate that into my music as well

6327187 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6327188 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted

6327204 he asked me if what i said in the affidavit was the truth
6327205 did marcelo tell you that the firm is lopezes counsel on the case

6327208 i said a wasted life as in his life had been wasted he was a friend of my brothers too but what i am saying is that because i dont know him personally i am detached from him as a person just as i am from all the people in the middle east being killed as we speak my point was that we are detached from everyone around us those we walk past in the streets they all have their own stories their own lives people who loves them but we cant feel any of that i think you missed the point of my post it was that we need to start finding that connection again because it was a fucking scary feeling
6327209 i dont feel the same way at all i try to remind myself everyday of what is happening in places i cant see i remind myself that im not better then any other person that they all have a life that is worth just as much as mine i try to smile at everyone and i do keep in mind they theyve loved are love have hurt have lost i dunno im just saying i try not to detach myself that i am aware of the people around me or a lot more then i used to be i dont even know what it is exactly im trying to say except for that even though i didnt see the body im hugely affected and if i had seen it id probably never forget it for the rest of my life i dont even know exactly what this difference between us is not that im saying its bad im just pointing it out

6327211 in modern american culture its generally assumed that a romantic and sexual relationship will be monogamous unless you agree otherwise but another of these default assumptions i think is sex its also generally assumed that a romantic and sexual relationship will be well sexual with reasonable exceptions to be made for times of illness or great stress of course and now lets take a look at ethics and contracts because another thing thats generally understood in our society is that if one person breaks their side of an agreement the other person is under no obligation whatsoever to keep theirs i dont know enough about the law to know if this concept always holds true in legal contracts although my understanding is that it usually does but i would argue that it does hold true in the social contract if you promise to sweep the sidewalk on tuesdays if your neighbor does it on fridays and you start blowing it off you have no right to expect your neighbor to keep it up if i promise to help you move if you take me out for pizza after and i flake out on helping you move i have no right to expect pizza if you skank out on your half of a bargain you have no right to assume that the other party will stick to theirs

6327221 death race 2000 the er classic doesnt really describe it cult hit how about that
6327222 i read some blogs on it where the director writer and producer came to tucson surreptitiously to work on the script
6327223 no matter where you go in life after this it will always be better than tucson
6327224 at sundance last january i talked to the producer and co producer of hamlet 2 im also friends with basically the whole art department who worked on it
6327225 i guess they thought about filming in tucson but it all came down to money as it always does
6327226 with all the incentives new mexico offers compared to arizona it was a no brainer
6327227 hamlet 2 is a low budget film that came in under the radar
6327228 i didnt hear anything about the project until it got to sundance
6327229 arizona does have a tax incentive program too but it is more awkward to use not as film friendly as the one in new mexico
6327230 we are trying to get the state legislature to make arizonas incentives more film friendly weve been working on it for three years were preparing now to make another push in january
6327231 i was recently in the production office for st john of las vegas in albuquerque and there were several cars in the parking lot with arizona plates
6327232 if i was able to relocate i would probably give moving to new mexico some serious thought
6327233 there simply isnt enough work here and it does affect the quality of ones life
6327234 a lot of our arizona work force is over there right now working
6327235 to make hamlet 2 they spent 8 million on the movie
6327236 then the state of new mexico wrote the filmmakers a check for 1 4 million as a rebate so the movie cost them 6 6 million and at sundance they sold it for 10 million
6327237 those are the reasons i always hear when filmmakers bypass arizona to shoot in new mexico
6327238 it is because of the tax rebates low interest loans and work force credits the state gives for hiring locals those are always the reasons
6327239 the dead included women and children as most of the fatalities occurred due to the incidents of houses collapsing
6327240 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6327241 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6327242 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6327243 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time

6327249 please look at me so you can understand the pain you caused
6327250 what you have done has affected every aspect of my life
6327251 i tend to stay indoors im afraid of people like you out on the streets
6327252 i didnt mean to do this a lot of innocent people died i dont deserve to live i apologize for everything please pray for me please
6327253 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6327254 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6327255 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6327256 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate

6327262 all of us here we make our living in the united states were protected by a wonderful armed forces and armed services group and its the thing that enables us to function
6327263 we have a great sensitivity about returning vets especially those that have been wounded and have been through a very difficult time and wed like to do our part
6327264 so the situation occurred as to what can we do to help ourselves and help others
6327265 we also have a construction and modernization company that would enable us to take the plans and specifications that are given by the va to folks like us and modify the houses to specific plans for these returning vets
6327266 so we put a program together and developed a flier which was all submitted to the va in washington d c and they loved the idea
6327267 we are prepared to sell the vets the houses at below current appraisal and then we have the ability to do one stop shopping to modify the house for the vets so it would take any of their physical challenges and make them more comfortable living in that type of environment
6327268 we would either take it off the market or we would say ok we would give the vet and va first right of refusal on any of the inventory
6327269 brought new energy to styles that until recently were considered pass
6327270 this is an excellent example of the innovative ways in which we keep elvis catalog fresh for new and existing fans
6327271 were doing the same background we did originally on the recordings in 1957
6327272 elvis sounds great the recordings sound as if they were done yesterday
6327273 i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
6327274 i dont really like fooling around with things like that all the elvis recordings are so good it kind of bothers me
6327275 some people get all upset if they mess with a classic but if you take a classic like a little less conversation i vaguely remembered that song until they redid it and now i adore it

6327306 access to capital for hispanic owned small businesses has long been known to serve as a catalyst for job growth and new job creation throughout the country
6327307 as hispanic businesses grow they must have access to the same venture capital and procurement opportunities allotted to their majority counterparts ushcc supports programs and policies that increase and secure access to both capital and government procurement and we are proud to partner with accion texas to discuss ways to expand the impact of microfinance in the hispanic business community
6327308 we are extremely pleased to address the summit with u s treasurer cabral and federal reserve chairman bernanke

6327310 this alliance means a great deal to us as real estate professionals and as advocates of homeownership
6327311 supporting fair housing opportunity is not only important to our business it is important to the community we are proud to be working with the ncrc and supporting its mission
6327312 the realogy franchise brand networks have a major presence and strong voice in real estate markets around the nation
6327313 forming this relationship with the realogy franchise group will open avenues for us to expand and celebrate homeownership for all working americans while affirming both organizations commitment to equal professional service and neighborhood diversity
6327314 there are a good percentage of students that drop out before going to high school and go to work another percent go to community college and dont finish for work related reasons or because they dont know how to navigate the system and dont know how to explore options like financial aid and scholarships they dont see college as a possibility

6327326 whats striking is that although the long term trend is toward disengagement most immigrants are involved in some form of contact with the place which theyre from
6327327 what we have is a population that as we tried to describe is between here and there
6327328 on behalf of the lulac national housing commission we wish to express our sincerest appreciation for joses contributions to the growth of our organization
6327329 we are honored to present him with the national housing advocate award for his tireless efforts to increase homeownership for all low to moderate income families
6327330 im honored to be recognized by an organization that has more than 75 years of advocating for latinos across the country

6327332 one of my best friends just left for oregon with her two babies
6327333 we hispanics are not prepared for significant posts and when we achieve them we lack help because we dont have contacts
6327334 we have different programs to offer latinos more information and opportunities
6327335 its almost impossible to get a good job without having at least four years of university
6327336 there is so much emphasis now on minority participation and women owned business that i think its a real opportunity to be successful
6327337 the growth rate for all women is impressive enough but the rate of growth in businesses among latinas is important because it shows important cultural and economic shifts about how women are viewed as entrepreneurs
6327338 the women i deal with are more visible more assertive and more successful
6327339 theres a strong entrepreneurial spirit drive and hard work we know how to balance budgets weve come a long way
6327340 i think hispanic women see other hispanic women who own their own businesses and think maybe i can do it
6327341 he told me my english was no good and he didnt need spanish speakers that he needed an american person

6327345 today there are four times as many hispanics and my business has grown
6327346 you work a lot harder but you dont punch in and out and you can keep your kids here
6327347 i think women are opening their own businesses because we have lost the fear especially the fear that we dont speak english well enough
6327348 well i used the ink i should probably keep it
6327349 i know i put that piece of paper in this stack
6327350 anyone who lives in glendale and in the surrounding communities knows of raul porto his family and the famous portos bakery what people may not know is that raul is extremely active in the glendale and burbank communities and is known for his numerous contributions to the local area we are delighted and proud to add rauls vision and wisdom to our already impressive board of directors

6327396 the outlook for the japanese economy essentially hinges on a recovery in the us economy oil prices are falling which is good news but i think it is still too early to predict the outlook
6327397 since last year we have been seeing a gradual slowdown in japans export growth the latest data confirmed this trend this is a reflection of the continued worsening of the global economy

6327404 we have sold about 90 rifles in the last seven days and are flooded with queries
6327405 we had parents accompanied by even eight to nine year olds looking for air rifles this is undoubtedly a welcome change
6327406 i had done a short training course at the rifle club but left the sport as i felt there was no future but i can see a ray of hope now so i bought this gun and have begun practising again
6327407 i always wanted to have a gun and bindras show in beijing gave me the reason i have bought an air gun for rs 2 750 and will first set my aim right and then go for a professional training after getting a gun licence
6327408 i aim to become the next bindra i bought an air gun on a day after bindras model medal show in beijing i have already spoken to a shooting coach in nagpur and would be soon joining his academy and will initially practice on air gun
6327409 one needs to put in a lot of money to take shooting as a sport but for cash rich gujaratis that shouldnt be a deterrent all they needed was inspiration
6327410 we have seen a 15 to 20 per cent jump in sales in the local as well as national market

6327430 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
6327431 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
6327432 a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider this is not one that is cost free
6327433 that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world
6327434 georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt georgias economy will be reinforced

6327488 joy satisfaction its been a busy summer we worked so hard its nice to see its paying off
6327489 this is a very sloppy report its a grubby report and i dont think it brings credit on anybody
6327490 in the view of the act government solicitor the report is a complete nonsense and should be regarded as such
6327491 i would imagine that none of the members except those that had some political motivation understood the implications or effect thats all i can assume

6327522 especially this year there have been too many close calls
6327523 when both managers come out to argue it delays the game anyway
6327524 if we can eliminate some of those its worth it
6327525 id rather it be for safe or out calls on a stolen base or bunt single
6327526 i dont think its a bad thing but its not fair for everybody

6327542 and we felt that working with these young people would be something that he would relish
6327543 i dont say that just because we won but i felt like he kind of gave us the reins to be our own men if you did something that wasnt kosher he let us know
6327544 he was a great guy we were all minor league guys and he worked well with all of us
6327545 the cups always half full with him it was great having a coach like that thats always positive

6327586 los barcos pueden todav a pescar de forma legal o ilegalmente especies amenazadas como el bacalao polar o los tiburones de profundidad
6327587 oceana denuncia las conexiones gallegas entre coca na pesca ilegal y capturas de tiburones

6327593 yeah it was important to win here we had to win one and leave a mark
6327594 im pretty sure well see these guys in the playoffs so we wanted to make a statement to avoid a sweep
6327595 i was happy to come out with a win especially with the way the bullpen has been pitching lately
6327596 a diving catch would have been great but it would have been a lot worse if i let the ball scoot by me
6327597 the at bat before i got too picky and struck out
6327598 i told myself if he throws anything over the plate im swinging i didnt get it good but i got it enough
6327599 i didnt see it and thats why i didnt call it but im the center fielder ive got to get that ball
6327600 its a gift anymore to have a legislator who can really dig into a complex issue and be able to mete out a fair deal the stuff that people used to do up here that make things work
6327601 when you look at the scope of the bill its pretty significant
6327602 one issue everyone has been afraid to touch is land use
6327603 everyone understands about using alternative fuel but land use has been the third rail ab 32 changed the equation because now land use has to be part of the solution to global warming you cant meet our goal just with alternative fuels you have to reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled
6327604 if people are going to drive and they are going to drive we need to plan in ways to get them out of their cars faster that means shrinking not the amount of housing not economic development not growth but shrinking the footprint on which that growth occurs
6327605 he was delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of god

6327611 i think about the millions of people who live in apartments in los angeles that dont even have a backyard they need a place to go
6327612 and if they dont have a small local park they could always know they could go to griffith park thats the way my great grandfather saw it
6327613 the only other direction you could do is to commercialize it
6327614 he just saw it as a safety valve for the public
6327615 people like to go there to get away from the city to hike in a quiet area with not too many cars around and just enjoy nature he always wanted it to be a free park and for everybody
6327616 they had this old thing that you cranked around it showed you going into space showed you all the stars

6327619 california led the way into our culture of car dependence so it is only appropriate that the state lead the way out
6327620 it sends a message to the bad element out there that were not going to sit back and let you terrorize these neighborhoods
6327621 its about making sure that small percentage thats causing the problem gets reined in and is taken away
6327622 are they arresting people because theyre robbing killing or selling drugs or are they just targeting people because of the way they dress
6327623 my husband wears baggy clothes and hes not in a gang

6327669 i was looking for something in the middle of the plate and jurrjens threw me a pretty good changeup and i took it he came back with a fastball and i was able to punch one up the middle
6327670 theyll get mad at you if you dont push the envelope
6327671 there was a delay because i didnt know where the ball was
6327672 usually when theres a lack of hustle its not in the ninth inning down by one whoever is saying that doesnt know about baseball that doesnt bother me one bit
6327673 it looked like he was out of whack from the beginning a lot of times when you get jammed youre not sure where you hit it i remember paul oneill used to hit balls and hed have no idea where he hit them wed be screaming for him to run
6327674 i made a really wide turn around first thats what im guilty of
6327675 my only regret is that i wish i would have picked up the ball right away and had a better turn that guy just made an unbelievable play
6327676 if you look at our numbers its no secret that we havent really done what we need to do with men on base
6327677 if we have a two run deficit i dont try for second if were not in a tie game in anaheim i dont try to steal third there are a lot of factors most notably the scoreboard which dictates how you play the game
6327678 you take more calculated risks rather than being passive because ive always found that in baseball fortune always favors the bold if you sit back and wait for the game to come to you it wont

6327686 im vergleich zu den verbrauchern in den usa zeigen die verbraucher in deutschland und im vereinigten k nigreich bei den 13 in der studie untersuchten technologien ein bedeutend st rkeres interesse an alternativen antriebstechnologien insbesondere bei sauberen dieseltechnologien
6327687 der interessenunterschied kann auf die tendenz der verbraucher in den eu m rkten kleinere fahrzeuge zu kaufen die wiederum der hybridelektrischen technologie zutr glicher sind zur ckgef hrt werden dieseltechnologie ist zudem in diesen regionen viel verbreiteter als in den usa
6327688 geringes interesse an satellitenradios ist auf die geringe marktdurchdringung dieser technik sowohl in deutschland als auch im vereinigten k nigreich zur ckzuf hren
6327689 allerdings ist es wahrscheinlich dass mit dem auftauchen neuer satellitenradiobetreiber nicht nur die bekanntheit sondern auch das allgemeine interesse an dieser funktion zunimmt
6327690 the strike was spontaneous with eight crore people participating in it it is an expression of deep indignation of the masses against the pernicious economic and labour policies of the united progressive alliance government
6327691 this should be a warning bell for the government because if it does not respond we will prolong this agitation the sponsoring committee of trade unions will meet again in september first week to chalk out further course of action
6327692 the government should realise that all the friends of american president george bush are gone and it should be ready to face the same fate if it tries to suppress the masses
6327693 they wanted to throw a bunch of producers at me
6327694 i said no i have to go at this alone i had been controlled so much as an actor on the set youre always controlled by the desires and wishes of the writer director producers the studio and the will of the other actors i needed to step into this field myself

6327703 whoever is the best liar is the best actor it took me to be 28 years old before i realized that its the person that tells the truth is the best actor because its truth that gives life lies take it away
6327704 i could do vocal gymnastics and work with a vocal coach and get my vocals to the point where i can do backflips and somersaults and maybe move somebody
6327705 but they wont have a direction to go in unless im singing from my heart i dont have some incredible voice but i sing all these songs with the same passion that i experienced the stimuli that made me write them
6327706 its more important to keep that truth in it than to make it perfect

6327716 thaksin is a criminal who ran away from the justice system he does not deserve to carry a thai diplomatic passport
6327717 i think given the spirit of the mou memorandum of understanding which up front stated that within the spirit of the agreement no party was going to convene parliament or formulate a cabinet before an agreement is signed moving to swear in parliament is in part a breach of the memorandum of understanding however we need to make a qualification there that the contestation in the talks right now is not about the swearing in of parliament is in dispute but i think the most critical point which zanu pf and president robert mugabe moves beyond that he would be crossing the rules is assembling the cabinet
6327718 assembling cabinet will actually be vesting authority in institutions and i think that will amount to be in total breach of the negotiating process and by extension it will undermine the talks
6327719 the opposition has no problem in the opening of parliament insofar as the swearing in of parliament comes in from the results of the march 29 elections which by and large the mdc has actually stated that it reflects the will of the people what the bone of contention is based on the march 29 elections which leads to the swearing in of parliament the assembly of cabinet put mugabe in a position where he uses the june 27 results that he would use for vesting himself as the president to assemble a cabinet and that is where the dispute is and that is where it will undermine the talks and the spirit of the mou
6327720 when you read the mou it states that before the agreement is signed parliament and cabinet should not be sworn in and the cabinet should not be assembled but i think the mou was based not only on an understanding but also on an assumption by the facilitator that by then they would have rapped up the deal and there would have been a concrete deal on the table and all the parties would have signed up to it so i think this issues have been long drawn and it is a long haul and there is no signature appended to this process by all the parties it actually brings into question the issue of a breach of the memorandum of understanding which says parliament and cabinet shouldnt have been assembled
6327721 i think the move is meaningless for the simple reason that what he can only get from there is that is how the issues of the speaker of our parliament is going to be nominated i think that is where the only leverage is but the battleground is the cabinet
6327722 the cancellation of the memorandum of agreement is a painful step in our collective effort to come to an agreement with the milf
6327723 she president arroyo will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of law set within the constitution

6327734 life applies to those that are not born as well as those that are born
6327735 in the past youve alienated a great deal of conservatives who believe that conservative principles are always the answer by stepping across the aisle
6327736 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can actually rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone who will cause us to want to stay home perhaps
6327737 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6327738 were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you therell be another one of these firestorms
6327739 any choice he makes for vice president will have pros and cons
6327740 not as far as i can tell a one issue party that would be just one issue among many that would have to be evaluated by the party
6327741 todays partnering agreement secures the long term supply of ammunitions to our armed forces

6327812 i have been far and wide and this journey although it took months was nothing but a drop of water in the ocean of my own personal voyage we walked for eons it seemed and survived with nothing but my honest words through the scorching deserts and in the end each person found their respite resting in a hallowed hall comforted by all they had ever longed for
6327813 but you are here with me and we will die together my last act is destroying you and i can take contentment in that

6327819 we have had no such talks as far as i know we know there are always lots of rumours like this in the markets but we are not in formal talks with lehman or other firms on stake investments
6327820 it seems there are no signs when the us credit problems may eventually end
6327821 the firms we cover lehman in particular continue to have significant exposures to the troubled asset classes with the exception of leveraged loans these exposures have proven difficult to remove or to hedge effectively as the market for these positions remains relatively illiquid as long as these firms have these troubled assets their earnings results will be affected by the fluctuations in the fixed income market

6327823 the current economic conditions the uncertainties surrounding the general financial markets and mortgage availability will be defining factors in the return to a more normal housing market

6327831 theres a lot of good competition going among the offense and defense on the field theyre taking a lot of pride in that

6327837 is it just me or does embolden already belong on the list of words that will be verboten come 2009
6327838 in retrospect we probably shouldnt have egged the georgians on prior to their attack on south ossetia or emboldened them in the first place by supporting their aspirations for membership in nato so i guess if theres one thing ive learned from the past eight years of the bush administration its that emboldening is bad whether youre emboldening the terrorists or emboldening our allies the consequences are uniformly unhappy so take a personal inventory of your life and make sure that youre not enabling emboldening remember friends dont embolden friends or enemies either um in fact everybody just stop with the boldness right now 13 aug 2008 which books have you read post this list on your blog and embolden the ones which you have which have you read

6327849 it is time to get off our offense and onto some new meat

6327852 the good thing about bryson is he is pretty reliable the thing about matt is he brings a lot of big plays to us but weve got to get him more consistent

6327868 the world is embracing the sport that the dream teamers brought to barcelona
6327869 and i would say the 2008 olympics really demonstrate that complete embrace
6327870 you know i didnt even dare to think about that
6327871 the question was one step at a time if youve been along on the journey sometimes you dont realize how far youve come
6327872 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6327873 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6327874 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6327875 i do think there is some relief that comes with the filing of the report it allows us to bring closure to what is a sad and embarrassing situation for the university

6327891 no obstante esos avances que fueron significativos en los primeros a os de desarrollo de la norma han tendido a estancarse por lo cual subsisten problemas muy serios de inequidad universalidad y calidad del servicio de salud
6327892 lo cual parece contrario al principio de no discriminaci n que debe gobernar las pol ticas sociales
6327893 se trata de un modelo mec nico que busca la eficiencia econ mica y no la satisfacci n del derecho a la salud
6327894 por esa raz n el congreso lo reform mediante la ley 100 el nuevo sistema basado en el aseguramiento elimina el efecto del ingreso sobre el uso de servicios dando cabida tanto a los que tienen como a los pobres
6327895 en resumen el sistema de salud colombiano muestra gradualidad hacia el cumplimiento de los objetivos de universalidad expresado como afiliaci n al sistema y aumento en la equidad y en el uso de servicios avanza de manera sostenida al cumplimiento de las metas adoptadas por los convenios internacionales
6327896 a largo plazo le aporta estabilidad al sistema permite la participaci n social les da a las personas la condici n de cliente fundamental de los prestadores permite el manejo de recursos con destinaci n espec fica provee mecanismos para identificar a los beneficiarios mejora la eficiencia y estimula la calidad

6327907 thanks to this generous grant we can work with experts in automatic speech recognition and in brain imaging at other universities to research a brain computer interface with applications in military medical and commercial settings
6327908 such a system would require extensive training for anyone using it to send and receive messages
6327909 initially communication would be based on a limited set of words or phrases that are recognized by the system it would involve more complex language and speech as the technology is developed further

6327934 all of us here we make our living in the united states were protected by a wonderful armed forces and armed services group and its the thing that enables us to function
6327935 we have a great sensitivity about returning vets especially those that have been wounded and have been through a very difficult time and wed like to do our part
6327936 so the situation occurred as to what can we do to help ourselves and help others
6327937 we also have a construction and modernization company that would enable us to take the plans and specifications that are given by the va to folks like us and modify the houses to specific plans for these returning vets
6327938 so we put a program together and developed a flier which was all submitted to the va in washington d c and they loved the idea
6327939 we are prepared to sell the vets the houses at below current appraisal and then we have the ability to do one stop shopping to modify the house for the vets so it would take any of their physical challenges and make them more comfortable living in that type of environment
6327940 we would either take it off the market or we would say ok we would give the vet and va first right of refusal on any of the inventory

6327952 intel is early enough with stereo 3 d that they can still influence that path and may be able to carve out an intellectual property stake in the technology
6327953 intel is finally becoming a player here and dreamworks will give them credibility
6327954 intel has the capability to bring real insights into the needs of stereo 3 d in silicon and tools
6327955 there are a lot of interesting technologies to bring stereo 3 d to the tv but it is still in an early stage
6327956 once the tv can handle todays polarized 3 d glasses the technology will take off in a big way
6327957 the 3 d tools used today have largely been created internally inside the studios
6327958 eliminating the cost of developing these tools will really help
6327959 the pc ification of stereo 3 d could be a major catalyst for this transition

6327970 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy

6327994 by financially punishing noncompliant states with the loss of federal funding the regulation would intrude on the authority of states to enact and enforce laws that ensure womens access to birth control

6327996 pregnancy is not a disease to be treated by abortion and neither is fertility

6328011 los 700 profesionales a efectivizar llevan m s de dos a os como becarios y son parte de un total de 1200 cuya efectivizaci n se acord tambi n acordamos que todo profesional que se retire sea reemplazado
6328012 el 18 de marzo acordamos con el ministro zin el pase a planta permanente de los becarios como el tr mite de nombramiento de un profesional interino tarda un a o y medio el ministro ofreci un mecanismo para que la incorporaci n y el cobro se efect en en 60 d as a fin de contar con profesionales en servicios cr ticos
6328013 que se incluya como r gimen desfavorable el trabajo en los hospitales de guernica y jos c paz como ya sucede en los de escobar y gonz lez cat n esto implica un salario mayor en lugares donde cuesta mucho conseguir profesionales agreg yabkowski tambi n se convino en que a las m dicas con embarazo avanzado o que amamantan se les permite reemplazar las guardias de 24 horas por otras tareas
6328014 ya pasaron cerca de 90 d as pero el ministerio de econom a y el gobierno provincial no habilitan el acuerdo cada 20 d as nos dicen que est a la firma
6328015 si bien los paros incluyen tambi n el reclamo de actualizaci n salarial se levantar n en cuanto el gobierno concrete lo acordado

6328021 es bueno que el poder judicial act e para esclarecer

6328025 me parece medio apresurado comenzar a amenazar con nuevos paros estamos tratando de buscar una propuesta que se pueda consensuar
6328026 hay que buscar un precio que puedan recibir los productores que las industrias lo puedan pagar y adem s que se mantenga tambi n una expectativa de crecimiento de la actividad l ctea
6328027 dieses ergebnis war eine gro e berraschung f r uns
6328028 insgesamt zwei speziell ausgebildete hunde unterst tzen das artenschutzteam jetzt
6328029 wir haben vor gut einem jahr dem deutschen zoll unser konzept vorgestellte damals h tte ich nicht vermutet dass bereits im sommer 2008 in frankfurt artenschutzsp rhunde auf patrouille gehen
6328030 wir haben es hierbei mit einer sehr gut organisierten schmuggelmafia zu tun
6328031 das problem dabei ist dass nicht nur die arten durch derartigen handel gef hrdet werden sondern dass zudem ein enormer ansturm auf die einheimischen zoos losbricht denn in denen werden die eingeschmuggelten tiere dann betreut
6328032 sie k nnen selbst objekte mit geringem eigengeruch wahrnehmen und sind daher ideal f r die schnelle kontrolle von gep ckst cken postsendungen oder ganzen containern
6328033 es ist mir ein pers nliches anliegen den artenschmuggel zu bek mpfen und so zum berleben bedrohter tier und pflanzenarten beizutragen
6328034 el fen meno de la explotaci n sexual infantil se ha extendido mucho en el pa s y por regiones donde antes estaba invisibilizado como el sur
6328035 aunque no se oferta abiertamente el turismo sexual est absolutamente generalizado
6328036 por nuestro trabajo conocemos que el fen meno se ha extendido mucho incluso por regiones donde no estaba visibilizado como el sur el fen meno se ha ido agravando por las condiciones de vulnerabilidad generadas a partir de la crisis de 2001
6328037 hoy por ayer hemos decidido volver a encarrilar al consejo de seguridad y por ello hemos presentado un proyecto de resoluci n que reproduce palabra por palabra los seis puntos del plan de paz del presidente sarkozy y el presidente dmitri medvedev
6328038 han pasado varios d as desde que se firm el acuerdo de seis puntos y no vemos se al alguna de una retirada significativa de las tropas rusas
6328039 the biggest concern weve always had in my eyes has been our return game
6328040 weve been looking for that dynamic guy that can give us some energy i think if we can find a couple of return guys to really give us some energy some spark then i think we can have an above average special teams
6328041 its sorting itself out a little bit but its still pretty open
6328042 i always like my chances its just a matter of putting it through the uprights
6328043 we see how well we all do then it makes us work harder
6328044 when one guy does a little bit better than the other two we work harder and it makes us all better at the end
6328045 well spend a little bit more time meeting and working on some things from that perspective its just a natural thing to do base on where our team is and how theyre moving and how theyre feeling and it should help them be even better toward our goal in about 11 days
6328046 what we had scheduled for this afternoon was really a rest for the guys in terms of what we did on the field
6328047 we call it a mock game and that game is more for the coaches than it is for the players the players go out and kind of go through things lightly and the coaches are really working on down and distance substitutions and those kinds of things that we need to do to have ourselves game ready
6328048 its still too early to say who will be the starter but im very confident and comfortable with where he is today
6328049 la intervenci n quir rgica a que se someti era sin fines terap uticos sino para procurar el perfeccionamiento f sico de la persona por lo que pod a realizarla en otra ocasi n en que no interfiriera con sus labores
6328050 en octubre de 2005 la empleada notific en forma verbal a la empleadora que ten a la intenci n de realizarse un implante mamario hecho que luego fue notificado mediante un telegrama
6328051 es decir que la empleadora ten a pleno conocimiento de que la actora se iba a ausentar de sus labores durante el plazo se alado
6328052 no est a n comprobado aunque as lo diga la provincia
6328053 comienza la cuenta regresiva hasta el 15 de septiembre cuando termina el plazo de la comisi n que definir la deuda previsional si no hay una respuesta la ciudad ser un caos
6328054 si no hay respuesta oficial hasta ma ana vamos a ir a un nuevo paro provincial y profundizaremos las medidas
6328055 la reuni n de la ucr oficial fue m s bien una expresi n de deseo de ellos
6328056 cuestiones de fondo de funcionamiento y sobre todo con algunos nombres
6328057 nosotros no tenemos ning n apuro ni nos interesa por ahora volver al radicalismo que el partido haga primero todo lo que tiene que hacer y despu s en todo caso veremos
6328058 ahora porque les conviene quieren que volvamos pero ya sabemos c mo es la historia despu s cuando llegan las elecciones van a venir a negociar lugares en las listas el tema es que ellos no representan a nadie y nosotros somos los que ganamos las elecciones aun por fuera del partido
6328059 sobre 104 empresas donantes 28 est n relacionadas con servicios de salud o medicina representan el 35 4 por ciento del total de los ingresos recibidos con un monto de 4 512 000 pesos
6328060 la idea es ir descomprimiendo mostrando otros gestos estamos dispuestos a charlar va a ser una reuni n de tema abierto
6328061 no cabe duda de que la campa a para desacreditar a obama le est dando resultado a mccain ahora
6328062 tuvo una aventura ad ltera antes de abandonar a su mujer lisiada disfruta de ocho residencias en todo el pa s as como de aviones corporativos
6328063 tenemos un buen y pr spero momento con bajo de sempleo
6328064 el precio del petr leo ha subido el precio de la leche ha subido
6328065 es verdad que desde hace un tiempo estamos encontrando mucho m s para quejarnos en los avisos de mccain
6328066 uno puede ser negativo con bajo perfil y eso es lo que l ha hecho creo que la percepci n es que todav a est haciendo una campa a positiva
6328067 es una estrategia inteligente de polic a bueno polic a malo
6328068 econom a por john mccain apoyen a george bush el 95 por ciento del tiempo sigan gastando 10 mil millones de d lares por mes en una guerra en irak

6328070 tasaci n de las compa as se realizara tomando como base los valores a la fecha de la intervenci n 16 de junio
6328071 es otra cosa es otro proyecto as como est es muy dif cil no acompa ar los cambios son buenos pero c mo combin s lo que dice el texto de los fundamentos con el proyecto de ley y el acta acuerdo
6328072 el acta contiene cl usulas lesivas para el inter s p blico no es suficiente que se borre del proyecto de ley
6328073 el acuerdo fue un atajo para avanzar sobre la empresa por una necesidad puntual que se dio a principios de junio el tribunal de tasaci n ya nos adelant en una primera mirada que hicieron que el valor de aerol neas ser negativo
6328074 al momento de la intervenci n el flujo de fondos de aa era negativo por lo tanto la empresa ya deber a ser del estado
6328075 por qu se le dar n cr ditos al grupo marsans si est en concurso y en cesaci n de pagos si la empresa no puede pagar los sueldos de sus empleados c mo van a devolverle la plata al estado
6328076 comprar la deuda de aerol neas y que se deber a rechazar expl citamente el acta acuerdo
6328077 todos los manejos dolosos de marsans ser n denunciados por la bicameral
6328078 we want expect to end up being as fossilised as the telco engineers we have kind of done out of a job
6328079 we dont want to get into the business of deciding who a country is
6328080 if it doesnt catch on we can always delete it
6328081 remain open to the absurdity and possible lunacy of the internet

6328105 es impresionante hay trozos de cad veres en un amplio per metro en torno al avi n
6328106 ua doccia gelata quando mi dissero che dovevo lasciare napoli
6328107 avevo disputato una grande stagione con gli azzurri culminata con la promozione in serie a dopo parecchi anni avevo una gran voglia di far bene anche in un campionato molto pi difficile della serie cadetta ma una sera mi chiam il mio procuratore dicendomi che la societ mi avevano venduto al torino per circa 8 miliardi fu una doccia gelata lasciare la piazza e il calore di napoli stato difficilissimo per me resto nella storia azzurra al pari con sallustro per il maggior numero di reti siglate in una stagione una gioia immensa che porter con me per sempre sar per sempre legato alla maglia azzurra
6328108 certo il rammarico grande perch quella squadra si era amalgamata benissimo senza cambiare tecnico e senza rivoluzionare completamente tutto lo staff sia dirigenziale sia il parco giocatori quel napoli sicuramente non sarebbe sceso in serie b subito
6328109 secondo me ora completo sono state apportate le modifiche necessarie lo scorso anno zalayeta e lavezzi gi avevano fatto vedere di essere attaccanti di spessore ora con gli inserimenti di denis e russotto credo che il puzzle sia completo ritengo ci sia il giusto mix di forza concretezza e imprevedibilit che fanno si che la squadra di reja possa facilmente piazzarsi alle spalle delle big
6328110 partendo dal fatto che sono per la linea per i giovani non ritengo sia unutopia che vitale possa fare bene in questo campionato ha tutte le qualit per imporsi c da vedere per come il giocatore sappia sopportare le pressioni della piazza che essendo affamata di calcio sempre molto esigente se dovesse partita dopo partita acquisire sempre pi fiducia credo diventer la sorpresa degli azzurri
6328111 sicuramente juve e milan sono attrezzate meglio ma lentusiasmo dei tifosi napoletani potrebbe sopperire ad una leggera mancanza tecnica quindi credo gli azzurri siano nettamente favoriti dal fattore ambientale
6328112 il calcio cambiato ci sono pochissimi giocatori che possono risolvere le partite da soli per esperienza personale sono rimasto stupefatto dalle giocate di zidane che per me tra i cinque giocatori pi forti della storia del calcio
6328113 il gol pi bello lho siglato nel derby vicenza verona cross dalla trequarti e conclusione allincrocio lapoteosi invece il pi emozionante sicuramente quello della promozione in a con gli azzurri a pistoia allo stadio toscano cerano circa 6000 tifosi azzurri un emozione incredibile solo se ci penso mi vengono i brividi
6328114 senza dubbio giovinco che ha grosse potenzialit ma provo anche ammirazione per lanzafame del palermo
6328115 la st bernard cest bien mais la st bernard on offre pas des chiens
6328116 i am not sure the design community is the leader in that particularly

6328123 design is an incredibly important dispostion of young people to have
6328124 we come across as not having an agenda as being really nice guys

6328133 el vicefiscal no rechaz los dos testimonios de los paramilitares simplemente crey que no justificaban el arresto

6328148 ber das schwermetall thallium in der arktis gibt es bisher kaum untersuchungen
6328149 wie verschiedene chemikalien in die nahrungskette gelangen ist uns ja bekannt was aber immer noch weitgehend unbekannt ist ist die frage was geschieht wenn verschiedene chemikalien gemeinsam auftreten
6328150 es ist zwar neu dass man l nger vor dem video oder vor dem computer sitzt aber das hat offensichtlich keine auswirkungen auf den generellen energieverbrauch

6328152 el m s importante es que dos de los tres represores llegan al juicio excarcelados y en libertad y eso es un acto de violencia para los testigos

6328169 para tener un trato preferente hay que ser hermano de un ministro o terrorista
6328170 sin que exista alusi n alguna a posibles intervenciones de coadyuvantes
6328171 es evidente que no concurre la espec fica circunstancia que justifica la nica excepci n a la regla general sobre la intervenci n de coadyuvantes en los recursos de inconstitucionalidad pues los partidos pol ticos no se encuentran entre los sujetos legitimados por la constituci n y la lotc para intervenir activa o pasivamente
6328172 en la defensa de los intereses de los ciudadanos que afirman encarnar
6328173 dado el car cter estrictamente objetivo y abstracto del recurso de inconstitucionalidad no pueden hacerse valer en l intereses distintos a la pura o simple impugnaci n o defensa de la ley recurrida
6328174 los partidos pol ticos no son representantes pol ticos de los ciudadanos

6328187 dont just keep throwing stuff over the wall and expect consumers to believe we are innovators
6328188 in this panel media executives from the worlds of advertising content and new media will discuss the positive and negative impact of the convergence of the online and offline world on todays content
6328189 i dont want to be associated with moronic trash that gets posted on the internet

6328216 me ha impresionado que la esposa de una de las v ctimas ten a un mensaje que dec a que el avi n estaba estropeado y que les iban a cambiar
6328217 inmensa tristeza para madrid y los madrile os y todos los espa oles
6328218 el dolor de las familias que han perdido a sus seres queridos y la tristeza inmensa de las personas como las vacaciones se han truncado en una tragedia sin precedentes
6328219 there are a lot of people questioning if youre going to come back and how youll come back
6328220 you came into this league hungrier than heck and led your team to a championship and now people think youve fallen off with your injuries
6328221 if i was you id be really upset about that id come in with a chip on my shoulder
6328222 i was written off in one year quicker than anybody had ever been
6328223 being injured it was like i had forgotten how to play basketball but it made me hungry and it put me back in the position where ive always been and thats the underdog
6328224 he hasnt just come back at the level he was
6328225 you need things to push you and i found them
6328226 there are always things that are going to push you
6328227 from the moment he arrived there was just a look in his eyes that we hadnt seen before
6328228 you end up working with a lot of guys who think they know everything but he doesnt ever go halfway hes a perfectionist
6328229 its about being in a place like this making it to beijing seeing things in life
6328230 this might not be your dream growing up in robbins to go to the great wall but you see where your dream can take you

6328238 the internet is completely undermining journalism and it will continue to do so
6328239 new media emerged for a reason dissatisfaction with existing media
6328240 there is proper journalism online from bbc rte guardian but others are cool hunting and stretching themselves thinly
6328241 dont fall for victim mentality need to incorporate new media into journalism nick davies might argue that prs are killing journalism adrian monck might argue that bad business decisions are responsible and journalist also killing journalism eg jayson blair bloggers dont want to kill journalism it is the teat on which they suckle people want transparency and interaction note that jeff jarvis has a print column and book to be published oppose motion

6328277 mit langzeitbelastung waren m rsche ab 20 kilometern gemeint diesen wert auf ranzen und schulkinder anzuwenden ist v llig unrealistisch

6328287 the uk has a long and distinguished record in promoting altitude research and the study of altitude related illness many travellers from the uk take to the hills for recreation or business so this is relevant to our local population
6328288 it was a great opportunity to climb with some top guides so i have learned or brushed up on lots of climbing skills the academic side was superb with lectures from some of the most famous people in altitude physiology and i have practised my pre hospital care skills which is great for a teaching hospital medic like me
6328289 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s and worldwide and that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases
6328290 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6328291 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6328292 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6328293 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6328294 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6328295 there are very few drugs with strong evidence of effectiveness in treating trigeminal neuralgia
6328296 if people fail to respond to these drugs physicians should not be reluctant to consider referring the patient for surgery often surgery is considered a last resort and patients suffer while the well intentioned physician tries other medications with limited effectiveness
6328297 if patients dont respond well to carbamazepine or one or two other drugs it is reasonable to consider surgery that targets the root of the trigeminal nerve
6328298 people with trigeminal neuralgia should be aware of the availability of surgical treatments and discuss these options with their physicians
6328299 although there is a small minority of parents who object to the vaccine because of their beliefs about sexuality and the fact that it prevents a sexually transmitted infection to most parents the mode of transmission is not whats important
6328300 the families who are struggling with what to do about this vaccine are focused on issues like safety
6328301 they want us to have more experience with it and have it used by more people
6328302 we tend to overrate the power of conservative forces in our society on the everyday lives of people for example roman catholics use contraception and have abortions at about the same rates as other women in this country
6328303 we at pbh are devoted to helping moms realize that it is not only important to meet their familys daily requirements for fruit and vegetable intake but it is affordable and easy
6328304 using strategies that focus on fruits and veggies that are fresh frozen canned and dried as well as including 100 percent juice allow families to learn which fruits and vegetables they enjoy and which they will choose to meet their daily requirement which ranges from 2 to 6 1 2 cups each day

6328314 modern writers injure the smoothness of our tongue by omitting vowels wherever it is possible and joining the harshest consonants together with only an apostrophe between thus for judged in it self not the smoothest of words they say

6328319 there are tax cut activists around the country who are very interested in what were doing here
6328320 if it does well we may see copycat initiatives in 2010 and 2012 across the country
6328321 a cut of this magnitude would severely reduce the ability of the commonwealth to provide the services that citizens and taxpayers have come to expect from their state government

6328331 so im not going to discount him playing in the opener or the third week of the season im just going to say that right now he will not play against jacksonville theres a chance he might not be ready for a couple weeks
6328332 im not happy with it to be honest with you
6328333 im sick for davin joseph hes one of the ringleaders on this football team so im disappointed im hurt for him im also confident that we have the stuff to pick up the slack while hes getting himself ready to play obviously its a tough blow for us here at this time but its also very exciting for somebody to step up
6328334 were working on our rotations at this point in time
6328335 obviously jeremy zuttah will be a factor at that position dan buenning has experience playing guard there are the possibilities of adding a player here or there so i dont want to say too much right now at this point were confident in the guys we have

6328341 the administration is sensitive to public sentiments and the president is also committed to upholding the constitution
6328342 in doing so she will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of the law set within the constitution
6328343 the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace

6328348 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6328349 he conducted an adulterous affair before leaving his disabled wife enjoys eight residences across the country as well as corporate jets
6328350 we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment
6328351 the prices of gas are up the prices of milk are up
6328352 we certainly for a while were finding a lot more in mccains ads to complain about
6328353 if you can go quietly negative thats what hes done i think the perception is that hes still running the positive campaign

6328363 en algunos casos ten a que ver con la superstici n que difund an los curanderos tradicionales de que la cura para el sida consist a en mantener relaciones sexuales con un menor
6328364 la primera vez que vi a warrington pens este ni o es muy muy especial
6328365 es seropositivo desde que naci y su madre muri cuando ten a seis a os pero est lleno de amor le horroriza que insulten o hieran a otros ni os y es muy valiente le llamo el activista porque no s lo habla sin tapujos de su enfermedad pese a que la gente es cruel y a veces se r e de l sino que insiste en ir por todas partes predicando el mensaje de la prevenci n contra el sida y el tratamiento antisida
6328366 me daba mucho miedo pero me encant estar entre las nubes
6328367 el mensaje que transmito es que ante todo la gente debe superar su miedo y dejarse hacer la prueba del vih
6328368 en segundo lugar deben ser sinceros sobre su condici n si son positivos para poder obtener tratamiento y para que sus familiares y amigos les apoyen tercero tienen que seguir un r gimen de tratamiento que es muy riguroso y debe ser observado durante el resto de su vida esta ltima parte es en lo que consiste principalmente mi trabajo seguir la pista de los que no cumplen viajar a todas partes para encontrar a ni os que por lo que me informan los hospitales no est n siguiendo las reglas de los arv
6328369 explico a la gente que los arv ayudan y que es un error creer que te hacen enfermar no me canso siempre me divierto pero advierto a todos que cuando empiezan tienen que seguir o si no volver n a estar enfermos y pondr n sus vidas en peligro si sigues el r gimen te curar s como me he curado yo en la cl nica veo a otros ni os que toman los arv y est n gordos y tienen unas caras preciosas
6328370 la necesidad de comer de forma saludable sobre todo verduras como espinacas remolacha y col cuando est s tomando arv
6328371 lo bueno ahora es que si antes de los arv un resultado positivo significaba la muerte ahora con el seguimiento y con apoyo en casa significa la vida
6328372 dejo que sean ellos los que lean el resultado en la tarjeta y vean las frases que dan el diagn stico sobre su sangre y que sean ellos los que digan si es el caso soy positivo lloro por dentro pero debo mantener siempre una actitud fr a y profesional y siempre siempre resistir el impulso de abrazarlos

6328374 una de las cosas m s dif ciles que tenemos que hacer y para la que necesitamos prepararnos

6328376 tengo dos sobrinos que murieron de l y una sobrina que es seropositiva tengo un hermano que era licenciado universitario y se suicid cuando descubri que era positivo tengo otro hermano que es seropositivo y su hijo tambi n mi hijo y su mujer son seropositivos
6328377 la maldici n que a n padecemos es que la gente sigue sin decirlo sigue teniendo verg enza y si no se dice no hay tratamiento porque eso no es algo que se pueda ocultar
6328378 vamos a echar al sida de frica vamos a luchar contra el estigma el sida no discrimina discrimina la gente

6328389 we have moved through our days like dancers not needing to touch more than lightly because we were instinctively moving to the same rhythm
6328390 a good relationship has a pattern like a dance and is built on some of the same rules the partners do not need to hold on tightly because they move confidently in the same pattern intricate but gay and swift and free like a country dance of mozarts to touch heavily would be to arrest the pattern and freeze the movement to check the endlessly changing beauty of its unfolding there is no place here for the possessive clutch the clinging arm the heavy hand now arm in arm now back to back it does not matter which because they know they arae partners moving to the same rhythm creating a pattern together and being invisibly nourished by it
6328391 but how does one learn this technique of the dance
6328392 the only real security is not in owning or possessing not in demanding or expecting not in hoping even security in a relationship lies neither in looking back to what it was in nostalgia nor forward to what it might be in dread or anticipation but living the present relationship and accepting it as it is now
6328393 one must accept the security of the winged life of ebb and flow of intermittency intermittency an impossible lesson for human beings to learn how can one learn to live through the ebb tides of ones existence how can one learn to take the trough of the wave it is easier to understand here on the beach where the breathlessly still ebb tides reveal another life below the level which mortals usually reach in this crystalline moment of suspense one has a sudden revelation of the secret kingdom at the bottom of the sea here in the shallow flats one finds wading through warm ripples great horse conchs pivoting on a leg white sand dollars marble medallions engraved in the mud and myriads of bright colored cochina clams glistening in the foam their shells opening and shutting like butterflies wings so beautiful is the still hour of the seas withdrawal as beautiful as the seas return when the encroaching waves pound up the beach pressing to reach those dark rumpled chains of seaweed which mark the last high tide
6328394 we have been informed by the hong kong authorities that mr gadd was denied entry to hong kong and has returned to bangkok
6328395 mr gadd was in contact with us seeking consular assistance
6328396 he must definitely be coming back to bangkok since hong kong refused to let him in
6328397 we will have to expel him either back to vietnam or britain or another country where he wants to go
6328398 i dont know his arrival time or flight number but i think he will land mid afternoon because his name was not on any of the passenger lists this morning

6328408 per me i russi erano vittime del regime totalitario comunista e presonalmente non provo nessun odio nei loro confronti credo che un simile atteggiamento sta lentamente nascendo in tutto il nostro paese

6328435 right now the challenge for photovoltaics is to make the technology less expensive
6328436 therefore the objective is find new materials and novel device structures for cost effective photovoltaic devices
6328437 the beauty of organic photovoltaics and organic leds is low cost and flexibility
6328438 these devices can be fabricated by inexpensive solution based processing techniques similar to painting or printing
6328439 the ease of production brings costs down while the mechanical flexibility of the materials opens up a wide range of applications
6328440 the research at sdsu is focused on new materials with variable band gaps
6328441 the band gap determines how much solar energy the photovoltaic device can absorb and convert into electricity
6328442 were working on synthesizing novel polymers with variable band gaps including high medium and low band gap varieties to absorb the full spectrum of sunlight by this we can double the light harvesting or absorption
6328443 we are working to develop these new light emitting and efficient charge transporting materials to improve the light emitting efficiency of full color displays

6328493 the public purse should not just be used to mop up the problems caused by banking difficulties the government should recognise that councils are well placed to take a judicious share of mortgage business an opportunity that could yield a surplus for the council tax payer

6328589 while there is always a lead lag relationship between production retail sales and new registrations in a specific time frame the differences in june are significant and can not be attributed to late reporting or a typical lead lag pattern

6328603 commodization is an erosive competitive condition where it is very difficult for your customers to perceive any meaningful distinction between your products and services and those of your competitors
6328604 if your customers cant perceive any meaningful distinction between your products or services and everyone elses then theyll almost certainly buy the least expensive one
6328605 this leads to lowest cost being the sole basis for competition a strategy that only the most efficient companies can make work and usually only at razor thin margins
6328606 this is why we see commodization occurring across the board in virtually every industry today
6328607 its a sure sign of a systemic failure in companies with their products and services becoming commoditized
6328608 of these three companies and their products only apple has been able to build on its iconic brand image established with one product and continue to follow up with similarly iconic products including the macbook and iphone through their systemic product development approach thats the hallmark of true corporate innovation

6328613 weve established valuable relationships with consumers who have regularly used lifeclinic blood pressure monitors to help them manage their blood pressure now with the lc600s wider array of biometric tests we can enhance their testing experience and at the same time educate them about the retailers products and services via cbss outernet digital signage network its a win win win situation for consumers product manufacturers and retail pharmacies
6328614 besides targeting and servicing the health and wellness needs of the retailers consumer which lifeclinics automated health stations do 1 000 000 times a day lifeclinic is dedicated to serving a population of people who are at the store almost every day the retailers employees
6328615 lifeclinic is committed to helping our retailer customers design and implement programs that can help control their organizations healthcare costs for example when our health stations identify an employee who is pre hypertensive there is an opportunity for early intervention and education to promote generally recommended lifestyle changes which in turn may allow the employee to forgo the need for costly medications visits to the doctor and missed days of work obviously this also benefits the employers bottom line for those people who our health stations identify as being hypertensive the employees healthcare provider can be called upon to immediately address factors such as lack of exercise unhealthy diet obesity and bad lifestyle habits and may also recommend inexpensive medication that will prevent the much higher costs of hospitalization and lost productivity

6328649 i was training as hard as i could and while my diet was healthy i figured that nutrition might be the key
6328650 so i went to a sports nutrition seminar afterwards i collared the speaker kerry kayes and we chatted about my injuries he went through my diet and said i wasnt getting enough protein it made sense so i started taking protein supplements that was the turning point
6328651 the trauma that modern triathletes put their bodies through is immense
6328652 that calls for extra protein to help muscles repair themselves to get enough extra protein from an ordinary diet would mean eating huge amounts of food and having to deal with subsequent weight issues a good protein supplement delivers the protein in a low calorie easily digested formula that gives the body what it needs when it needs it

6328728 algebra doesnt have to be difficult to learn or teach especially when we begin introducing these concepts at an early age
6328729 preparing all students for success in algebra at grade 8 requires a strong early algebra curriculum as well as a curriculum that focuses on developing concepts and skills involving fractions too many students find algebra challenging because of a poor background in fractions envisionmath develops the essential understandings and skills related to fractions needed for success in algebra
6328730 algebra concepts and skills need not be mysterious to teachers or students when they are taught with a focus on sense making furthermore all teachers can successfully teach algebra and all students can successfully learn algebra when teaching and learning are guided by envisionmath
6328731 our elementary grades program reflects the latest research about learning mathematics and already fills a void from an old model that essentially no longer exists
6328732 envisionmath sets a new standard in laying this crucial early foundation for success
6328733 one of the other critical programs we are offering for california is an algebra readiness fixed term course for eighth grade students who are not yet prepared for algebra 1
6328734 virtually all of the research in recent years confirms that in order for our students to compete in the global 21st century economy they simply must improve significantly in their understanding of math concepts and skills
6328735 mathematics is a significant obstacle for many students but this can no longer be acceptable
6328736 algebra readiness is clearly the area where we believe school districts will see the biggest impact for the money they decide to spend on new programs
6328737 it is discouraging that the state budget deficit is keeping some school districts from implementing these new programs at a time when they are most needed
6328738 middle school is what you might call the bermuda triangle of education because a significant percentage of californias kids fall behind and eventually drop out of school at this level
6328739 by focusing on algebra readiness with innovative research based programs with built in intervention and assessment we can not only do a better job of retaining students but also give them the skills and confidence to realize that they can be successful in math

6328812 there are muslim organizations which preach and work on the missionary level inside and outside pakistan
6328813 but they usually steer clear of jehad however not only has the need for jehad always existed the present conditions demand it more than ever
6328814 our jehad is confined strictly to non muslims and particularly hindus and jews the two main enemies of the muslims
6328815 to my mind the hindus are what the quran calls mushriks polutheists this hinduism is the worst form of shirk polytheism in which 30 million gods are worshipped and from here shirk has been smuggled to other nations of the world hindus are creating problems for us directly if god gives us the power we will enlarge the scope of jehad to include the jews who are the worst danger for the muslims

6328822 it is very encouraging that such a large proportion of people regard poverty hunger and disease as matters of real importance rather than just something that happens to people in poor countries
6328823 and it is also encouraging that so many are prepared to take action to help tackle issues of importance to them by using their votes and signing petitions
6328824 almost half of those polled for instance 49 per cent said they would consider using their right to write or meet with their mp about issues of concern to them
6328825 there is a lesson here for people actively involved in politics
6328826 churches faith groups and campaigning charities have the support of more than a third of the population 32 per cent while political membership in the poll stood at just six percent

6328846 since there has been a lack of major progress with private efforts in this area the states and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms will have to continue making the investments here weve already seen this with cmss medicaid transformation grants

6328852 of course any award or ranking like our inclusion in the inc 5000 is a tremendous accomplishment for actronix
6328853 however making the inc 5000 marks a particularly momentous occasion as five short years ago actronix was cash poor and faced with potential failure the fact that weve been able to rejuvenate this once struggling company to be included in the inc magazines list of the 5000 fastest growing privately held companies is a source of extreme pride for all 300 members of the actronix team

6328866 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6328867 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6328868 a developing foetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems

6328880 we are very pleased with how fast our costa rican operation came on line and the increased flexibility it offers all of our clients
6328881 we have seen a paradigm shift in marketing this year with business development and how our reputation has preceded us in a dynamic way changing the way we approach potential clients and how they reach out to us
6328882 it is designed as a start guide for anybody wanting to get their enterprise off on the right foot
6328883 todays business plans are not the 250 page behemoths of decades past
6328884 rather they are more like roadmaps that show you how to get to where you want to go
6328885 as early as 2004 when our employee base consisted of just 15 associates we made the decision not to develop an internal hr administrative department
6328886 about the time we reached 600 associates we started to evaluate alternatives mostly around hr systems we quickly eliminated the option of purchasing software and building an hr and it operations staff because again that option did not fit our corporate philosophy instead we decided on an approach in which the provider was responsible for managing and hosting a comprehensive fully integrated hr information system that met our unique needs this narrowed our search to just a few providers immediately
6328887 then as we got deeper into the evaluation of hr systems it became clear that the solution we really desired was broader than just access to good technology first we needed hr professionals with high competencies in the hr systems they used who would form a dedicated services team that was familiar with our business and who would manage our administrative workload and answer our associates calls using a devoted services center approach next we needed technologies that did more than the basics we needed technology that integrated the business processes between our management team our associates and the providers client team finally the solution had to fit within our budget constraints
6328888 going back to our corporate philosophy i mentioned that we are directed by our board to search out and implement any business solution that will free up time and capital our hr solution from platformone does both compared to the most conservative industry standards we would need 4 to 6 full time internal hr staff to administer our hr function for over 600 associates we require no it operating expense or personnel to run this solution best of all we avoided a huge capital outlay for hr software and technology infrastructure when you consider that the platformone solution meets our needs allows us to manage a single source provider relationship has been successfully implemented within our tight timeframes provides us superior day to day service response and costs 10 below the market price what more is there to ask a provider to do
6328889 psn strives to provide our dealers with the best website technology and tools
6328890 by embedding contactatonce we are able to help move more website visitors into live conversations with a dealerships sales people
6328891 historically a large percentage of the visitors to our website remained invisible to us
6328892 since adding contactatonce to our psn powered website weve seen a definite increase in the number of visitors who engage us in live conversations and that activity typically translates into more sales
6328893 psn is dedicated to offering their dealers high value solutions and were proud to play a part
6328894 psn is the perfect partner for contactatonce as we look to markets that can benefit from our solution beyond online automotive marketing where we are already a leader
6328895 rather than just another mass marketing tool we view the internet as what it was originally created for people to talk to one another when you take the time to interact with people and find out what they like and dislike it becomes a very powerful tool

6328900 see this is where he sleeps in the summer he sleeps this side but in winter he moves to the other mattress we have to manage with just these two coolers so he moves to be more comfortable
6328901 with this medal we hope our needs are better looked after than before here there are 20 people to a room with two people to a bed not all rooms have coolers like ours and we have to share the space with rats and other animals here theres room for everybody
6328902 this is how weve been living we have to make do with what we have its very tough but what choice do we have
6328903 perhaps now that sushil had got a medal more money will come into the sport we have brought it to the attention of the authorities many times but it hasnt made a difference so we carry on
6328904 this is him with his 2005 arjuna award and heres another during the 1998 asian cadet junior meet where he won gold now he has an olympic medal
6328905 we are all very proud of what he has achieved and we cant wait to meet him at the airport
6328906 sushil also had the same difficulties but he had said hell win a medal and he did here at the stadium there are wrestlers from all over the country who are living in these conditions and i hope they are all inspired by what he has done wrestlers dont get jobs so many are unwilling to take it up seriously but now things will be different
6328907 callous attitude of the sports authority of india sai administration could seriously hamper indias medal prospects

6328911 we are right on track with where we were last year with occupancy and left to lease even our down markets were not as down in the second quarter this year as those of our competitors
6328912 effective revenue management strategy backed up by a solid system forces a management process that prevents over correcting in leaner times it has helped us in boom times too when managers might have been content with good occupancy and perhaps were slow to push rents higher
6328913 the b product is still a fairly safe place to be even though were seeing rent growth flatten in some markets
6328914 we are carefully watching all our markets continuing to do acquisitions and working to maximize occupancy and maximize revenue
6328915 an important value of using lease rent optimization technology is that it requires we track competitors and watch our renewals more carefully so we can generate daily rents more in tune with our markets it also stabilizes our renewal pace
6328916 people mistakenly believe that when you implement a revenue management system you flip a few switches and everyone turns off their brains
6328917 laramars pricing optimization system requires that our entire team be more engaged with the market and our strategies on a daily basis
6328918 we track our results every year against industry advisers reit indexes and have consistently beat the reit revenue growth numbers every year
6328919 i attribute that almost 100 percent to the lro system we were 80 percent committed to it when we did the system pilot test study and we are 110 percent committed to it now lease rent optimization technology is an integral part of our business practices regardless of market conditions
6328920 i have found that abacast has gone above and beyond to earn our business
6328921 our customized player started out as a simple sketch on an excel spreadsheet abacasts industry knowledge including revenue optimization and user experience innovation enabled them to build a differentiated world class player that is critical to our online radio business they worked very hard to implement every piece of functionality that we dreamed up when our radio markets have a question they usually get a response in the same day that is critical to me
6328922 our eight years experience serving the radio industry with end to end solutions really came through in working with nextmedia radio and winning their business

6328938 seemed a great fit for me because its so fun to find great groups doing great work in communities
6328939 its an inspiring place to be focusing your energy on finding groups doing good work in their own community and bringing them into a network and then plugging in the fans and other people
6328940 a promoter in germany told me that over the years theyve seen so many crazy things on riders like pick out the red m amp ms
6328941 but he thought that at least this was something in the end that seems positive for everyone
6328942 in 2005 the entire attitude in the industry has changed
6328943 now major venues and promoters are rushing to be as green as they can so when the envirorider comes along its really valuable to them it gives them the tools and resources to achieve that
6328944 but because of the finite space and how far away we are it just heightens it

6328948 you dont want to throw away anything you cherish that piece of food
6328949 there are so many lessons weve learned in the garden
6328950 its better to teach hands on about food than from a text book
6328951 especially with increased fuel costs you cant just ship things halfway across the world just to have strawberries all year
6328952 i feel like farm to school solves a whole lot of problems were facing now
6328953 its such a rapid and best solution to so many things
6328954 for us to go out and make a positive change in the music industry has a more positive effect than me just staying home and doing nothing if after we leave people go forward with the connection we help to make while were there that makes touring worth it it makes me feel like we do leave a place better than before we showed up
6328955 at that age when theyre figuring out the way theyre going to approach the world
6328956 doing a show like this gets the kids talking about sustainability it shows them that its not a dorky thing to think about
6328957 thats why it works theyre doing this because its the right thing to do and they want to have a positive impact this is not about jack johnson
6328958 its an understated under promised and over delivered approach to environmentalism jacks the anti politician hes not promising anything hes just doing it hes putting his money where his mouth is
6328959 as a musician you can go out there and say i do drugs and drive fancy cars and make kids think thats cool
6328960 were finding success in terms of connecting with people regardless of whether they live on the coast or whether they surf

6328964 we were able to connect with a lot of people i just love that face time with people and we had lot of good genuine conversations jack really did a lot for us
6328965 jack really made it simple and accessible for people it was about being the greenest you can be wherever you are in that spectrum just try to take it to the next little step
6328966 i think thats important because everyone is in a different situation not everyone is gonna get a hybrid
6328967 ive never been treated better as a volunteer group or felt like i had as much value
6328968 it not only worked its still working as a result
6328969 the only way it continues to get better 20 years from now is to pass it to the next generation
6328970 its being passed around among other tour managers and other bands
6328971 this is my hope that it gets disseminated and becomes the de facto standard
6328972 environmental riders have been steadily increasing during the last year both in the frequency we see these and in the quality of them
6328973 however this was the most complete ive seen so far it covered all areas of the tour and challenged us to think about what we were doing
6328974 it has been quite a change and setup costs were fairly expensive but it will prove to be a savings in the long run both financially and environmentally
6328975 our entire staff truly thinks and does things more consciously
6328976 this year i see more and more artists asking and requiring earth saving measures at their concerts
6328977 i also see the audiences respecting and appreciating the new rules of living

6329002 we went to the pharmacy and the staff were very polite and helpful
6329003 the staff came over and said we had not done it and thats when i asked for an apology
6329004 a week later neighbours told us the police were asking for us we eventually went to parkside police station and they said i was being charged with racially aggravated violence i was in shock
6329005 then the charge was dropped to racially aggravated harassment and abuse
6329006 four members of staff got in the witness box and said they had heard me being racially abusive but each time our solicitor showed the whole thing on cctv footage it was absolutely incredible
6329007 i feel tesco has treated me and my family disgracefully
6329008 they said my husband had been swearing at the pharmacy staff they said we had called her a racially insulting name i told them that wasnt what he said and asked for an apology
6329009 after my husband was cleared in court we went back to tesco in newmarket road but the manager said we were barred and that our whole family was barred its totally out of order we still havent had an apology

6329083 ive long had an interest in such futurist personalities as buckminster fuller and paulo soleri in the subject of environmental sustainability and a fondness for modernist design as well as the more unusual design disciplines such as the multi faceted field of organic design but my concerted study of alternative architecture originated with a very practical need as an mcs multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome patient i have had a critical need for low toxic housing housing free of latently toxic materials that minimize the accumulation of indoor air pollution but discovered that a general ignorance in the homebuilding industry of the nature and origins of materials commonly in use made obtaining such housing in the us a virtually insurmountable challenge though it is possible to build conventional housing with a simple substitution of safe materials for those of dubious safety and a return to some pre wwii building techniques the relative scarcity or increased labor skill overhead of such substitutions can radically increase the costs of a home most of the sufferers of mcs and the often considered related gulf war syndrome are extremely economically challenged due to an inability to tolerate most work environments and so affording even low cost conventional housing is difficult let alone any housing that might cost far more than normal this being my own situation i was compelled to begin exploring the full spectrum of home and industrial building technology and design in the hopes of finding means of both realizing non toxic housing and greatly economizing on its cost compared to conventional housing without any sacrifices in standard of living overlapping as it does the fields of industrial technology environmentalism renewable energy architecture relief aid technology and more through this research i was exposed to not only a remarkable variety of overlooked building methods from the ancient past to the near future but also a largely overlooked history of architectural and industrial design i was particularly intrigued by the long obsession with modular architecture among the classic modernists and the question of why virtually all attempts at making this work for mainstream building have failed despite a century of truly remarkable invention i also became interested in the curious evolution of the sustainable technology and renewable energy movements which originated with the likes of fuller as a very progressive high tech oriented movement changed after the late 70s energy crisis into a soft tech movement with a very anti technology anti modernist stance and in recent times has returned again to a high tech approach riding on the coat tails of new modernism an evolution mirrored in the environmentalist movement in general this all led me to the discovery of the mid century post industrial movement how it related to people like fuller and solari how it once split over the prophesies of cultural revolution and total automation the first incarnation of the idea of singularity and how it has been reinvented reinterpreted over the turn of the century by writers like the swiss activitst author p m alvin toffler chris anderson ray kurzweil kim drexler terence mckenna etc in the emerging maker movement the open source software movement in the nanotechnology development community in the transhumanism community and among the new generation of diamond age science fiction writers i came to notice and was intrigued by how so many people coming from so many completely different directions were arriving at convergent views of the underlying trends of the present and common vision of the future they point towards
6329084 i think the p2p movement is rediscovering something that has existed as a fundamental aspect of true communities since the origin of civilization but which western culture lost the memory of over the industrial age as it systematically disrupted or destroyed traditional communities in favor of new macro communities reducing human beings to economic units and cultivating a mass sociopathy for as long as the human species has existed we have come together in groups for the purpose of cultivating very practical tangible survival critical resources beyond the means of the individual and before the advent of bureaucratic institutional systems p2p was the only way these resources could be created because you simply could not force people to participate in things against their will as long as they had somewhere else to go the original and most basic communal resources were most likely protection sexual opportunity productivity and propriety from these derived countless others culminating in the creation of fixed architecture requiring communal participation to create one of the key benefits of the productivity resource the higher productivity yield from physical labor shared is that through group participation one can construct dwellings of much greater robustness and comfort than is possible for the solitary individual working alone but in order to gain this communal labor in exchange for ones own participation a p2p negotiation must be conducted with ones fellow neighbor builders in order to work out equitable dwelling sizes and acceptable designs and locations the very organic character of the organization of ancient villages and cities is a reflection of the fluid nature of property a function of propriety within this p2p process in small groups this is still a hallmark of p2p activity today as demonstrated by the more organic nature of open source code design compared to its corporate produced counterparts ultimately the architecture of an entire village and its key facilities is worked out in this p2p fashion and over time standards codified as traditions are established to streamline the p2p process across the physical evolution of a community culminating in what we today refer to as architectural vernaculars region culture specific systems of design and methods of construction so in fact p2p architecture is not new it was how most people housed themselves and built their villages and cities for most of human history and how a very large portion of the world still does it wherever true communities have not been supplanted or disrupted by western economics and people of necessity still primarily employ their own labor in a communal fashion to create their homes basically wherever pre industrial and primary cultures still persist in some form around the globe because we have so little functional memory of life before our all encompassing all controlling bureaucratic complexes we tend to over estimate the importance of authority figures in earlier societies assuming that there was always some kind of dictatorial control in communities but in fact the so called rulers had very specialized and limited roles in early society because their authority came from group consensus and they simply had no special knowledge or insight compared to the average person these people functioned primarily as mediators and conflict resolvers not dictators or even organizers indeed anthropologists have noted that no matter who might be sitting in the chiefs seat most often the person who really kept primary culture communities functioning was an especially socially clued in older woman with a talent for communication who functioned as a catalyst of p2p activity and general social harmony the original functional queen bee so rulers might always have the last word but rarely ever the first in the west p2p architecture can only manifest itself in the scarce situations where community can be overlooked or ignored by bureaucrats and authorities seeking to suppress the expression of it especially community that can command any sort of control of real property and economic resources so we tend to see p2p architecture emerge ad hoc entertainment oriented and often temporary in sub cultural special interest communities for instance model plane enthusiasts often build club airports complete with miniature airstrips and air traffic control towers this is sometimes taken to the scale of fly in communities like the one john travolta lives in where private plane enthusiasts create a communal airport which they build their homes around each having a hangar as well as a car garage model train enthusiasts build club train layouts in a shared building sometimes of astounding area groups like the society for creative anachronism and the various civil war re creationist groups establish temporary military camps or villages artists communities often form residential communities around the shared facilities like kilns foundries and galleries urban gardeners collaborate on the creation of community farms and gardens in abandoned lots which its interesting to note american cities such as new york long and violently resisted throughout the 20th century police sent in to destroy such community gardens whenever bureaucrats were made aware of them as such challenges to official urban planning by mere residents were not tolerated and of course theres the burning man festival which is an annual temporary city of p2p managed microvllages that has become a showcase for some of the latest in prefab and temporary architecture itself increasingly the product of p2p projects such as the hexayurt relief housing project but the most functional examples of p2p architecture in the west the closest we get to village creation in the manner of those early societies may be those danish style co housing communities based on actual group participation in the very deliberate design of the community architecture this is usually done with an architectural firm often specialists in co housing working as both a source of base line design concepts as well as a mediator of group negotiations over design however the ultimate common architecture and aesthetic is a product of group consensus and though construction is usually primarily performed by conventional contractors and everything paid for by conventional mortgages sweat equity investment is common as a means of reducing housing costs through group effort the limitation of course is that because of the reliance on professionals to design and build the finished architecture as well as conventional mortgage financing later evolvability of the architecture is precluded or severely diminished which for a functional small community that is architecturally divergent from the conventional forms around it is eventually a death sentence for the community as a whole interestingly this concept has been far more successful in the more culturally progressive regions of europe like scandinavia than in the us here where the lack of heritage made the industrial age suppression of even the real memory of community more complete largely supplanted by the fantasy communities of bedford falls mayberry rfd and walnut grove the fundamental lack of social negotiation skills produces very protracted periods of organization and negotiation in co housing development it typically takes several times longer to organize a co housing project here than anywhere else on the globe and there is a far higher rate of project collapse the concept has been more successful here in the form of master planned co housing communities instigated by architects that people simply buy into after the fact the design left to the experts and the p2p portion of the development process with all that distasteful face to face human interaction largely eliminated ironically eco villages similar as they sometimes are to co housing and often confused with them because there is cross over of sustainable building methods and renewable energy technology rarely employ consensus architecture development in the manner of danish co housing and rarely use common architectural designs or deliberate community pre planning except where imposed upon them by the master plan of an architect this may be explained in that eco communities not instigated by architects rarely actually employ architects and when not architect designed rarely employ the sustainability appropriate village urban densities that necessitate concerted p2p collaboration the lack of cultural memory of functional community architecture may also have something to do with this a lot of environmental enthusiasts tend to think sustainability is all about straw bale and rustic woodwork harbor notions of community that seem to derive more from jrr tolkien than anything in real human history and seek eco community creation as a means of escape from everything symbolically urban so the end result is sometimes eco villages built ad hoc in once pristine wilderness that are about as sustainable and community oriented as a suburban cul de sac of mcmansions with hummers parked in their driveways its ironic that eco communities so often predicated on the objective of demonstrating community ideals so rarely embody an expression of community in their architecture while co housing largely predicated on simply making a better form of suburbia than the market will offer often for the sake of child rearing is often much more functional as community because is has practical rather than idealized reasons for socialization and deliberately crafts habitat to accommodate that with the aid of designers versed at least in the ergonomics that requires

6329091 its a big big game my first for my new club and i want to get off on the right foot
6329092 playing the mariners is exactly the same as when i was with newcastle an f3 derby but the other way
6329093 it would have been nice to make my debut in a home match but gosford really is only 45 minutes up the freeway so hopefully there will be a few sydney fans anyway
6329094 definitely i cant wait for the game weve got a quality squad here and im looking forward to playing with the boys
6329095 ive played a pre season game and had some training sessions and i can tell im going to enjoy it here
6329096 i watched the boys take on melbourne last week and i thought we played well and were good on the ball the only time we were under threat was from breaks
6329097 it was disappointing not to get through to the next stage especially after the build up we had
6329098 argentina dominated us and we had chances to score but we missed them so it was frustrating not to come out of that match with a draw
6329099 against cote divoire we played good football and we should have got something out of that match too
6329100 at that sort of level if you can break down the teams coming forward around the box then youre doing half the job
6329101 especially the argentines who are so good around the box
6329102 im not the fastest man on earth so i compensate for my lack of pace by screening the back four getting on the ball and using it well with vision
6329103 he reads the game beautifully works very hard and is very comfortable on the ball
6329104 actually they are not too similar in their style both can play deep or a bit forward
6329105 what is this this is simply ill mannered and a sign of disrespect to the jalur gemilang what did the jalur gemilang do to them
6329106 the bloggers are only good in making up stories and giving people ideas which are very bad if this happens those doing so are insulting the jalur gemilang and action will be taken against them i hope the police will look into this matter and take the necessary action
6329107 i am so happy this award motivates me further to scale greater heights and if given the opportunity i look forward to helping more malaysians to seek excellence in squash
6329108 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6329109 we are now monitoring the fuel price and i hope it will continue its downward trend
6329110 i was so confident that we will get at least 50 organ donors this year with all the publicity on organ donation in the electronic and print media the road shows seminars and workshops
6329111 but it looks like we are not even reaching half the number
6329112 we have been doing well the past two years but this year the donors are not forthcoming
6329113 even those in the older group knew about organ donation
6329114 we are working closely to render assistance and support needed to secure the release of the ship and crew
6329115 the tanker was still moving with the pirates on board however we have been unable to contact the tanker
6329116 four ships have been hijacked within a month we are concerned over the increasing piracy attacks in the area
6329117 we should not be influenced by those who say that certain communities are being neglected by the government this is a lie as the government has always taken care of the interests of all
6329118 i am very happy to be given such a prestigious award to be honest i am surprised that the state government decided to give me the award despite my second place finish
6329119 when we put her to sleep her brothers will immediately crowd on her mattress to lie next to her
6329120 we hope that the operations will be a success and that nur ajeerah will get a clean bill of health
6329121 this effort is to ensure malaysias growth in aerospace and aviation sectors
6329122 the sector is still a niche market for the country but the potential is enormous as worldwide airline passengers are expected to increase to 2 3 billion by year end
6329123 visitors will be enthralled by the international aerobatic teams that will wow the crowd and colour the city skies
6329124 but why would i need to do any of that when i can get someone else to do it in exchange for sex
6329125 we have investigating officers in sabah and we will assist if they need us
6329126 we are noticing this after the house to house campaigns and small group gatherings
6329127 i think the fence sitters are convinced by the bn campaign and explanations from national leaders
6329128 the opposition is talking about racial unity now whereas the bn government has been practising it for a long time and had looked after the interest of the malays chinese indians muruts and kadazandusun
6329129 i just saw the plight of people using the trains to get to work every morning they were jostling to get on board every time a train arrived there appeared to be no system
6329130 im not happy with this because the people are not getting satisfaction from riding the trains this we must fix
6329131 i found the trains really packed with so many passengers some had waited for three trains and yet could not board
6329132 theres no queue people push their way in women with children and old people are pushed aside

6329171 i must protest aloud against the incorrect interpretation of the situation in the caucasus if the czech government stopped at the unilateral interpretation it would be sad and deplorable and i would strongly frown at the government dont let us introduce further untruths to the world
6329172 the continuing russian military invasion of georgia that violates international law is unacceptable
6329173 one can never know what may happen and it is necessary to defend oneself against it beforehand
6329174 russians do not believe our assurances they do not believe what u s president george bush and others say they just look at where the radar aims and they can see it is aimed at their territory we have simply failed to explain to them that we do not view it as an operation aimed against them

6329352 the most prominent figures in the mural the african american boatmen in the foreground reflect dignity and the communitys respect for them the little known role of these boatmen is honored by this mural which proclaims their important legacy to the community
6329353 if they hadnt been on the river pushing those boats around there would have been no rockingham county
6329354 i didnt see him as getting a free ride and just having fun but i can see how people would see it that way
6329355 it was just something that people wore on their heads i didnt want another hat
6329356 when you see the term research people assume youre talking about sponsored research specifically in the sciences
6329357 she seems to have a comprehensive vision of uncgs strengths and challenges
6329358 universities are social institutions with a responsibility to the public we serve
6329359 the public demands that we also focus on their needs and engage directly in creating knowledge necessary to solve the many pressing problems of our society
6329360 were looking at ways we can bring the business community closer to the work of the universities
6329361 i will work with them and request that they return it as quickly as possible
6329362 they screwed up and there ought to be a penalty to pay and maybe someone ought to lose their job
6329363 its not like we injured someone its not like we gave them an overdose of drugs
6329364 we didnt follow the correct procedures and those procedures are very tough and stringent
6329365 guilford county has put a lot of time in this and bridgeway
6329366 we will do as we did prior to bridgeway opening
6329367 were not taking any official action but weve asked the health department to let us know what theyre up to and if we have any objection well let them know
6329368 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6329369 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6329370 when this all started coming about and the three patients contacted the board of health it was a massive information sharing onslaught by everybody
6329371 which is a good thing because everyone was then on board with what was going on
6329372 there was a bit of a delay on that scheduling and finally it was like we have to get these done now
6329373 hes an outdoorsman who loves to hunt but who also loves plant material and he likes to save these native plants that we are losing to construction and development
6329374 when i found out about it i just didnt want it
6329375 i truly appreciate it but id rather have more plants
6329376 he is indeed a christian but not a syrupy sweet one hes just such an extraordinary person
6329377 its wonderful because it looks just like he is coming out of the woods carrying a plant and shovel
6329378 great pitching great defense some great adjustments at the plate the international tiebreaker the 20 second pitch clock you saw a little bit of what the sport has to offer
6329379 i knew she was going to come with it i just wanted to get my bat on it
6329380 sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6329381 i mean its all about challenge obviously we welcome all comers and we know what a great team greece is argentina theyre the defending champs you want to be able to play the guys who won it the last time
6329382 going into the game i thought we had one advantage and thats a lot for us
6329383 i thought it was patrick mills i thought he was someone their point guards would have trouble with
6329384 im glad my duke team doesnt play st marys this season
6329385 you could hear them talking out in the hall lets go lets go lets go
6329386 theyre a good team and we cant afford to give them easy points kobe made a couple of 3 point shots he was shooting 50 footers by the end of the game
6329387 yeah because of what they did to you the last time
6329388 la sardegna der blick von drinnen und von drau en
6329389 but this is definitely the worst ive seen in 30 years
6329390 nobody can drive everyone either rides a bicycle or their parents give them a ride
6329391 were just starting to reap the benefits of the investment of a lot of people in the community
6329392 when you feel like your opponents outworked you and wanted it more thats kind of humiliating so i arrived at the conclusion that maybe we were being too easy on the kids we were letting them get spoiled not having them set goals not expecting enough so i really put the screws on them
6329393 we have to think physical and every snap we have to come out and play physical i mean in due time well start to jell together in that aspect but as an offense were doing a great job together
6329394 i feel like it was a redshirt year last year
6329395 its real funny because i was coming off a sports hernia injury and i was able to heal up so carolina got a brand new player
6329396 hes a guy thats been with a few teams has got great experience has got a great mind set and work ethic that i think brings a lot to that locker room and that position
6329397 hes a guy that were very pleased with at this point
6329398 i think going from the first preseason game to the second preseason game we got away from some things
6329399 but we had a chance to look at it on film and weve got the third preseason game coming up so we just have to be physical and be consistent up front
6329400 ive played around a lot of young guys and to this point i think jeff is really physical especially coming out of college into the pro game
6329401 hes pretty smart so its all just about being consistent and i think hell get to that point
6329402 hes just a good fit as far as the type of players we went on the o line
6329403 our top pick at this point in time is tata chemicals and we have a price target there of rs 444 i think it combines the best of both the earnings growth compounded will be in excess of more than 25 at the same time unlike the crazy run up in valuations that we have seen across space with respect to be it a chambal fertilisers or nagarjuna valuations are still looking sane and sanguine in the case of tata chemicals its trading at less than ten times on price to earnings and less than six times in ev ebitda less than two times on ev sales which is a very important parameter for valuing fertiliser companies
6329404 in case of tata chemicals the big trigger is the fact that today soda ash prices in the spot market are trading in excess of usd 400 a tonne whereas we have assumed that going forward given the tata chemical contract its soda ash prices every december we have not given them the benefit of more than usd 286 in our assumptions so there could be significant upside and tata chemicals is the only company which has not just announced capex anticipating a positive urea policy unlike the others it has gone ahead and invested in capex and the full impact of the benefit of capacities in urea going up from 0 8 to 1 2 million tonne in the case of tata chemicals will be felt in the q4 of fy09 in the case of chambal and nagarjuna the actual benefits from a capacity increase will only happen 18 20 months down the line so the stocks have gone up more on the back of hoopla because the actual numbers will start playing out only by fy10 in a best case scenario
6329405 anyone who thinks there are more than a few dozen graphic novels worth reading is an idiot
6329406 i guess its fair to say that were getting close to that position at the moment were really really hopeful that there can be some other possible way through
6329407 we would still stay away from utilities and real estate more because of valuations we still have not seen a significant lagged impact of the high rise in interest rates so we would wait for that to happen we would wait for demand to stabilize before venturing out into the real estate sector
6329408 in order to ensure that any investigation of the allegations is fair and free from any question of interference or influence i am taking a leave of absence effective immediately for the duration of the investigation
6329409 i believe these steps will allow our union to continue to serve the best interests of our membership during this time
6329410 these allegations are of serious concern to all of us and we support mr freemans decision to put the best interests of the members first
6329411 let it be clear that we proudly and firmly stand with president freeman and the work of our local
6329412 his resume as a coach and an athlete truly speaks for itself
6329413 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6329414 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people
6329415 the average household has its tv on for eight hours and 14 minutes daily thats a record
6329416 i think about the millions of people who live in apartments in los angeles that dont even have a backyard they need a place to go
6329417 and if they dont have a small local park they could always know they could go to griffith park thats the way my great grandfather saw it
6329418 the only other direction you could do is to commercialize it
6329419 he just saw it as a safety valve for the public
6329420 people like to go there to get away from the city to hike in a quiet area with not too many cars around and just enjoy nature he always wanted it to be a free park and for everybody
6329421 they had this old thing that you cranked around it showed you going into space showed you all the stars
6329422 i dont even remember if i got paid for that job
6329423 it was something i felt i needed to give back to a little bit
6329424 if there were a sentence forever i would certainly give it to you
6329425 i dont believe for a minute you intended to kill yourself or harm yourself in any way
6329426 i think you were setting up a scenario so you could go back to your family
6329427 thank you for looking at me because i want you to know the pain you have caused me
6329428 you did a very bad and stupid thing if you have tried to cause pain and anguish you have definitely succeeded
6329429 because of your selfishness you have bestowed this terrible nightmare upon us and it will never end
6329430 i learned to approach challenges step by step i can see that having leukemia s helping me now its making me stronger because everything i go through in life from now on will be easier than what i went through to bear cancer
6329431 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages
6329432 heres an idea why doesnt everyone just grow up and stop talking about this and let teens read what they want whether a publisher designates it ya or not
6329433 i really have a problem with this book it shouldnt be on the shortlist let alone win
6329434 college guys talk about what theyre reading what they read in high school and what books are important to them now
6329435 we saw some fairly good construction data through the first quarter such as in germany and there is some payback for that
6329436 we know about the implosion of various construction housing bubbles particularly in ireland and spain and to a lesser extent in britain its a pattern that we should probably anticipate going forward
6329437 its fair to say the mayor was upset with the video
6329438 the mayor made it clear in no uncertain terms that city departments were to comply with the water directive just like every business and residence
6329439 the mayor was in no mood to hear excuses he wanted to hear solutions

6329462 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6329498 i love thinking about my future i plan everything out
6329499 he might seem unlikely from the outside but if you saw this work and knew how determined he is you wouldnt think so
6329500 his attitude is hes going to impose his will on you no matter how experienced you are
6329501 its so easy to get into trouble and so hard to get out of it for me it only takes a little bit i dont even want to see what else might happen

6329519 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6329520 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6329521 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6329522 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6329523 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6329524 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to

6329528 vi kunne ikke have fundet en bedre arrangementschef end lars skovgaard han har med stor succes og tr fsikkerhed gjort vega til k benhavns f rende spillested for ny rytmisk musik dr har 80 rs erfaringer med klassisk musik og 60 med jazz men har aldrig i st rre omfang opereret p det rytmiske omr de koncerthuset skal favne alle genrer og udtryk og derfor er det en stor fordel at holdet suppleres med en af branchens st rkeste kort indenfor rytmisk musik
6329529 som jeg ser musikmarkedet bev ger det sig i stigende grad over til at blive et socialt medie noget vi oplever sammen enten live eller deler sammen p nettet og med stillingen som arrangementschef ser jeg et v ld af muligheder for at f et koncerthus med fire sale drs faste ensembler rytmisk musik og klassisk musik til at smelte sammen med tv radio mobil og sidst men ikke mindst nettet ikke kun nationalt men ogs internationalt tror jeg vi kan pirke lidt til hvordan man kan forl nge oplevelser f r under og efter koncerten det gl der jeg mig til komme i gang med

6329531 im anxious to see what hes going to do hes worked hard
6329532 ive said this all along the quarterback spot is a developmental position
6329533 i dont mind having a first year starter but i wish i coached him the three or four years prior to that because you can definitely groove good habits both from a technique standpoint and mentally
6329534 im not sure were there at any point of our program right now but thats just the nature of being new im confident well play well at quarterback down the road
6329535 as quarterbacks we constantly have pressure on us because hes always on us
6329536 always thats a big difference you have to be perfect even if you complete a ball it needs to be better you have to hit him in the face thats definitely a big change for me
6329537 my question is why would you look at it that way at all
6329538 every years a fresh year you have to come beat me first
6329539 i didnt do a very good job of getting myself out there
6329540 i didnt make tapes or do any of that i felt like i was good enough to go d i
6329541 so i came out and talked to coach lubick and all the other coaches and it worked out
6329542 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate postrace competitive analysis
6329543 it called for a serious reaction on our part and we think the penalty speaks to that
6329544 but somebody has to be the first to make change
6329545 what i tried was so unheard of they did not know how to deal with me
6329546 yao shows me respect he should he realizes what i did won the big money for him
6329547 that was the first game my girlfriend came to see me play i scored 40 points and had 30 rebounds on him
6329548 too bad i had already paid for the check i shouldve asked for a discount getting free meals for being a sports celebrity would be very americanized of me dont you think
6329549 i built a bridge it does not matter who did but maybe this did more than something for china maybe it did something for basketball my regret would be if i had not tried
6329550 2004 was miserable for us now weve turned this whole thing around
6329551 in 04 we werent prepared for the world the way we are now
6329552 we want to play the defending olympic champs its all about challenges anyone who has aspirations to be a champion you understand there is a sense of pride that comes along with beating a champion
6329553 were loose were having fun but at the same time were taking care of business
6329554 when i got to bat i was kind of nervous i didnt get a hit because i got beaned the first time
6329555 i just tried to get a base hit and it just came
6329556 i think its always disappointing especially with a character like view slide show of fernando clavijos career with the rapids ask brian forbes about the rapids mls or the game in general in the soccer mailbag visit the rapids stats page for boxscores team leaders division standings and more fernando
6329557 hes a very good man very honest man pretty much all of the group are disappointed
6329558 ive been in the situation three or four times and the toughest training sessions come when a coach leaves the team

6329581 its very nice that the people took the time to care
6329582 we explained that kerry the person that was meant to pick up the cat was missing and asked him if he had seen her and of course he denied that
6329583 something like this happening has always been one of our biggest fears

6329595 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6329596 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6329597 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6329598 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6329599 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6329600 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda

6329624 when prohibition went into effect in america on january 16 1920 it did more than stop the legal sale of alcoholic beverages in our country it increased the production of soft drinks put hundreds of restaurants and hotels out of business spurred the growth of tea rooms and cafeterias and destroyed the last vestiges of fine dining in the united states hotels tried to reclaim some of their lost wine and spirit profits by selling candy and soda pop the fruit cocktail cup often garnished with marshmallows or sprinkled with powdered sugar took the place of oysters on the half shell with champagne and a dinner party opener the american wine industry unable to sell its wines legally quickly turned its vinyards over to juice grapes but only a small portion of the juice from the grapes was marketed as juice most of it was sold for home brewed wine needless to say this home brew was not usually a sophisticated viniferous product but sales of the juice kept many of the vineyards in profits throughout prohibition prohibition also brought about cooking wines and artificially flavored brandy sherry and rum extracts housewives were advised to omit salt when using cooking wines as the wines themselves had been salted to make them undrinkable some cooks gave up on alcoholic touches real or faux altogether the bad alcohol the closing of fine restaurants the sweet foods and drinks that took alcohols place the artificial flavors that were used to simulated alcohol all these things could not help but have a deletrious effect on the american palate
6329625 prohibition with its tremendous impact on the eating habits of the country also had a great deal to do with the introduction of italian food to the masses mary grosvenor ellsworth in
6329626 we cooked them pastas too much we desecrated them with further additions of flour we smothered them in baking dishes and store cheese prohibition changed all that the italians who opened up speakeasies by the thousand were our main recourse in time of trial whole hoards of americans thus got exposed regularly and often to italian food and got a taste for it now we know from experience that properly treated the past is no insipid potato substitute the food served in the speakeasies with mama doing the cooking and papa making the wine in the basement was not quite the same as the food the italians had eaten in the old country sicilian cooking was based on austerity but america was rich and protein rich country and the immigrants were happy to add these symbols of wealth to their cooking and happy that their new american customers liked the result meatballs rich meat sauces veal cutlets cooked with parmesean or with lemon clams ctuffed with buttered herbed crumbs shrimp with wine and garlic and mozzarella in huge chunks to be eaten as appetizer were all foods of abundance developed by italian americans
6329627 brandy used to be a common addition to fruit cakes the taste cooked out but it gave richness to the cake and probably added to the keeping quality in the recipes here given cider lemon juice or other fruit juice is substituted for it

6329630 with the passing of the war america settled down to begin an era of onrushing prosperity
6329631 though the depression did not have any immediate impact or obvious effects on american cookery the food sections of popular magazines never mentioned the terrible plight of many of their readers and only occasionally ran a feature on economical meals still the effects were there subtle but pervasive when and if americans did eat out in the 1930s it was much more likely to be at an inexpensive place serving familiar american food than at a fancy restaurant and those americans were much more likely to order coffee or a sweet inexpensive soft drink rather than unfamiliar and expensive wine to wash down their food the depression also changed the way many americans entertained at home except for the upper echelons of society most families were now maidless which made grand formal dinner parties impossible instead hostesses gave luncheons teas and cozy sunday night suppers around the chafing dish the thirties aslo ushed in an era of womens clubs whether dedicated to charitable activities gardening or the fine art of bridge perhaps as a reaction to the individualistic twenties perhaps as a kind of atavistic huddling together against the harsh realities of the new age and what was eaten when the clubs got together was womens food dainty light frothy sweet creamy and decorated but werent many americans starving in the thirties not really there was hunger of course but it was primarily concentrated in the poorest rural areas and while dust bowl housewives might have had to make their bread inside a drawer to keep the drifting dust out at least there was bread relief agencies and make work jobs helped some of the worst off and low food prices made everyone except the food companies happier sugar prices too were low and in the thirties americans consumed more sugar per capita then they have done before or since
6329632 while the depression brought bread lines soup kitchens hoboes begging for food at middle class doors and thousands of hungry families in devastated parts of rural america starvation was unheard of persistent hunger was more common but it was localized affecting mainly marginalized populations who played a small role in politics or the marketplace after the initial dilocation when local and private relief agences were bankrupted enough federal and state resources seem to have been mobilized to provide enough relief and or jobs to head off serious threats to the nutrition of most of the poor and unemployed particularly in the cities in any event there is no indication in mortaility and other statistics of an overall deterioration in the health of the nation falling food prices seem to have helped studies of low income families in five northern industrial cities during the tough spring of 1933 when the nations economy was in ruins presented a bleak but by no means horrendous picture those whose incomes were over three dollars per person per week not a handsome amount consumed an average of over 3 000 calories per adult male per day those with incomes of two to three dollars per person per week still averaged 2 800 calories per adult male per day while only those on the very bottom the relatively small proportion living on less than two dollars per person lived near the margin of hunger averaging 2 470 calories per day even in southern mill towns the poorer workers still ate better than their counterparts of twenty years earlier while they did cut back on meat fowl fish and fresh fruit they still ate adequate amounts of vegetables freshe and canned this does not mean that the depression did not scar americans whether hungry or not economic hardship was ever present in most americans minds they either experienced it feared it or were concerned about others living through it but unlike the food crises which used to rack the pre industrial world this one took place among food surpluses not shortages
6329633 soup kitchens and the missions state that they can always get meat scaps and day old bread frequently for nothing and always for very little but the vegetables that make up the bulk of the soups and stews which they serve are few and far between and those they can afford are poor and stale arrangements are being made to have baskets at the grand central and pennsylvania station to recieve contributions of fruit and vegetables brough in on trains

6329687 i think this night we took another step im happy i saw things i have doubts about i think we are ready for the next game
6329688 im happy with the draw because the reaction of the team to the last minute was important and good
6329689 i think also in the first half we played good football with style we created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together better with different style
6329690 only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs countered we suffered this is a problem and we have to do something about the problem
6329691 in the second half we lost the style and position and the czechs are a very good team i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat

6329721 the beauty of holding property in the philippines is the low cost of property taxes and maintenance a gbp 30 000 condotel suite may set you back only gbp 200 in property taxes per year and maintenance costs are similarly low when you add in the tax protected status of investments made in your ira and the 8 14 returns through rental income through the condotel advantage you have an incredible roi on a purchase of philippine condotel investment real estate

6329767 ibland blir inte allt som man har t nkt sig
6329768 i want to see you im so attracted to you but i have to tell you something im already kinda seeing someone
6329769 dont tell me that if i hadnt left wed still be together
6329770 people tell me that im leading you on am i i just want you to stay here with me
6329771 youre legs remember how i went crazy over your legs youre going to be ok right
6329772 no matter what has happened ive always tried to be good to you you know that right ive been waiting all these years for you to grow up i never thought youd actually leave
6329773 who am i to tell you what to do i knew you thought about breaking up but i never thought youd actually do it i need to see if im over you before i start dating someone else i really did love you
6329774 were both not happy im going to break up with her will you leave him
6329775 im sorry for everything i did you are the only one who has ever made me feel truly loved
6329776 i think it would be funny if i came all the way here to see you and i went home without a dollar
6329777 youre the only one who has ever told me im worth anything im so sorry im so sorry im so sorry
6329778 i dont know what i did you dropped me like a bad habit
6329779 intuitively having so many choices should make you happier but it can actually make you feel worse
6329780 the more opitons you have the higher your expectations and when your expectations are sky high youre destined for disappointment no matter how good things get
6329781 spending time with people who really know you affords you the freedom to be yourself which increases contentment
6329782 you can have a small close knit gang or various friends that factor into different areas of your life but arent necessarily part of the same group
6329783 what matters most is that you feel open with them and they can be open with you
6329784 in order for the relationship to grow you have to share bits of your more private thoughts
6329785 once you reveal more of yourself and see that these friends accept you for who you really are youll feel connected and therefore happier
6329786 if everything you did in life was safe youd never have any exhilarating moments or crazy experiences to recall both of which give you the sense that youre truly living
6329787 people assume that doing the right thing leads to happiness but actually taking risks does
6329788 when you have limitless funds you tend to be hellbent on accumulating more
6329789 in the process you lose the ability to appreciate what you do want and have difficulty feeling fulfilled
6329790 extra belongings weigh us down and crowd our space making us feel overwhelmed and disorganized
6329791 lightening up will help you regain control and therefore happiness
6329792 if you havent used or admired something in six months part with it no guilt allowed
6329793 overextending yourself induces stress yet it also makes you feel productive like youre contributing something which is important to happiness
6329794 similarly inactivity breeds boredom which inspires feelings of uselessness and discontent but lulls are vital
6329795 essentially all go go go will wipe you out as will a solid diet of nada but a mix of both bingo
6329796 the pressure to keep up is so exhausting that it would seem like the payoff for showing such restraint would be great
6329797 but if you dont stop to savor something pleasurable youre going to wind up miserable
6329798 when you feel completely overwhelmed thats acually when you need to treat yourself the most
6329799 we tend to beat ourselves up but its necessary to let ourselves off the hook
6329800 inevitably youre going to make mistakes and yet you still have to like yourself
6329801 we tend to downplay our successes because we dont want to sound like a braggart but sharing good news is uplifting
6329802 not only are you reflecting on something that made you feel awesome but the other person is going to get excited for you which gives you an even bigger lift
6329803 we convince ourselves that there must be something better out there but mental browsing is a recipe for dissatisfaction
6329804 youre wasting time and energy on doubting a good move just because there was another option or 10 that you didnt choose youll never be happy if you live like this

6329810 im totally not surprised by the news ive been saying all along that she got caught doping when she was scoring 6300 points how can she not be doping and scoring 6800
6329811 i have not seen any of her results since early june and then she comes out here and is producing good performances which was suspicious
6329812 i think this night we took another step im happy i saw things i have doubts about i think we are ready for the next game
6329813 im happy with the draw because the reaction of the team to the last minute was important and good
6329814 i think also in the first half we played good football with style we created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together better with different style
6329815 only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs countered we suffered this is a problem and we have to do something about the problem
6329816 in the second half we lost the style and position and the czechs are a very good team i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat

6329831 software application testing is an incredibly dynamic field and we are seeing significant changes and advances regularly
6329832 utests model could very well be indicative of where the future of software testing services are headed with pressures surrounding faster time to market customer control of testing environments and rapidly remediating application defects it makes sense to provide a saas based on demand model to effectively address these concerns

6329940 i was doing a lot of regional theatre in winnipeg and just dropped out and got a little morose
6329941 and then one day i picked up a rusty old copy of poes poems and tales and read in the biography at the beginning that he had gone through so much death his mother his father his foster mother his foster father his brother his wife i dont know anybody in history who ever suffered that much and yet he was able to take that suffering and use it through his art as a catharsis to heal himself and so i paralleled poe and i wrote my first play

6329947 i think that its going to give not only residents of downtown but businesses a tool thats objective rather than subjective and thats the most important thing here
